Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Segments and Organizational Overview Continuing Operations Xcel Energy Inc. is a public utility holding company. In 2011, Xcel Energys continuing operations included the activity of four utility subsidiaries that serve electric and natural gas customers in eight states. These utility subsidiaries are NSP Minnesota, NSP Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS. These utilities serve customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. Along with WYCO, a joint venture formed with CIG to develop and lease natural gas pipelines, storage and compression facilities, and WGI, an interstate natural gas pipeline company, these companies comprise the continuing regulated utility operations. Xcel Energy Inc.s nonregulated subsidiary is Eloigne, which invests in rental housing projects that qualify for low income housing tax credits. 49 Table of Contents Forward Looking Statements Except for the historical statements contained in this report, the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Managements Strategic Plans Xcel Energys corporate strategy focuses on three core objectives: Obtain stakeholder alignment; Invest in our regulated utility businesses; and Earn a fair return on our utility investments. Achievement of these strategic plans is designed to provide our investors with an attractive total return and our customers with clean, safe, reliable energy at a reasonable price. Below is a discussion of our three primary objectives and how they support our overall strategy. Obtain stakeholder alignment Successful execution of our strategy begins with obtaining stakeholder support for long term decisions and for large investment initiatives, prior to taking action. To avoid excessive risk, it is critical that Xcel Energy reduce regulatory and legislative uncertainty before making long term critical decisions or large capital investments. Stakeholder alignment is achieved by: Delivering operational excellence related to reliability, outage performance and customer satisfaction; Proactively taking actions to ensure public and employee safety related to our power plants, natural gas pipelines, and our transmission and distribution system; Pursuing environmental leadership by reducing emissions, and expanding renewable energy in a cost effective manner; and Creating value for our customers by modernizing our infrastructure and reducing our environmental impact at a reasonable cost, while providing customers with choices like DSM, conservation and renewable energy programs. Invest in our utility business After obtaining stakeholder support, the next phase of our strategy is to invest in our regulated utility businesses. Xcel Energy projects that it will invest approximately $13.4 billion in its utility businesses from 2012 through 2016. Our capital investment plan is expected to modernize our infrastructure, improve system reliability, reduce our impact on the environment, expand the amount of renewable energy available to our customers and meet customer demand. We work hard to make sure these investments provide value to our customers by selecting the most cost effective projects and striving to complete these projects on time, safely and within established budgets. As a result of these investments, Xcel Energy projects that the rate base, or the amount on which Xcel Energy earns a return, will grow at a compounded average annual rate of 7 percent through 2016. 50 Table of Contents Earn a fair return on our utility investment The third phase of our strategy is to earn a fair return on our utility investments. Xcel Energys regulatory strategy is based on filing reasonable base rate requests designed to provide recovery of costs necessary to operate our business and a reasonable return on investment, along with obtaining regulatory approval for rate riders and DSM programs. A rate rider is a mechanism that allows for recovery of certain costs and returns on investments, without the costs and delays of filing a rate case. Xcel Energy believes that our public utility commissions will provide reasonable and timely recovery, and this is a key assumption to achieving our financial objectives. Constructive regulatory outcomes over the last several years are evidence of reasonable regulatory treatment and provide us confidence that we are pursuing the right strategy. Provide an attractive total return Successful execution of the corporate strategic plan should allow Xcel Energy to deliver an attractive total return to our shareholders. Our value proposition is to deliver an attractive total return of about 10 percent through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield. Since 2005, our financial objectives have been to: Deliver a long term annual earnings per share growth rate of 5 percent to 7 percent; Deliver an annual dividend increases of 2 percent to 4 percent; and Maintain senior unsecured debt credit ratings in the BBB+ to A range. We have successfully achieved these financial objectives. Our ongoing earnings have grown approximately 7 percent and our dividend has grown approximately 3 percent annually since 2005. In addition, our current senior unsecured debt credit ratings for Xcel Energy and it utility subsidiaries are in the BBB+ to A range. We believe we are positioned to continue earnings growth of 5 percent to 7 percent and dividend growth of 2 percent to 4 percent at least through 2013. Beyond this timeframe, we anticipate that rate base and earnings growth could moderate. Should this occur, we anticipate having flexibility to increase the dividend at a faster rate in the future, while ensuring a strong balance sheet. Therefore, we believe we are positioned to deliver a 10 percent total return. Financial Review The following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on Xcel Energys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the periods presented, or are expected to have a material impact in the future. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Xcel Energy Inc. The earnings and EPS of each subsidiary discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such subsidiary but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by subsidiary is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to the controlling interest of each subsidiary by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period. Xcel Energys management uses this non GAAP financial measure to evaluate and provide details of earnings results. Xcel Energys management believes that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. This non GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to Xcel Energys consolidated fully diluted EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. 51 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table summarizes the diluted EPS for Xcel Energy: Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 2011 2010 2009 PSCo $ 0.82 $ 0.86 $ 0.72 NSP Minnesota 0.73 0.60 0.64 SPS 0.18 0.17 0.15 NSP Wisconsin 0.10 0.09 0.10 Equity earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 0.04 0.04 0.03 Regulated utility continuing operations 1.87 1.76 1.64 Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs (0.15 ) (0.14 ) (0.14 ) Ongoing diluted earnings per share 1.72 1.62 1.50 COLI settlement and Medicare Part D (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Earnings per share from continuing operations 1.72 1.61 1.49 Earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations 0.01 (0.01 ) GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 1.72 $ 1.62 $ 1.48 Xcel Energys management believes that ongoing earnings provide a meaningful comparison of earnings results and is representative of Xcel Energys fundamental core earnings power. Xcel Energys management uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining whether performance targets are met for performance based compensation, and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Ongoing earnings exclude the impact of IRS tax and interest adjustments related to the COLI program, the write off of previously recognized tax benefits relating to Medicare Part D subsidies due to the enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a settlement related to the previously discontinued COLI program. See below under Adjustments to GAAP Earnings and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Adjustments to GAAP Earnings Impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Medicare Part D In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law. The law includes provisions to generate tax revenue to help offset the cost of the new legislation. One of these provisions reduces the deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare Part D coverage, beginning in 2013. Based on this provision, Xcel Energy is subject to additional taxes and is required to reverse previously recorded tax benefits in the period of enactment. Xcel Energy expensed approximately $17 million, or $0.04 per share, of previously recognized tax benefits relating to Medicare Part D subsidies during the first quarter of 2010. Xcel Energy does not expect the $17 million of additional tax expense to recur in future periods. COLI During 2007, Xcel Energy Inc. and PSCo reached a settlement with the IRS related to a dispute associated with its COLI program. These COLI policies were owned and managed by PSRI. As a follow on to the 2007 IRS COLI settlement, during 2010, they reached an agreement in principle of Xcel Energy Inc.s and PSCos statements of account, dating back to tax year 1993. Upon completion of this review, PSRI recorded a net non recurring tax and interest charge of approximately $9.4 million in 2010. The Tax Court proceedings were dismissed in December 2010 and January 2011. Upon final cash settlement in 2011, Xcel Energy received $0.7 million and recognized a further reduction of expense of $0.3 million. A closing agreement covering tax years 2003 through 2007 was finalized with the IRS in January 2012. In 2010, Xcel Energy Inc., PSCo and PSRI entered into a settlement agreement with Provident Life & Accident Insurance Company (Provident) related to all claims asserted by Xcel Energy Inc., PSCo and PSRI against Provident in a lawsuit associated with the discontinued COLI program. Under the terms of the settlement, Xcel Energy Inc., PSCo and PSRI were paid $25 million by Provident and Reassure America Life Insurance Company resulting in approximately $0.05 of non recurring earnings per share in 2010. The $25 million proceeds were not subject to income taxes. 52 Table of Contents Earnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings) 2011 Comparison with 2010 Xcel Energy Overall, ongoing earnings increased $0.10 per share for 2011. Ongoing earnings increased primarily due to higher electric margins as a result of warmer than normal summer weather across Xcel Energys service territories and rate increases in various states. The higher margins were partially offset by expected increases in O&M expenses, depreciation, interest expense and property taxes. The increase in expenses was largely driven by capital investment in Xcel Energys utility business. PSCo PSCo earnings decreased $0.04 per share for 2011. The decrease is due to the implementation of seasonal rates in June 2010 (seasonal rates are higher in the summer months and lower throughout the other months of the year), higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes, partially offset by the favorable impact of warmer temperatures in the summer. NSP Minnesota NSP Minnesota earnings increased $0.13 per share for 2011. The increase is primarily due to higher interim electric rates effective in early 2011, subject to refund, in Minnesota and North Dakota, and conservation program incentives partially offset by higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense (net of regulatory adjustments) and property taxes. SPS SPS earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2011. The increase is due to higher electric revenues, primarily due to the Texas retail rate increase effective in the first quarter of 2011, and warmer summer weather, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, depreciation expense and property taxes. NSP Wisconsin NSP Wisconsin earnings increased $0.01 per share for 2011. The increase is primarily due to higher electric rates, partially offset by higher O&M expenses and depreciation expense. 2010 Comparison with 2009 Xcel Energy Overall, ongoing earnings increased $0.12 per share for 2010. Higher 2010 ongoing earnings were primarily due to improved electric margins as a result of new rates in various jurisdictions and warmer summer temperatures, which were partially offset by higher O&M expenses and property taxes. PSCo PSCo earnings increased $0.14 per share for 2010. The increase was due to higher electric margin resulting from the full effect of two general rate increases, and warmer temperatures, which increased electric sales. The rate increases reflect the significant capital investments that PSCo has made in its utility operations. In addition, PSCos electric operations substantially under earned its authorized return in 2009. The higher electric margin was partially offset by higher O&M expenses, higher property tax expense and depreciation expense. NSP Minnesota NSP Minnesota earnings decreased $0.04 per share for 2010. The decrease was primarily due to higher O&M expenses, property taxes and depreciation expense partially offset by the positive impact of warmer temperatures, higher earned incentives on energy efficiency and conservation programs and modest normalized sales growth. SPS SPS earnings increased $0.02 per share in 2010. The increase was primarily due to electric sales growth, particularly in the commercial and industrial customer class, the reversal of previously established fuel reserves following the regulatory approval of certain settlement agreements and lower interest expense, which was partially offset by higher O&M expenses. NSP Wisconsin NSP Wisconsin earnings decreased $0.01 per share for 2010. The decrease was primarily due to fuel recovery and higher O&M expenses, partially offset by warmer temperatures which increased electric sales, as well as new electric rates, that were effective in January 2010. Equity Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries The increase was primarily related to increased earnings from the equity investment in WYCO related to a natural gas storage facility that began operating in mid 2009. 53 Table of Contents Changes in Diluted EPS The following table summarizes significant components contributing to the changes in the diluted EPS compared with prior periods, which are discussed in more detail later.

Estimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings Unseasonably hot summers or cold winters increase electric and natural gas sales while, conversely, mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances and the amount of natural gas or electricity the average customer historically uses per degree of temperature. Accordingly, deviations in weather from normal levels can affect Xcel Energys financial performance. Degree day or Temperature Humidity Index (THI) data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each days average temperature and humidity. Heating degree days (HDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below 65 Fahrenheit, and cooling degree days (CDD) is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above 65 Fahrenheit. Each degree of temperature above 65 Fahrenheit is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65 Fahrenheit is counted as one heating degree day. In Xcel Energys more humid service territories, a THI is used in place of CDD, which adds a humidity factor to CDD. HDD, CDD and THI are most likely to impact the usage of Xcel Energys residential and commercial customers. Industrial customers are less weather sensitive. Normal weather conditions are defined as either the 20 year or 30 year average of actual historical weather conditions. The historical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction based on the time period used by the regulator in establishing estimated volumes in the rate setting process. The percentage increase (decrease) in normal and actual HDD, CDD and THI are as follows: 2011 vs. 2010 vs. 2011 vs. 2009 vs. 2010 vs. Normal Normal (a) 2010 (a) Normal 2009 HDD (1.0 ) % (4.3 ) % 3.5 % 0.4 % (5.0 )% CDD 38.1 11.9 23.4 (10.5 ) 23.8 THI 37.9 29.9 6.1 (34.5 ) 95.1 (a) Adjusted for the October 2010 sale of SPS electric distribution assets to the city of Lubbock, Texas. Weather The following table summarizes the estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with sales under normal weather conditions: 2011 vs. 2010 vs. 2011 vs. 2009 vs. 2010 vs. Normal Normal 2010 Normal 2009 Retail electric $ 0.07 $ 0.04 $ 0.03 $ (0.05 ) $ 0.09 Firm natural gas 0.00 (0.01 ) 0.01 0.00 (0.01 ) Total $ 0.07 $ 0.03 $ 0.04 $ (0.05 ) $ 0.08 Sales Growth (Decline) The following table summarizes Xcel Energys sales growth (decline) for actual and weather normalized sales for the years ended Dec. 31, compared with the previous year: Dec. 31, 2011 Dec. 31, 2010 Weather Weather Weather Normalized Weather Normalized Actual Normalized Lubbock (a) Actual Normalized Lubbock (a) Electric residential 0.5 % (0.5 ) % 0.2 % 4.6 % 0.7 % 0.9 % Electric commercial and industrial 0.3 0.0 0.7 2.6 1.4 1.6 Total retail electric sales 0.4 (0.1 ) 0.6 3.1 1.2 1.4 Firm natural gas sales 0.9 (2.5 ) N/A (2.9 ) (0.2 ) N/A (a) Adjusted for the October 2010 sale of SPS electric distribution assets to the city of Lubbock, Texas. 56 Table of Contents During 2010, Xcel Energy experienced slightly higher than anticipated actual electric residential, commercial and industrial sales on a weather adjusted basis, as the economy started to improve. Sales in 2011 were lower than anticipated in the residential, commercial and industrial segments due to weak economic recovery. Xcel Energy anticipates that sales in the future will grow at a slower rate than historical levels, due in part to increased conservation activities. Weather normalized sales for 2012 are projected to grow approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent for retail electric customers and to remain relatively flat for retail firm natural gas customers. Electric Revenues and Margin Electric revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses are largely impacted by the fluctuation in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium used in the generation of electricity, but as a result of the design of fuel recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses, these price fluctuations have little impact on electric margin. The following table details the electric revenues and margin: (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Electric revenues $ 8,767 $ 8,452 $ 7,705 Electric fuel and purchased power (3,992 ) (4,011 ) (3,672 ) Electric margin $ 4,775 $ 4,441 $ 4,033 The following tables summarize the components of the changes in electric revenues and electric margin for the years ended Dec. 31: Electric Revenues (Millions of Dollars) 2011 vs. 2010 Revenue requirements for PSCo gas generation acquisition (a) $ 124 Retail rate increases (net of revenue subject to refund) (b) 102 Transmission revenue 45 Conservation and DSM revenue (offset by expenses) 31 Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 19 Estimated impact of weather 18 Conservation and DSM incentive 14 Trading, including PSCo renewable energy credit sales (19 ) Other, net (19 ) Total increase in electric revenue $ 315 (a) The increase in revenue requirements for PSCo generation reflects the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities in late 2010. These revenue requirements are partially offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation expense, property taxes and financing costs. (b) The retail rate increases include final rates in Wisconsin and Texas and interim rates, subject to refund, in Minnesota and North Dakota. The rate increases are net of a provision for refund of approximately $67 million for Minnesota and $2.3 million for North Dakota, based on settlements reached with various parties in both cases. In addition, NSP Minnesota reduced depreciation expense and revenues by approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reflect the proposed settlement in the Minnesota electric rate case. These settlements are pending commission decisions in both Minnesota and North Dakota. 2011 Comparison with 2010 Electric revenues increased primarily due to the cost recovery of the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities at PSCo and retail rate increases in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, North Dakota and Michigan. 57 Table of Contents Electric Margin (Millions of Dollars) 2011 vs. 2010 Revenue requirements for PSCo gas generation acquisition (a) $ 124 Retail rate increases (net of revenue subject to refund) (b) 102 Conservation and DSM revenue (offset by expenses) 31 Transmission revenue, net of costs 20 Estimated impact of weather 18 Conservation and DSM incentive 14 Non fuel riders (5 ) Other, net (including firm wholesale and deferred fuel adjustments) 30 Total increase in electric margin $ 334 (a) The increase in revenue requirements for PSCo generation reflects the acquisition of the Rocky Mountain and Blue Spruce natural gas facilities in late 2010.

Natural Gas Revenues and Margin The cost of natural gas tends to vary with changing sales requirements and the cost of natural gas purchases. However, due to the design of purchased natural gas cost recovery mechanisms to recover current expenses for sales to retail customers, fluctuations in the cost of natural gas have little effect on natural gas margin.

The following tables summarize the changes in O&M expenses: (Millions of Dollars) 2011 vs. 2010 Higher plant generation costs $ 22 Higher labor and contract labor costs 18 Higher employee benefit expense 13 Higher nuclear plant operation costs 12 Higher insurance costs 4 Other, net 14 Total increase in O&M expenses $ 83 2011 Comparison to 2010 The increase in O&M expenses for 2011 was largely driven by the following: Higher plant generation costs are attributable to incremental costs associated with new generation placed in service and a higher level of scheduled maintenance and overhaul work. Higher labor and contract labor costs are primarily due to maintenance on our distribution facilities and the impact of annual wage increases. Higher employee benefit costs are largely driven by higher pension expense. Higher nuclear plant operation costs were largely driven by outages. (Millions of Dollars) 2010 vs. 2009 Higher plant generation costs $ 47 Higher labor costs 24 Higher nuclear plant operation costs 20 Higher contract labor costs 18 Higher employee benefit expense 15 Higher nuclear outage costs, net of deferral 10 Other, net 15 Total increase in O&M expenses $ 149 2010 Comparison to 2009 The increase in O&M expenses for 2010 was largely driven by the following: Higher plant generation costs are primarily attributable to the timing of planned maintenance and overhaul work as well as incremental operating costs associated with new generation facilities placed in service in 2010. Higher contract labor is primarily related to maintenance on our distribution facilities. Higher nuclear plant operation costs are mainly due to increased labor and security expenses. Higher labor costs are primarily due to higher overtime for storm restoration work and a shift in labor resources from capital to O&M projects. Higher nuclear outage costs are due to the timing and higher cost of nuclear refueling outages. Higher employee benefit costs for the year are primarily due to increased pension costs partially offset by lower health care costs. Conservation and DSM Program Expenses Conservation and DSM program expenses increased $41.6 million, or 17.3 percent for 2011, compared with 2010. The higher expense is primarily attributable to an increase in the rider rates used to recover the program expenses. Conservation and DSM program expenses are generally recovered in our major jurisdictions concurrently through riders and base rates. Overall, the programs are designed to encourage the operating companies and their retail customers to conserve energy or change energy usage patterns in order to reduce peak demand on the gas or electric system. This, in turn, reduces the need for additional plant capacity, reduces emissions, serves to achieve other environmental goals as well as reduces energy costs to participating customers. Conservation and DSM program expenses increased $57.7 million for 2010, compared with 2009. The higher expense was attributable to the continued expansion of programs and regulatory commitments. 61 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased $31.7 million, or 3.7 percent for 2011, compared with 2010. This increase in depreciation expense is primarily due to several capital projects going into service, including a portion of the Monticello extended power uprate going into service in May 2011, the Nobles wind project commencing commercial operations in late 2010, the acquisition of two PSCo gas generation facilities in December 2010, Jones Unit 3 going into service in June 2011 and normal system expansion. The increase was partially offset due to NSP Minnesota reducing depreciation expense by approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reflect the proposed settlement in the Minnesota electric rate case. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $40.8 million, or 5.0 percent for 2010, compared with 2009. The change in depreciation expense was primarily due to Comanche Unit 3 going into service and normal system expansion. Taxes (Other Than Income Taxes) Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $42.9 million, or 12.9 percent for 2011, compared with 2010. The change is primarily due to an increase in 2011 for property taxes of approximately $29.6 million in Colorado and $8.8 million in Minnesota. Taxes (other than income taxes) increased $25.5 million, or 8.3 percent for 2010, compared with 2009. The change was primarily due to an increase in property taxes in Colorado and in Minnesota. Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased $21.9 million for 2011, compared with 2010, and increased $21.4 million for 2010, compared with 2009. The changes were primarily due to the COLI settlement in July 2010. AFUDC AFUDC decreased $5.4 million, or 6.4 percent for 2011, compared with 2010. The decrease is primarily due to lower AFUDC rates and lower average CWIP. The lower average CWIP is attributed to Comanche Unit 3 and the Nobles wind project going into service in 2010, offset by Monticello extended power uprate and work at the Jones plant, as well as SPS transmission projects in 2011. AFUDC decreased $30.7 million for 2010, compared with 2009. The decrease was partially due to Comanche Unit 3 going into service in May 2010, as well as lower interest rates. Interest Charges Interest charges increased $13.8 million, or 2.4 percent for 2011, compared with 2010, and $15.6 million, or 2.8 percent for 2010, compared with 2009. The increase was due to higher long term debt levels necessary to fund investments in utility operations, partially offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes Income tax expense for continuing operations increased $31.7 million for 2011, compared with 2010. The increase is primarily due to higher pretax income, a net change in tax valuation allowances of $8.9 million, and the non taxability of the Provident settlement in 2010. These were partially offset by the 2010 write off of the tax benefit for Medicare Part D subsidies, an adjustment related to COLI and an increase in 2011 wind production tax credits. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 35.8 percent for 2011, compared with 36.7 percent for 2010. The higher effective tax rate for 2010 was primarily due to the Medicare Part D, COLI, and the valuation allowance adjustments referenced above. Without these adjustments, the effective tax rate for continuing operations for 2010 would have been 35.1 percent. See Note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on COLI. Income tax expense for continuing operations increased $65.3 million for 2010, compared with 2009. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, and one time adjustments for a write off of tax benefit previously recorded for Medicare Part D subsidies and an adjustment related to the COLI Tax Court proceedings. This was partially offset by a reversal of a valuation allowance for certain state tax credit carryovers. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 36.7 percent for 2010 compared with 35.1 percent for 2009. The higher effective tax rate for 2010 was primarily due to the adjustments referenced above. The effective tax rate for ongoing earnings for 2010 was 35.3 percent. Premium on Redemption of Preferred Stock Xcel Energy Inc. redeemed all series of its preferred stock on Oct. 31, 2011, at an aggregate purchase price of $108 million, plus accrued dividends. As such, the redemption premium of $3.3 million and accrued dividends are reflected as reductions to earnings available to common shareholders for 2011. 62 Table of Contents Xcel Energy Inc. and Other Results The following tables summarize the net income and earnings per share contributions of the continuing operations of Xcel Energy Inc. and its nonregulated businesses: Contribution to Xcel Energys Earnings (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs $ (63.8 ) $ (68.7 ) $ (65.6 ) Eloigne (2.9 ) 5.4 (4.7 ) Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results (0.6 ) 3.0 7.8 Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs continuing operations (67.3 ) (60.3 ) (62.5 ) Preferred dividends (6.8 ) (4.2 ) (4.2 ) Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs, available to common shareholders $ (74.1 ) $ (64.5 ) $ (66.7 ) Contribution to Xcel Energys Earnings per Share (Earnings per Share) 2011 2010 2009 Xcel Energy Inc. financing costs $ (0.13 ) $ (0.15 ) $ (0.14 ) Eloigne (0.01 ) 0.01 (0.01 ) Xcel Energy Inc. taxes and other results 0.00 0.01 0.02 Preferred dividends (0.01 ) (0.01 ) (0.01 ) Total Xcel Energy Inc. and other costs continuing operations $ (0.15 ) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.14 ) Xcel Energy Inc.s results include interest expense and the earnings per share impact of preferred dividends, which are incurred at Xcel Energy Inc. and are not directly assigned to individual subsidiaries. Factors Affecting Results of Operations Xcel Energys utility revenues depend on customer usage, which varies with weather conditions, general business conditions and the cost of energy services. Various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and natural gas service within their respective jurisdictions and affect Xcel Energys ability to recover its costs from customers. The historical and future trends of Xcel Energys operating results have been, and are expected to be, affected by a number of factors, including those listed below. General Economic Conditions Economic conditions may have a material impact on Xcel Energys operating results. Management cannot predict the impact of a prolonged economic recession, fluctuating energy prices, terrorist activity, war or the threat of war. However, Xcel Energy could experience a material impact to its results of operations, future growth or ability to raise capital resulting from a sustained general slowdown in economic growth or a significant increase in interest rates. Fuel Supply and Costs Xcel Energys operating utilities have varying dependence on coal, natural gas and uranium. Changes in commodity prices are generally recovered through fuel recovery mechanisms and have very little impact on earnings. However, availability of supply, the potential implementation of a carbon tax and unanticipated changes in regulatory recovery mechanisms could impact our operations. See Item 1 for further discussion of fuel supply and costs. Pension Plan Costs and Assumptions Xcel Energy has significant net pension and postretirement benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets. Xcel Energy evaluates these key assumptions at least annually by analyzing current market conditions, which include changes in interest rates and market returns. Changes in the related net pension and postretirement benefits costs and funding requirements may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions. For further discussion and a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, see Employee Benefits under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 63 Table of Contents Regulation FERC and State Regulation The FERC and various state regulatory commissions regulate Xcel Energy Inc.s utility subsidiaries. Decisions by these regulators can significantly impact Xcel Energys results of operations. Xcel Energy expects to periodically file for rate changes based on changing energy market and general economic conditions. The electric and natural gas rates charged to customers of Xcel Energy Inc.s utility subsidiaries are approved by the FERC or the regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate. The rates are generally designed to recover plant investment, operating costs and an allowed return on investment. Xcel Energy requests changes in rates for utility services through filings with the governing commissions. Because comprehensive general rate changes are not requested annually in some states, changes in operating costs can affect Xcel Energys financial results. In addition to changes in operating costs, other factors affecting rate filings are new investments, sales growth, which is affected by overall economic conditions, conservation and DSM efforts and the cost of capital. In addition, the ROE authorized is set by regulatory commissions in rate proceedings. Wholesale Energy Market Regulation Wholesale energy markets in the Midwest are operated by MISO to centrally dispatch all regional electric generation and apply a regional transmission congestion management system. NSP Minnesota and NSP Wisconsin expect to recover MISO charges through either base rates or various recovery mechanisms. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Capital Expenditure Regulation Xcel Energy Inc.s utility subsidiaries make substantial investments in plant additions to build and upgrade power plants, and expand and maintain the reliability of the energy transmission and distribution systems. In addition to filing for increases in base rates charged to customers to recover the costs associated with such investments, the CPUC, MPUC, SDPUC and PUCT approved proposals to recover, through a rate rider, costs to upgrade generation plants and lower emissions, and or increase transmission investment cost. These non fuel rate riders are expected to provide significant cash flows to enable recovery of costs incurred on a timely basis. For wholesale electric transmission services, Xcel Energy has, consistent with FERC policy, implemented or proposed to establish formula rates for each of the utility subsidiaries that will provide annual rate changes as transmission investments increase in a manner similar to the rate riders. Environmental Matters Environmental costs include payments for nuclear plant decommissioning, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, disposal of hazardous materials and waste, remediation of contaminated sites, monitoring of discharges to the environment and compliance with laws and permits with respect to Xcel Energys air emissions. A trend of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation may continue to cause, higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance. In addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses, costs charged to operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and waste were approximately: $265 million in 2011; $256 million in 2010; and $225 million in 2009. Xcel Energy estimates an average annual expense of approximately $317 million from 2012 through 2016 for similar costs. However, the precise timing and amount of environmental costs, including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials, are currently unknown. Additionally, the extent to which environmental costs will be included in and recovered through rates may fluctuate. Capital expenditures for environmental improvements at regulated facilities were approximately: $48 million in 2011; $473 million in 2010; and $89 million in 2009. See Item 7 Capital Requirements for further discussion. 64 Table of Contents Xcel Energys operations are subject to air, water, and particulate matter state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate air emissions from various sources, including electrical generating units, and impose certain monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require Xcel Energy to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects that increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits that contain emission and operational limitations or mandate the installation and operation of expensive pollution control equipment at facilities. Xcel Energy will likely be required to incur capital expenditures in the future to comply with these requirements for remediation plans of MGP sites and various regulations for air emissions and water intake. Actual expenditures could be higher or lower than the estimates presented, and the scope and timing of these expenditures cannot be fully determined until any new or revised regulations become final. In July 2011, the EPA issued the CSAPR, to address long range transport of particulate matter and ozone by requiring reductions in SO2 and NOx from utilities located in the eastern half of the U.S. On Dec. 30, 2011, the D.C. Circuit issued a stay of the CSAPR, pending completion of judicial review of the rule. The states in which Xcel Energy operates are currently considering SIPs which may be superseded by CAIR and or CSAPR. Xcel Energy is in the process of determining various scenarios to respond to the CSAPR uncertainty. In addition, there are emission controls, known as BART, for industrial facilities emitting air pollutants that reduce visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas throughout the U.S. Xcel Energy generating facilities in several states will be subject to BART requirements. Further, generating facilities throughout the Xcel Energy territory are subject to mercury reduction requirements at the state level. In December 2011, the EPA adopted a regulation setting national emission limits for electric generating units for mercury, certain metals, and acid gas emissions. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of Xcel Energys environmental contingencies. Inflation Inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect Xcel Energys prices or returns to shareholders. However, potential future inflation resulting from the economic and monetary stimulus policies of the U.S. Government and the Federal Reserve could lead to future price increases for materials and services required to deliver electric and natural gas services to customers. These potential cost increases could in turn lead to increased prices to customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and anticipated recovery of costs. These judgments could materially impact the consolidated financial statements and disclosures, based on varying assumptions. In addition, the financial and operating environment may have a significant effect on the operation of our business and on the results reported even if the nature of the accounting policies applied have not changed. The following is a list of accounting policies that are most critical to the portrayal of Xcel Energys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Each of these has a higher potential likelihood of resulting in materially different reported amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions. Each critical accounting policy has been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Xcel Energy Inc.s Board of Directors. Regulatory Accounting Xcel Energy Inc. is a holding company with rate regulated subsidiaries that are subject to the accounting for Regulated Operations, which provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates will be charged and collected. Xcel Energys rates are derived through the ratemaking process, which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities based on the probability of future cash flows. Regulatory assets represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or amounts collected in current rates for future costs. In other businesses or industries, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would generally be charged to net income or OCI. 65 Table of Contents As of Dec. 31, 2011 and 2010, Xcel Energy has recorded regulatory assets of $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion and regulatory liabilities of $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Each subsidiary is subject to regulation that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If future recovery of costs, in any such jurisdiction, ceases to be probable, Xcel Energy would be required to charge these assets to current net income or OCI. While there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets, if the SEC should mandate the use of IFRS the lack of an accounting standard for rate regulated entities under IFRS could require us to charge certain regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities to net income or OCI. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory assets and liabilities. Income Tax Accruals Judgment, uncertainty, and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes. Uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals require that judgment and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of the ETR. ETRs are also highly impacted by assumptions. ETR calculations are revised every quarter based on best available year end tax assumptions (income levels, deductions, credits, etc.) by legal entity; adjusted in the following year after returns are filed, with the tax accrual estimates being trued up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns; and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities have been completed. In accordance with the interim reporting guidance, a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to eliminate the difference in continuing operations tax expense computed based on the actual year to date ETR and the forecasted annual ETR. Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. The change in the unrecognized tax benefits needs to be reasonably estimated based on evaluation of the nature of uncertainty, the nature of event that could cause the change and an estimated range of reasonably possible changes. At any period end, and as new developments occur, management will use prudent business judgment to derecognize appropriate amounts of tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits can be recognized as issues are favorably resolved and loss exposures decline. As disputes with the IRS and state tax authorities are resolved over time, we may need to adjust our unrecognized tax benefits and interest accruals to the updated estimates needed to satisfy tax and interest obligations for the related issues. These adjustments may be favorable or unfavorable, increasing or decreasing earnings. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Employee Benefits Xcel Energys pension costs are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of key assumptions, most notably the annual return level that pension investment assets will earn in the future and the interest rate used to discount future pension benefit payments to a present value obligation for financial reporting. In addition, the actuarial calculation uses an asset smoothing methodology to reduce the volatility of varying investment performance over time. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the rate of return and discount rate used in the calculation of pension costs and obligations. Pension costs and funding requirements are expected to increase in the next few years. While investment returns exceeded the assumed levels from 2009 2011, investment returns in 2007 and 2008 were significantly below the assumed levels. The pension cost calculation uses a market related valuation of pension assets. Xcel Energy uses a calculated value method to determine the market related value of the plan assets. The market related value is determined by adjusting the fair market value of assets at the beginning of the year to reflect the investment gains and losses (the difference between the actual investment return and the expected investment return on the market related value) during each of the previous five years at the rate of 20 percent per year. As these differences between the actual investment returns and the expected investment returns are incorporated into the market related value, the differences are recognized over the expected average remaining years of service for active employees. Based on current assumptions and the recognition of past investment gains and losses, Xcel Energy currently projects that the pension costs recognized for financial reporting purposes will increase from an expense of $47.8 million in 2010 and an expense of $81.0 million in 2011 to an expense of $124.1 million in 2012 and expense of $138.1 million in 2013. The expected increase in the 2012 expense is due to the continued phase in of unrecognized plan losses primarily resulting from the market decline in 2008. 66 Table of Contents At Dec. 31, 2011, Xcel Energy set the rate of return used to measure pension costs at 7.5 percent, which is a 29 basis point decrease from Dec. 31, 2010. The rate of return used to measure postretirement health care costs of 7.5 percent at Dec. 31, 2011 was unchanged from Dec. 31, 2010. Xcel Energy set the discount rate used to value the Dec. 31, 2011 pension and postretirement health care obligations at 5.0 percent, which is a 50 basis point decrease from Dec. 31, 2010. Xcel Energy uses multiple reference points in determining the discount rate, including Citigroup Pension Liability Discount Curve, the Citigroup Above Median Curve and bond matching studies. At Dec. 31, 2011, these reference points supported the selected rate. In addition to these reference points, Xcel Energy also reviews general actuarial survey data to assess the reasonableness of the discount rate selected. The Pension Protection Act changed the minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2008. The following are the pension funding contributions, both voluntary and required, made by Xcel Energy for 2010 through 2012: In January 2012, contributions of $190.5 million were made across four of Xcel Energys pension plans; In 2011, contributions of $137.3 million were made across three of Xcel Energys pension plans; In 2010, contributions of $34 million were made to the Xcel Energy Pension Plan. For future years, we anticipate contributions will be made as necessary. These expected contributions are summarized in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations. Therefore, additional contributions could be required in the future. If Xcel Energy were to use alternative assumptions at Dec. 31, 2011, a one percent change would result in the following impact on 2012 pension expense: Pension Costs (Millions of Dollars) +1% 1% Rate of return $ (29.1 ) $ 29.6 Discount rate (16.5 ) 19.2 Effective Dec. 31, 2011, Xcel Energy reduced its initial medical trend assumption from 6.5 percent to 6.3 percent. The ultimate trend assumption remained unchanged at 5.0 percent. The period until the ultimate rate is reached remained unchanged at eight years. Xcel Energy bases its medical trend assumption on the long term cost inflation expected in the health care market, considering the levels projected and recommended by industry experts, as well as recent actual medical cost increases experienced by Xcel Energys retiree medical plan. Xcel Energy contributed $49.0 million and $48.4 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, to the postretirement health care plans. Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $39.1 million during 2012. Xcel Energy recovers employee benefits costs in its regulated utility operations consistent with accounting guidance with the exception of the areas noted below. NSP Minnesota recognizes pension expense in all regulatory jurisdictions based on expense as calculated using the aggregate normal cost actuarial method. Differences between aggregate normal cost and expense as calculated are deferred as a regulatory liability. Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and FERC jurisdictions allow the recovery of other post retirement benefit costs only to the extent that recognized expense is matched by cash contributions to an irrevocable trust. Xcel Energy has consistently funded at a level to allow full recovery of costs in these jurisdictions. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 67 Table of Contents Nuclear Decommissioning Xcel Energy recognizes liabilities for the expected cost of retiring tangible long lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These AROs are recognized at fair value as incurred and are capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived assets. In the absence of quoted market prices, Xcel Energy estimates the fair value of its AROs using present value techniques, in which it makes various assumptions including estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with retirement activities, credit adjusted risk free rates and cost escalation rates. When Xcel Energy revises any assumptions used to estimate AROs, it adjusts the carrying amount of both the ARO liability and the related long lived asset. Xcel Energy accretes ARO liabilities to reflect the passage of time using the interest method. A significant portion of Xcel Energys AROs relates to the future decommissioning of NSP Minnesotas nuclear facilities. The total obligation for nuclear decommissioning currently is expected to be funded 100 percent by the external decommissioning trust fund. The difference between regulatory funding (including depreciation expense less returns from the external trust fund) and amounts recorded under current accounting guidance are deferred as a regulatory asset. The amounts recorded for AROs related to future nuclear decommissioning were $1,482.7 million and $809.5 million as of Dec. 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Based on their significance, the following discussion relates specifically to the AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning. NSP Minnesota obtains periodic site specific cost studies in order to estimate the nature, cost and timing of planned nuclear decommissioning activities. These independent third party cost studies are based on relevant information available at the time performed; however, estimates of future cash flows for extended periods of time are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. In December 2011, NSP Minnesota submitted to the MPUC its triennial nuclear decommissioning filing. The filing includes a current decommissioning study, which covers all expenses over the estimated lives of the nuclear plants, including decontamination and removal of radioactive material. The estimated future costs are initially determined in nominal amounts prior to escalation adjustments, then future periods costs are escalated using decommissioning specific cost escalators and finally discounted using risk free, credit adjusted interest rates. The following key assumptions have a significant effect on these estimates: Timing Decommissioning cost estimates are impacted by each facilitys retirement date, as well as the expected timing of the actual decommissioning activities. Currently, the estimated retirement dates coincide with each units operating license with the NRC (i.e., 2030 for Monticello and 2033 and 2034 for Prairie Islands Unit 1 and 2, respectively). The estimated timing of the decommissioning activities is based upon a methodology required by the MPUC (i.e., DECON method). By utilizing this method, which assumes prompt removal and dismantlement, these activities are expected to begin at the end of the license date and be completed for both facilities by 2067. Technology and Regulation There is limited experience with actual decommissioning of large nuclear facilities. Changes in technology and experience as well as changes in regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning could cause cost estimates to change significantly. NSP Minnesotas 2011 nuclear decommissioning filing assumes current technology and regulations. Escalation Rates Escalation rates represent projected cost increases over time due to both general inflation and increases in the cost of specific decommissioning activities. NSP Minnesota used an escalation rate of 3.63 percent in calculating the AROs related to nuclear decommissioning for the remaining operational period through the radiological decommissioning period. An escalation rate of 2.63 percent was utilized for the period of operating costs related to interim dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel and site restoration. Discount Rates Changes in timing or estimated expected cash flows that result in upward revisions to the ARO are calculated using the then current credit adjusted risk free interest rate. The credit adjusted risk free rate in effect when the change occurs is used to discount the revised estimate of the incremental expected cash flows of the retirement activity. If the change in timing or estimated expected cash flows results in a downward revision of the asset retirement obligation, the undiscounted revised estimate of expected cash flows is discounted using the credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the date of initial measurement and recognition of the original ARO. The estimated expected cash flows that changed as a result of the 2011 triennial nuclear decommissioning filing resulted in upward revisions to the ARO. As such, the new cost layer was calculated using a 4.33 percent credit adjusted risk free rate. 68 Table of Contents Significant uncertainties exist in estimating the future cost of nuclear decommissioning including the method to be utilized, the ultimate costs to decommission, and the planned method of disposing spent fuel. If different cost estimates, life assumptions or cost escalation rates were utilized, the AROs could change materially. However, changes in estimates have minimal impact on results of operations as we expect to continue to recover all costs in future rates. Xcel Energy continually makes judgments and estimates related to these critical accounting policy areas, based on an evaluation of the varying assumptions and uncertainties for each area. The information and assumptions underlying many of these judgments and estimates will be affected by events beyond the control of Xcel Energy, or otherwise change over time. This may require adjustments to recorded results to better reflect the events and updated information that becomes available. The accompanying financial statements reflect managements best estimates and judgments of the impact of these factors as of Dec. 31, 2011. Derivatives, Risk Management and Market Risk In the normal course of business, Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries are exposed to a variety of market risks. Market risk is the potential loss or gain that may occur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. All financial and commodity related instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market risk. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of market risks associated with derivatives. Xcel Energy is exposed to the impact of changes in price for energy and energy related products, which is partially mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives. In addition to ongoing monitoring and maintaining credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk, when necessary, management takes steps to mitigate changes in credit and concentration risks associated with its derivatives and other contracts, including parental guarantees and requests of collateral. While Xcel Energy expects that the counterparties will perform under the contracts underlying its derivatives, the contracts expose Xcel Energy to some credit and nonperformance risk. Though no material non performance risk currently exists with the counterparties to Xcel Energys commodity derivative contracts, distress in the financial markets may in the future impact that risk to the extent it impacts those counterparties. Distress in the financial markets may also impact the fair value of the debt and equity securities in the nuclear decommissioning fund and master pension trust, as well as Xcel Energys ability to earn a return on short term investments of excess cash. Commodity Price Risk Xcel Energy Inc.s utility subsidiaries are exposed to commodity price risk in their electric and natural gas operations. Commodity price risk is managed by entering into long and short term physical purchase and sales contracts for electric capacity, energy and energy related products and for various fuels used in generation and distribution activities. Commodity price risk is also managed through the use of financial derivative instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows it to manage commodity price risk within each rate regulated operation to the extent such exposure exists. Short Term Wholesale and Commodity Trading Risk Xcel Energy Inc.s utility subsidiaries conduct various short term wholesale and commodity trading activities, including the purchase and sale of electric capacity, energy and energy related instruments. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows management to conduct these activities within guidelines and limitations as approved by its risk management committee, which is made up of management personnel not directly involved in the activities governed by this policy. Changes in the fair value of commodity trading contracts before the impacts of margin sharing mechanisms for the years ended Dec. 31, were as follows: (Thousands of Dollars) 2011 2010 Fair value of commodity trading net contract assets outstanding at Jan. 1 $ 20,249 $ 9,628 Contracts realized or settled during the period (10,672 ) (4,449 ) Unrealized commodity trading transactions during the period 10,847 15,070 Fair value of commodity trading net contract assets outstanding at Dec. 31 $ 20,424 $ 20,249 69 Table of Contents At Dec. 31, 2011, the fair values by source for the commodity trading net asset balance were as follows: Futures / Forwards Maturity Maturity Total Futures/ Source of Less Than Maturity Maturity Greater Than Forwards (Thousands of Dollars) Fair Value 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 4 to 5 Years 5 Years Fair Value NSP Minnesota 1 $ 4,317 $ 14,843 $ $ $ 19,160 PSCo 1 474 790 1,264 $ 4,791 $ 15,633 $ $ $ 20,424 1 Prices actively quoted or based on actively quoted prices. At Dec. 31, 2011, a 10 percent increase in market prices for commodity trading contracts would increase pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.2 million, whereas a 10 percent decrease would decrease pretax income from continuing operations by approximately $0.2 million. Xcel Energys short term wholesale and commodity trading operations measure the outstanding risk exposure to price changes on transactions, contracts and obligations that have been entered into, but not closed, including transactions that are not recorded at fair value, using an industry standard methodology known as Value at Risk (VaR). VaR expresses the potential change in fair value on the outstanding transactions, contracts and obligations over a particular period of time under normal market conditions. The VaRs for the NSP Minnesota and PSCo commodity trading operations, calculated on a consolidated basis using a Monte Carlo simulation with a 95 percent confidence level and a one day holding period, were as follows: Year Ended (Millions of Dollars) Dec. 31 VaR Limit Average High Low 2011 $ 0.09 $ 3.00 $ 0.14 $ 0.33 $ 0.04 2010 0.15 3.00 0.22 0.64 0.03 Interest Rate Risk Xcel Energy is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Xcel Energys risk management policy allows interest rate risk to be managed through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives such as swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. At Dec. 31, 2011, Xcel Energy had unsettled interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional amount of $475 million related to expected 2012 debt issuances. At Dec. 31, 2011, a 100 basis point change in the benchmark rate on Xcel Energys variable rate debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately $2.9 million annually. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries interest rate derivatives. Xcel Energy also maintains a nuclear decommissioning fund, as required by the NRC. The nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to interest rate risk and equity price risk. At Dec. 31, 2011, the fund was invested in a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents, debt securities, equity securities, and other investments. These investments may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. The accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through rates; therefore, fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not have an impact on earnings. Credit Risk Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties nonperformance on their contractual obligations. Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries maintain credit policies intended to minimize overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations. At Dec. 31, 2011, a 10 percent increase in prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $1.3 million, while a decrease of 10 percent in prices would have resulted in an increase in credit exposure of $4.3 million. Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries conduct standard credit reviews for all counterparties. Xcel Energy employs additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate, such as letters of credit, parental guarantees, standardized master netting agreements and termination provisions that allow for offsetting of positive and negative exposures. Credit exposure is monitored and, when necessary, the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided. Distress in the financial markets could increase Xcel Energys credit risk. 70 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements Xcel Energy follows accounting and disclosure guidance on fair value measurements that contains a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value and generally requires that the most observable inputs available be used for fair value measurements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the fair value hierarchy and the amounts of assets and liabilities measured at fair value that have been assigned to Level 3. Commodity Derivatives Xcel Energy continuously monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties to its commodity derivative contracts and assesses each counterpartys ability to perform on the transactions set forth in the contracts. Given this assessment and the typically short duration of these contracts, the impact of discounting commodity derivative assets for counterparty credit risk was not material to the fair value of commodity derivative assets at Dec. 31, 2011. Adjustments to fair value for credit risk of commodity trading instruments are recorded in electric revenues when necessary. Credit risk adjustments for other commodity derivative instruments are deferred as OCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The classification as a regulatory asset or liability is based on commission approved regulatory recovery mechanisms. Xcel Energy also assesses the impact of its own credit risk when determining the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities. The impact of discounting commodity derivative liabilities for credit risk was immaterial to the fair value of commodity derivative liabilities at Dec. 31, 2011. Commodity derivative assets and liabilities assigned to Level 3 consist primarily of FTRs, as well as forwards and options that are either long term in nature or related to commodities and delivery points with limited observability. Level 3 commodity derivative assets and liabilities represent immaterial percentages of total assets and liabilities measured at fair value at Dec. 31, 2011. Determining the fair value of FTRs requires numerous management forecasts that vary in observability, including various forward commodity prices, retail and wholesale demand, generation and resulting transmission system congestion. Given the limited observability of managements forecasts for several of these inputs, these instruments have been assigned a Level 3. Level 3 commodity derivatives assets and liabilities included $13.3 million and $0.9 million of estimated fair values, respectively, for FTRs held at Dec. 31, 2011. Determining the fair value of certain commodity forwards and options can require management to make use of subjective forward price and volatility forecasts for commodities and locations with limited observability, or subjective forecasts which extend to periods beyond those readily observable on active exchanges or quoted by brokers. When less observable forward price and volatility forecasts are significant to determining the value of commodity forwards and options, these instruments are assigned to Level 3. There were no Level 3 commodity forwards or options held at Dec. 31, 2011. Nuclear Decommissioning Fund Nuclear decommissioning fund assets assigned to Level 3 consist of asset backed and mortgage backed securities, private equity investments and real estate investments. To the extent appropriate, observable market inputs are utilized to estimate the fair value of asset backed and mortgage backed securities; however, less observable and subjective inputs are often significant to these valuations, including risk based adjustments to the interest rate used to discount expected future cash flows, which include estimated prepayments of principal. Measurement of private equity investments and real estate investments at net asset value requires significant use of unobservable inputs when determining the fair value of the underlying fund investments, including equity in non publicly traded entities and real estate properties. Therefore, estimated fair values for asset backed and mortgage backed securities, private equity investments and real estate investments totaling $130.8 million in the nuclear decommissioning fund at Dec. 31, 2011 (approximately 9.4 percent of total assets measured at fair value) are assigned to Level 3. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning fund investments are deferred as a regulatory asset. 71 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,406 $ 1,894 $ 1,913 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $512 million for 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase was a result of higher net income, changes in working capital due to timing of payments and the receipt of the nuclear waste disposal settlement of $100 million. These increases were partially offset by a $103 million increase between the periods in pension contributions. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $19 million for 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital partially offset by higher net income and lower pension contributions made in 2010. (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,248 ) $ (2,807 ) $ (1,735 ) Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $559 million for 2011 as compared to 2010. The decrease was mainly due to the acquisition of generation assets in 2010 partially offset by a change in restricted cash due to the receipt of the $100 million nuclear waste disposal settlement. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1.1 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of two natural gas fired generation facilities and increased investment in utility operations primarily at PSCo, including the completion of Comanche Unit 3. (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (205 ) $ 906 $ (322 ) Net cash used in financing activities increased by $1.1 billion during 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and common stock in 2011 and the redemption of preferred stock during 2011. Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $1.2 billion during 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to higher proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and common stock. See discussion of trends, commitments and uncertainties with the potential for future impact on cash flow and liquidity under Capital Sources. 72 Table of Contents Capital Requirements Utility Capital Expenditures The estimated cost of the capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding discontinued operations, and other capital requirements for the years 2012 through 2016 is shown in the tables below. (Millions of Dollars) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 By Subsidiary NSP Minnesota $ 1,130 $ 1,390 $ 1,150 $ 1,040 $ 1,200 PSCo 900 1,020 920 730 720 SPS 460 730 430 320 340 NSP Wisconsin 160 160 200 210 190 Total capital expenditures $ 2,650 $ 3,300 $ 2,700 $ 2,300 $ 2,450 By Function 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Electric transmission $ 710 $ 945 $ 740 $ 660 $ 710 Electric generation 570 680 495 450 345 Electric distribution 445 400 420 460 465 Environmental 300 690 410 190 270 Natural gas 245 275 275 225 245 Nuclear fuel 145 95 160 105 245 Other 235 215 200 210 170 Total capital expenditures $ 2,650 $ 3,300 $ 2,700 $ 2,300 $ 2,450 By Project 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Base and other capital expenditures $ 1,850 $ 1,815 $ 1,690 $ 1,670 $ 2,030 PSCo CACJA 200 410 260 95 10 CapX2020 175 350 285 145 Nuclear fuel 145 95 160 105 245 Nuclear capacity increases and life extension 145 295 105 95 CSAPR (a) 75 255 115 25 RES and infrastructure investments 60 80 85 165 165 Total capital expenditures (b) $ 2,650 $ 3,300 $ 2,700 $ 2,300 $ 2,450 (a) In July 2011, the EPA issued its CSAPR, to address long range transport of particulate matter and ozone by requiring reductions in SO2 and NOx from utilities located in the eastern half of the U.S. On Dec. 30, 2011, the D.C. Circuit issued a stay of the CSAPR, pending completion of judicial review of the rule. Xcel Energy is in the process of determining various scenarios to respond to the CSAPR depending on whether the CSAPR is upheld, reversed, or modified. Capital requirements may vary depending on the final resolution. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of CSAPR. (b) The industry is considering a wide range of strategies to address anticipated NRC regulation. Depending on the approach selected, preliminary estimates range from $20 million to $250 million dollars of capital investment approximately over the next five years to address postulated safety upgrades to the Xcel Energy nuclear facilities. Capital requirements may vary depending on the final regulation, therefore estimated costs are not included in the table above. See Item 1 for further discussion of NRC regulation. The capital expenditure programs of Xcel Energy are subject to continuing review and modification. Actual utility construction expenditures may vary from the estimates due to changes in electric and natural gas projected load growth, regulatory decisions, legislative initiatives, reserve margins, the availability of purchased power, alternative plans for meeting long term energy needs, compliance with future environmental requirements and RPS to install emission control equipment, and merger, acquisition and divestiture opportunities to support corporate strategies. 73 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments In addition to its capital expenditure programs, Xcel Energy has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future. The following is a summarized table of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at Dec. 31, 2011. See the statements of capitalization and additional discussion in Notes 4 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 to 3 4 to 5 After 5 (Thousands of Dollars) Total Year Years Years Years Long term debt, principal and interest payments (a) $ 18,489,722 $ 1,583,410 $ 1,431,936 $ 1,323,435 $ 14,150,941 Capital lease obligations 395,540 18,198 36,007 35,111 306,224 Operating leases (b)(c) 2,984,448 185,690 403,181 397,325 1,998,252 Unconditional purchase obligations 10,585,365 1,866,553 2,519,295 1,875,066 4,324,451 Other long term obligations, including current portion (d) 108,874 28,481 52,244 28,149 Payments to vendors in process 23,363 23,363 Short term debt 219,000 219,000 Total contractual cash obligations (e) (f) (g) (h) $ 32,806,312 $ 3,924,695 $ 4,442,663 $ 3,659,086 $ 20,779,868 (a) Includes interest payments over the terms of the debt. Interest is calculated using the applicable interest rate at Dec. 31, 2011, and outstanding principal for each investment with the terms ending at each instruments maturity. (b) Under some leases, Xcel Energy would have to sell or purchase the property that it leases if it chose to terminate before the scheduled lease expiration date. Most of Xcel Energys railcar, vehicle and equipment and aircraft leases have these terms. At Dec. 31, 2011, the amount that Xcel Energy would have to pay if it chose to terminate these leases was approximately $85.3 million. In addition, at the end of the equipment lease terms, each lease must be extended, equipment purchased for the greater of the fair value or unamortized value of equipment sold to a third party with Xcel Energy making up any deficiency between the sales price and the unamortized value. (c) Included in operating lease payments are $159.0 million, $354.1 million, $355.9 million and $1.9 billion, for the less than 1 year, 1 3 years, 4 5 years and after 5 years categories, respectively, pertaining to PPAs that were accounted for as operating leases. (d) Other long term obligations relate primarily to amounts associated with technology agreements as well as uncertain tax positions. (e) Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries have contracts providing for the purchase and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal, nuclear fuel and natural gas requirements. Additionally, the utility subsidiaries of Xcel Energy Inc. have entered into agreements with utilities and other energy suppliers for purchased power to meet system load and energy requirements, replace generation from company owned units under maintenance and during outages, and meet operating reserve obligations. Certain contractual purchase obligations are adjusted on indices. The effects of price changes are mitigated through cost of energy adjustment mechanisms. (f) Xcel Energy also has outstanding authority under O&M contracts to purchase up to approximately $1.8 billion of goods and services through the year 2050, in addition to the amounts disclosed in this table. (g) In January 2012, contributions of $190.5 million were made across four of Xcel Energys pension plans. (h) Xcel Energy expects to contribute approximately $39.1 million to the postretirement health care plans during 2012. Common Stock Dividends Future dividend levels will be dependent on Xcel Energys results of operations, financial position, cash flows, reinvestment opportunities and other factors, and will be evaluated by the Xcel Energy Inc. Board of Directors. Xcel Energys objective is to continue to grow earnings 5 percent to 7 percent and to grow the dividend 2 percent to 4 percent annually, at least through 2013. Beyond this timeframe, we anticipate that rate base and earnings growth could be moderate. Should this occur, we anticipate having flexibility to increase the dividend at a faster rate in the future. Xcel Energys dividend policy balances: Projected cash generation from utility operations; Projected capital investment in the utility businesses; A reasonable rate of return on shareholder investment; and The impact on Xcel Energys capital structure and credit ratings. In addition, there are certain statutory limitations that could affect dividend levels. Federal law places certain limits on the ability of public utilities within a holding company system to declare dividends. Specifically, under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. The utility subsidiaries dividends may be limited directly or indirectly by state regulatory commissions or bond indenture covenants. Xcel Energy Inc.s Articles of Incorporation place restrictions on the amount of common stock dividends it can pay when preferred stock is outstanding. Xcel Energy Inc. redeemed all outstanding preferred stock in 2011. In addition, Xcel Energy Inc.s Junior Subordinated Indenture places restrictions on its ability to declare and pay dividends in the event Xcel Energy Inc. defers the payment of all or part of the current and accrued interest on its Junior Subordinated Notes due 2068. As of Dec. 31, 2011, Xcel Energy Inc. has paid all current and accrued interest. 74 Table of Contents Regulation of Derivatives In July 2010, financial reform legislation was passed, which provides for the regulation of derivative transactions amongst other provisions. Provisions within the bill provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and SEC with expanded regulatory authority over derivative and swap transactions. Regulations effected under this legislation could preclude or impede some types of over the counter energy commodity transactions and or require clearing through regulated central counterparties, which could negatively impact the market for these transactions or result in extensive margin and fee requirements. Additionally there may be material increased reporting requirements. The bill contains provisions that should exempt certain derivatives end users from much of the clearing and margining requirements. However, the CFTC is still developing the regulatory rules under the act and, it is not clear whether Xcel Energy will qualify for the exemption. In addition, although the CFTCs proposed rules would extend the end user exemption to margin requirements, they would impose a requirement to have credit support agreements in their place. If Xcel Energy does not meet the end user exception, the margin requirements could be significant. The full implications for Xcel Energy can not yet be determined until the various definitions and rulemakings are completed. FERC Order 741 addresses rulemaking addressing the credit policies of organized electric markets and limits the amount of overall credit available to entities operating and places restrictions on netting of transactions within organized markets unless certain market protocols are implemented by the RTO. The various RTOs are in the process of filing their proposed market protocols to satisfy FERC Order 741 and these new market designs may lead to additional margin requirements that could impact our liquidity. Pension Fund Xcel Energys pension assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity securities, shortterm to long duration fixed income securities, and alternative investments, including, private equity, real estate and commodity index investments. In January 2012, contributions of $190.5 million were made across four of Xcel Energys pension plans. In 2011, contributions of $137.3 million were made across three of Xcel Energys pension plans. In 2010, contributions of $34 million were made to the Xcel Energy Pension Plan. For future years, we anticipate contributions will be made as necessary. The funded status and pension assumptions are summarized in the following tables: (Millions of Dollars) Dec. 31, 2011 Dec. 31, 2010 Fair value of pension assets $ 2,670 $ 2,541 Projected pension obligation (a) 3,226 3,030 Funded status $ (556 ) $ (489 ) (a) Excludes non qualified plan of $55 million and $47 million at Dec. 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Pension Assumptions 2012 2011 Discount rate 5.00 % 5.50 % Expected long term rate of return 7.10 7.50 Capital Sources Xcel Energy expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing short term debt, long term debt, common stock and hybrid securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios. Short Term Funding Sources Xcel Energy uses a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs, including operating cash flow, notes payable, commercial paper and bank lines of credit. The amount and timing of short term funding needs depend in large part on financing needs for construction expenditures, working capital and dividend payments. Short Term Investments Xcel Energy Inc., NSP Minnesota, NSP Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS maintain cash operating accounts with Wells Fargo Bank. At Dec. 31, 2011, approximately $6.1 million of cash was held in these liquid operating accounts. Commercial Paper Xcel Energy Inc., NSP Minnesota, NSP Wisconsin, PSCo and SPS each have individual commercial paper programs. NSP Wisconsin received regulatory approval to initiate a commercial paper program beginning in 2011. The authorized levels for these commercial paper programs are: $800 million for Xcel Energy Inc.; $700 million for PSCo; $500 million for NSP Minnesota; $300 million for SPS; and $150 million for NSP Wisconsin. 75 Table of Contents Commercial paper outstanding for Xcel Energy was as follows: Three Months Ended (Amounts in Millions, Except Interest Rates) Dec. 31, 2011 Borrowing limit $ 2,450 Amount outstanding at period end 219 Average amount outstanding 165 Maximum amount outstanding 241 Weighted average interest rate, computed on a daily basis 0.35 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period 0.40 Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (Amounts in Millions, Except Interest Rates) Dec. 31, 2011 Dec. 31, 2010 Dec. 31, 2009 Borrowing limit $ 2,450 $ 2,177 $ 2,177 Amount outstanding at period end 219 466 459 Average amount outstanding 430 263 406 Maximum amount outstanding 824 653 675 Weighted average interest rate, computed on a daily basis 0.36 % 0.36 % 0.95 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period 0.40 0.40 0.36 Commercial paper borrowings during 2011 were used for general operating activities, capital expenditures, redemption of preferred stock and timing differences between debt maturities and refinancings. Credit Facilities During 2011, NSP Minnesota, NSP Wisconsin, PSCo, SPS and Xcel Energy Inc. executed new four year credit agreements. The total capacity of the credit facilities increased approximately $273 million to $2.45 billion. As of Feb. 17, 2012, Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries had the following committed credit facilities available to meet its liquidity needs: (Millions of Dollars) Facility (a) Drawn (b) Available Cash Liquidity Xcel Energy Inc. $ 800.0 $ 244.1 $ 555.9 $ 0.1 $ 556.0 PSCo 700.0 5.0 695.0 44.1 739.1 NSP Minnesota 500.0 7.6 492.4 0.5 492.9 SPS 300.0 300.0 0.8 300.8 NSP Wisconsin 150.0 49.0 101.0 1.1 102.1 Total $ 2,450.0 $ 305.7 $ 2,144.3 $ 46.6 $ 2,190.9 (a) These credit facilities expire March 2015. (b) Includes outstanding commercial paper and letters of credit. Money Pool Xcel Energy received FERC approval to establish a utility money pool arrangement with the utility subsidiaries, subject to receipt of required state regulatory approvals. The utility money pool allows for short term investments in and borrowings between the utility subsidiaries. Xcel Energy Inc. may make investments in the utility subsidiaries at market based interest rates; however, the money pool arrangement does not allow the utility subsidiaries to make investments in Xcel Energy Inc. The money pool balances are eliminated during consolidation. NSP Minnesota, PSCo and SPS participate in the money pool pursuant to approval from their respective state regulatory commissions. NSP Wisconsin does not participate in the money pool. 76 Table of Contents Registration Statements Xcel Energy Inc.s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of one billion shares of $2.50 par value common stock. As of Dec. 31, 2011 and 2010, Xcel Energy Inc. had approximately 486 million shares and 482 million shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. In addition, Xcel Energy Inc.s Articles of Incorporation authorize the issuance of seven million shares of $100 par value preferred stock. Xcel Energy Inc. had no shares of preferred stock outstanding on Dec. 31, 2011 and approximately one million shares of preferred stock outstanding on Dec. 31, 2010. Xcel Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries have the following registration statements on file with the SEC, pursuant to which they may sell, from time to time, securities: Xcel Energy Inc. has an effective automatic shelf registration statement that does not contain a limit on issuance capacity. However, Xcel Energy Inc.s ability to issue securities is limited by authority granted by the Board of Directors, which currently authorizes the issuance of up to an additional $1.75 billion of debt and common equity securities. NSP Minnesota has a shelf registration statement filed in January 2011. NSP Minnesotas ability to issue securities is limited by authority granted by its Board of Directors, which currently authorizes the issuance of up to $1.5 billion of debt securities. PSCo has an automatic shelf registration statement filed in October 2010 that does not contain a limit on issuance capacity. However, PSCos ability to issue securities is limited by authority granted by its Board of Directors, which currently authorizes the issuance of up to $1.15 billion of debt securities. Long Term Borrowings See the consolidated statements of capitalization and a discussion of the long term borrowings in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. During 2011, Xcel Energy Inc. and its utility subsidiaries completed the following financings: In August 2011, PSCo issued $250 million of 30 year first mortgage bonds with a coupon of 4.75 percent. PSCo used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the first mortgage bonds to repay short term debt borrowings incurred to fund daily operational needs. The balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. In August 2011, SPS issued $200 million of 30 year first mortgage bonds with a coupon of 4.5 percent. SPS used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the first mortgage bonds to repay short term debt borrowings incurred to fund daily operational needs and to redeem $57.3 million of the outstanding 5.75 percent pollution control revenue refunding bonds in September 2011. The balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. In September 2011, Xcel Energy Inc. issued $250 million of 30 year unsecured bonds with a coupon of 4.8 percent.
