ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION GENERAL The following is a discussion of the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Certain aspects of the Companys business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Companys results for the year ended December 31, 2001 include the results of Winterthur International with effect from July 1, 2001. The audited financial statements of Winterthur International as at June 30, 2001, on which the final purchase price will be based, are not expected to be completed until later in 2002, at which time any final adjustments will be made. See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Companys results for 2001 also include the effects of terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City, in Washington, D.C. and in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 (collectively, the "September 11 event"). See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 21 Information presented for 1999 is the combination of the results formerly presented by the Company and NAC, as required for a business combination accounted for by the pooling of interests method, which assumes NAC had always been a part of the Company. See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As part of the Companys strategy to expand its life business, the Company assumed a large portfolio of long duration annuity reserves in the fourth quarter of 2001. Life premiums earned are presented separately in the Companys segment results. Life business currently includes life and annuity business that transfers significant mortality and morbidity risks. As a result of the above, period to period comparisons may not be meaningful. This "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" contains forward looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Companys beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. These statements are based upon current plans, estimates and expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. See " Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" for a list of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented under Item 8. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following are considered to be the Companys critical accounting policies due to the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and or the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions or estimates applied for any or all of the accounting policies (either individually or in the aggregate), there could be a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition and liquidity. Other significant accounting policies are nevertheless important to an understanding of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Policies such as those related to revenue recognition, financial instruments and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES Unpaid losses and loss expenses includes reserves for unpaid reported losses and loss expenses and for losses incurred but not reported. The reserve for unpaid reported losses and loss expenses is established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies and consultation with independent legal counsel, and represents the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. The reserve for losses incurred but not reported has been estimated by management and reviewed by independent actuaries, based on loss development patterns determined by reference to the Companys underwriting practices, the policy form, type of insurance program and the experience of the relevant industries. Specifically, several aspects of the Companys casualty insurance operations complicate the actuarial reserving techniques for loss reserves as compared to other companies. These complications include policy forms that differ from more traditional forms, the lack of historical loss data for losses of the type intended to be covered by the policies, and the fact that losses in excess of the attachment level of the Companys policies are characterized by low 22 frequency and high severity, limiting the utility of claims experience of other insurers for similar claims. While management believes the reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are sufficient to cover losses that fall within coverages assumed by the Company, the ultimate claims experience may not be as reliably predicted as may be the case with other insurance operations, and there can be no assurance that ultimate losses and loss expenses will not exceed the total reserves. The methodology of estimating loss reserves is periodically reviewed to ensure that the assumptions made continue to be appropriate and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in income of the year in which the adjustments are made. The establishment of unpaid loss and loss expense reserves also includes reinsurance recoveries. Due to the size of the gross losses arising from the September 11 event and the related reinsurance recoveries and the magnitude of the September 11 event on the reinsurance industry, the Company, in addition to its normal review process, further analyzed the recoverability of these assets. Approximately 96% of the relevant reinsurers currently fall into Standard & Poors financial strength rating categories or equivalent of A or better, with approximately 65% rated AA or better. Accordingly, the Company believes that substantially all insurance will be recoverable. An allowance has been established for estimated uncollectible recoverables. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND WEATHER RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" in June 1998. FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including those embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activity. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Non exchange traded weather products are not covered by FAS 133, however are also recorded at fair value. The Company adopted FAS 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001. The Company conducts activities in three main types of instruments: credit default swap derivatives, weather risk management products and investment related derivative instruments. There was no significant impact from the adoption of FAS 133. See Item 8, Note 14 for further information on these derivative instruments. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS The Company considers credit default swaps to be, in substance, financial guaranty contracts as the Company intends to hold them to maturity. Fair value is determined using a model developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, changes in credit quality and other market factors. The change in fair value in a period is split between premiums, net losses and loss expenses, and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. The change resulting from movements in credit spreads is unrealized as the credit default swaps are not traded to realize this value and is included in net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. Other elements of the change in fair value are based upon pricing established at the inception of the contract. Prior to the adoption of FAS 133, the net premiums earned and loss and loss expenses were included in fee income and other. WEATHER RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS Weather risk management products are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value included in fee income and other. Fair value is determined using a quantitative analytical model developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors including, among others, realized weather results, forecasted weather conditions, changes in interest rates and other market factors. INVESTMENT RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company uses investment derivatives to manage duration and currency exposure for its investment portfolio. None of these investment derivatives are designated hedges, and accordingly, financial futures, options and forward currency contracts are carried at fair value, with the corresponding realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net realized gains and losses on derivative instruments. 23 OTHER THAN TEMPORARY DECLINES IN INVESTMENTS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have sustained an impairment of value that is considered to be other than temporary. The identification of potentially impaired investments involves significant management judgment, which includes the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary. If investments are determined to be impaired, a realized loss is recognized. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty in determining impairment. For other investments that are not quoted, fair value is determined using the financial information received and other economic and market knowledge as appropriate. INCOME TAXES The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon managements estimates of the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities based on current forecasts. A valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. Should the taxable income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance would have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax effected. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are carried at estimated fair value, which is typically less than the value based on undiscounted operating earnings. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying fair value. Other assumptions could produce a significantly different result. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents an after tax analysis of the Companys net income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 2001 2000 1999 Net operating (loss) income (1) ............... $(465,186) $442,932 $370,809 Net realized (losses) gains on investments ....

(2) Average stock options outstanding have been excluded where anti dilutive to earnings per share. Net operating income decreased significantly in 2001 primarily due to net losses arising from the September 11 event. Losses were mainly incurred on the property, aviation, personal accident and business interruption lines. Both the insurance and reinsurance segments were affected by this event. The Companys results for 2001 also 24 include the effects of terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City, in Washington, D.C. and in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 (collectively, the "September 11 event"). While this loss has been provided for, it is managements best estimate at this time and could change significantly as more information becomes available. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is an analysis of the underwriting profit or loss by segment for the year ended December 31, 2001, first including the effects of the September 11 event and then excluding the effect of the September 11 event (U.S. dollars in thousands): YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 EVENT: FINANCIAL LLOYDS PRODUCTS AND GENERAL OPERATIONS: INSURANCE SYNDICATES REINSURANCE SERVICES TOTAL Net premiums earned .......................... $1,222,196 $ 481,307 $1,029,618 $46,806 $ 2,779,927 Fee income and other ......................... 22,065 (3,707) (7,180) 32,286 43,464 Net losses and loss expenses ................. 859,812 610,823 1,428,772 19,491 2,918,898 Acquisition costs ............................ 187,443 155,804 292,069 3,730 639,046 Operating expenses ........................... 178,530 22,215 87,169 42,404 330,318 Exchange losses .............................. 4,924 3,198 4,062 12,184 LIFE OPERATIONS: Life premiums earned ......................... 695,595 695,595 Claims and policy benefit reserves ........... 698,675 698,675 Underwriting profit (loss) ................... $ 13,552 $(314,440) $ (792,714) $13,467 $(1,080,135) Loss and loss expense ratio .................. 70.4% 126.9% 138.8% 41.6% 105.0% Underwriting expense ratio ................... 29.9% 37.0% 36.8% 98.6% 34.9% Combined ratio ............................... 100.3% 163.9% 175.6% 140.2% 139.9% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 EVENT: FINANCIAL LLOYDS PRODUCTS AND GENERAL OPERATIONS: INSURANCE SYNDICATES REINSURANCE SERVICES TOTAL Net premiums earned .......................... $1,226,096 $ 502,707 $1,150,018 $46,806 $ 2,925,627 Fee income and other ......................... 22,065 (3,707) (7,180) 32,286 43,464 Net losses and loss expenses ................. 757,762 395,023 986,622 19,491 2,158,898 Acquisition costs ............................ 187,443 155,804 292,069 3,730 639,046 Operating expenses ........................... 178,530 22,215 87,169 42,404 330,318 Exchange (gains) losses ...................... 4,924 3,198 4,062 12,184 LIFE OPERATIONS: Life premiums earned ......................... 695,595 695,595 Claims and policy benefit reserves ........... 698,675 698,675 Underwriting profit (loss) ................... $ 119,502 $ (77,240) $ (230,164) $13,467 $ (174,435) Loss and loss expense ratio .................. 61.8% 78.6% 85.8% 41.6% 73.8% Underwriting expense ratio ................... 29.8% 35.4% 33.0% 98.6% 33.1% Combined ratio ............................... 91.6% 114.0% 118.8% 140.2% 106.9% 25 In addition, net losses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2001 included adverse prior period loss development on the 1997 through 1999 underwriting years of the reinsurance casualty book, the bankruptcy of Enron Corp. and related matters of approximately $75.0 million, and other large losses including the Sri Lanka airport loss, satellite losses, the Toulouse, France petrochemical plant explosion, the Petrobras oil rig in Brazil and Tropical Storm Allison. The components of these loss events are discussed within each segment. In the year ended December 31, 2000, total losses incurred from all catastrophic events were not as large as those experienced in 2001 or 1999. Net loss in 2001 was also affected by significant amount of investment and derivative losses. This is discussed further under " Investment Activities". Net income increased in 2000 compared to 1999 due to an increase in net investment income, equity in net income of affiliates and exchange gains and losses. This increase was partially offset by an increase in the underwriting loss. In 2000, the Company incurred after tax charges of $124.6 million, or $0.98 per share, which included certain reserve adjustments together with employee severance charges and other costs associated with the realignment of the Companys operations and the discontinuation of certain business lines. These charges affected the underwriting results across the Companys insurance and reinsurance segments. In 1999, the Company incurred losses of $125.0 million after tax, or $0.97 per share, as a result of two major European windstorms in December 1999. In addition, 1999 included an increase to reserves of $95.0 million associated with the merger with NAC. The Company issued 9.2 million common shares on November 7, 2001, which did not significantly dilute the weighted average shares outstanding for 2001. During 2002, the weighted average shares will increase significantly as the 9.2 million shares will be weighted for the full year. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased in 2000 as compared to 1999 due to both an increase in net income and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The decrease in the weighted average number of shares outstanding in 2000 is a result of the Company repurchasing 5.1 million shares during the year. SEGMENTS The Company is organized into three underwriting segments insurance, reinsurance, and financial products and services and a corporate segment, which includes the investment operations of the Company. Lloyds syndicates are included in the insurance segment but are shown separately. See Item 1 and Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. INSURANCE OPERATIONS EXCLUDING LLOYDS SYNDICATES The following table summarizes the underwriting profit for this segment (U.S. dollars in thousands): % CHANGE % CHANGE GENERAL: 2001 01 VS 00 2000 00 VS 99 1999 Net premiums earned ................................ $1,222,196 68.2% $726,506 56.9% $463,069 Fee income and other ............................... 22,065 186.9% 7,692 1.4% 7,584 Losses and loss expenses ........................... 859,812 71.0% 502,898 62.7% 309,079 Acquisition costs .................................. 187,443 60.0% 117,251 79.5% 65,318 Operating expenses ................................. 178,530 90.0% 94,129 32.4% 71,094 Exchange losses (gains) ............................ 4,924 NM (2,344) NM (165) Underwriting profit ................................ $ 13,552 (39.1)% $ 22,264 (12.1)% $ 25,327 Net unrealized gains on credit default swaps ....... $ 14,738 NM NM NM Not Meaningful Effective July 1, 2001, the insurance segment included the results of Winterthur International. Each of the above line items experienced growth primarily as a result of the inclusion of business written and earned by Winterthur International. Consequently, period to period comparisons may not be meaningful. 26 Excluding Winterthur International, net premiums earned increased in the year ended December 31, 2001 over 2000 due to new business written and price increases. This resulted in an increase in net premiums earned from environmental business of $85.0 million, professional lines of $50.0 million and aviation and satellite business of $60.0 million. This was partially offset by decreases in net premiums earned from business discontinued in 2000. Net premiums earned by Winterthur International totaled $353.1 million. Net premiums earned are expected to increase on all lines in 2002 mainly due to the growth in gross premiums written subsequent to September 11 and a full years results of Winterthur International. Growth in net premiums earned in 2000 over 1999 is mainly due to new business, primarily environmental business, written by ECS. ECS contributed approximately $110.0 million in net premiums earned in 2000. No premiums were earned by ECS in 1999 as ECS only commenced writing business on behalf of the Company with effect from January 1, 2000. Prior to this date, ECS had agency agreements in place with other companies. In addition, the Company wrote aviation and satellite business totaling $60.0 million in net premiums earned. In 1999, this business was written on behalf of the Lloyds syndicates, of which the Companys share was approximately $11.5 million in net premiums earned. 2000 also included approximately $25.0 million in net premiums earned of new professional liability business written. Fee income and other for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes $9.1 million related to Winterthur International for the provision of consulting and administration services for employee benefit plans of unrelated companies. In 2000, fee income and other related primarily to the provision of risk management and other consulting services provided by ECS. The decrease in the underwriting profit in each year in this segment is due to higher loss and loss expense ratios as shown below. The following table presents the ratios for this segment for each of the three years ended December 31: 2001 2000 1999 Loss and loss expense ratio ............. 70.4% 69.2% 66.7% Underwriting expense ratio .............. 29.9% 29.1% 29.5% Combined ratio .......................... 100.3% 98.3% 96.2% The loss ratio was higher in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to net losses of $102.0 million incurred related to the September 11 event. This loss was partially offset by favorable loss development from prior accident years. There were no significant catastrophic loss events for this segment in the year ended December 31, 2000. In addition, the 2001 loss ratio increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of losses related to the inclusion of Winterthur International effective July 1, 2001. Business in force at June 30, 2001 for Winterthur International carries a maximum exposure to a combined ratio of 105%. As described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accounting for the purchase of Winterthur International required the Company to fair value the acquired assets and liabilities on June 30, 2001. The fair value adjustment to the loss reserves resulted in an accretion of discount for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $1.4 million. The loss and loss expense ratio in 2000 and 1999 includes the effects of an intercompany stop loss arrangement with a subsidiary in the reinsurance segment. There was no such arrangement in place in 2001. Losses incurred related to this arrangement were $33.5 million and $100.0 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Had this arrangement not been in place, the loss and loss expense ratio would have been 64.6% and 45.2% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in the loss ratio in 2000 over 1999 is due to several factors. In 2000, the Company applied higher loss ratios to certain of its casualty lines written in 2000. These loss ratios have been actuarially estimated and reflect the continued negative impact that competitive market conditions have had on rates for these lines of business written in 2000. There was a reduction of loss reserves in 1999 established on the Companys liability lines due to updated actuarially determined reserve estimates that reflected the favorable development of these lines relating to prior years. Loss reserve adjustments were made in 2000 as discussed previously. Partially offsetting the increases in 2000 were additional reductions in loss reserves related to liability lines written in prior years. 27 The underwriting expense ratio increased slightly in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 2000 due to the reallocation of certain operating expenses from the reinsurance segment to insurance segment and a general expansion of operations. Winterthur International acquisition costs and operating expenses were $47.8 million and $69.8 million, respectively, representing an expense ratio of 33.3%. The expense ratio was reduced by the effect of purchase accounting treatment on the acquisition costs of Winterthur International. Had an historical level of deferred acquisition costs been amortized, the expense ratio for the segment would have been 31.4% in the year ended December 31, 2001. The expense ratio will continue to be affected by this purchase accounting adjustment through the second quarter of 2002. The net decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in 2000 compared to 1999 was mainly due to the significant increase in net premiums earned year over year and, unlike acquisition costs, operational expenses do not change as a direct cost of net premiums earned. Partially offsetting this decrease is the inclusion of expense charges of $13.9 million related to employee severance and other costs in 2000 associated with the realignment of operations and the discontinuation of certain business lines. Excluding these costs, the underwriting expense ratio in 2000 would have been 27.2%. The Company also began to write credit default swaps at primary layers in 2001 in this segment. See Item 8, Note 14(a) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INSURANCE OPERATIONS LLOYDS SYNDICATES The following table summarizes the underwriting results for the Lloyds syndicates (U.S. dollars in thousands): % CHANGE % CHANGE GENERAL: 2001 01 VS 00 2000 00 VS 99 1999 Net premiums earned ........................ $ 481,307 34.5% $357,824 0.6% $355,769 Fee income and other ....................... (3,707) 44.1% (6,626) NM 65,892 Losses and loss expenses ................... 610,823 134.6% 260,372 (12.5)% 297,595 Acquisition costs .......................... 155,804 30.0% 119,870 34.4% 89,195 Operating expenses ......................... 22,215 (22.7)% 28,727 (2.0)% 29,305 Exchange losses (gains) .................... 3,198 NM (5,986) NM (1,180) Underwriting (loss) profit ................. $(314,440) NM $ (51,785) NM $ 6,746 Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased over 2000 primarily as a result of additional syndicate capacity provided by the Company, currently at 63% compared to 53% in the prior year. In addition, net premiums earned increased due to greater premiums written in the prior year than originally estimated. The increase in net premiums earned was partially offset by the net reinstatement premiums of $21.4 million as a result of losses incurred from the September 11 event. In November 2001, the Company realigned its Lloyds operations effective January 1, 2002 and from that time, provides 100% of the capacity for Syndicates 1209 and 990. The Company believes that the expected increase in premiums generated from higher ownership will be reduced by premiums on discontinued lines such as excess of loss treaty, accident and health and certain property accounts. The small increase in net premiums earned in 2000 over 1999 reflected the growth in business written due principally to an increase in syndicate capacity provided by the Company from approximately 43% to 53%. Partially offsetting this increase is the reduction in net premiums earned related to the motor business that was sold effective December 31, 1999. The Company retains the residual liability on this business. In the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, net premiums earned on the motor business were $82.8 million and $135.9 million respectively. In addition, net premiums earned were reduced in 2000 as a result of additional reinsurance costs related to an outwards stop loss reinsurance policy as losses developed for certain lines of business. Coverage provided by this stop loss reinsurance policy was significantly reduced for 2001. 28 Fee income was generated by the Companys Lloyds managing agencies and may, depending upon underwriting results, earn profit commissions from third party capital providers for syndicates they manage. This income was offset by managing agency operating expenses allocated to these capital providers. Although nominal commissions were received in the year ended December 31, 2001, managing agency expenses exceeded fee income and commissions for 2001 and 2000 due to loss deterioration, consistent with the Lloyds market. As a result of the change in capacity as previously noted, less expense will be allocated to the third party capital providers in 2002. In 1999, fee income and other primarily related to the sale of the Companys two motor insurance businesses, resulting in a gain of $40.2 million. In addition, 1999 also included $42.1 million of fees generated from the motor business prior to the sale. No such income was earned in 2001 or 2000. The exchange loss in 2001 was due to the decrease in the U.K. sterling exchange rate against the U.S. dollar applied to net monetary assets denominated in U.K. sterling. Conversely, in 2000 and 1999, the exchange rate moved in the opposite direction. The following table presents the underwriting ratios: 2001 2000 1999 Loss and loss expense ratio ........... 126.9% 72.8% 83.6% Underwriting expense ratio ............ 37.0% 41.5% 33.3% Combined ratio ........................ 163.9% 114.3% 116.9% The loss and loss expense ratio increased in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to net losses incurred for the September 11 event of approximately $215.8 million and other significant losses including the Toulouse petrochemical plant explosion and the airport loss event in Sri Lanka, totaling approximately $19.0 million. In addition, the Company experienced loss deterioration on business written in previous underwriting years of approximately $23.0 million. The underwriting expense ratio was lower in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to savings generated from merging the managing agency operations against a higher net premiums earned base. The decrease in the loss ratio and increase in the expense ratio in 2000 over 1999 primarily reflected the effect of the sale of the motor business. In 1999, the motor business had a loss ratio of approximately 101.1% and an expense ratio of approximately 21.8%. Non motor business written typically has lower loss ratios and higher commissions than the motor business. The increase in the expense ratio in 2000 was also principally due to additional reinsurance costs and a charge of $7.5 million for employee severance and other costs associated with the realignment of the Companys operations.

(7,180) NM (2,197) NM Losses and loss expenses ...................... 1,428,772 115.4% 663,173 (4.2)% 692,269 Acquisition costs ............................. 292,069 18.1% 247,352 10.2% 224,359 Operating expenses ............................ 87,169 (14.7)% 102,132 0.1% 101,978 Exchange losses ............................... 4,062 5.0% 3,868 NM 1,286 LIFE: Life premiums earned .......................... 695,595 NM Claims and policy benefit reserves ............ 698,675 NM Underwriting loss ............................ $ (792,714) NM $ (91,527) 16.8% $(109,977) 29 Underwriting results for the year ended December 31, 2001 were significantly affected by the September 11 event. Net premiums earned in 2001 increased over 2000 due to additional premiums earned in 2001, primarily on property lines, from increased premium rates and new business written. This was partially offset by approximately $120.4 million of net reinstatement premiums resulting from the September 11 event. Net premiums earned are expected to grow in 2002 due to continuing premium rate increases and the consolidation of the results of Le Mans Re, in which the Company increased its ownership to 67% effective January 1, 2002. The increase in net premiums earned in 2000 as compared to 1999 was mainly a result of an increase in net premiums written across most lines of business. In 2000, the Company had experienced some premium rate increases in the other property, marine, aviation and satellite lines of business. Pricing remained generally unchanged in the international property, excluding property catastrophe, and liability lines of business written by the Company. Partially offsetting this increase in net premiums earned was an increase in reinsurance costs incurred in 2000 over 1999, primarily relating to stop loss reinsurance policies where additional premiums became due once losses exceed certain levels. Life premiums earned included $549.3 million related to a large contract consisting of long duration annuity reserves assumed in the fourth quarter of 2001. While the Company expects to write more of these contracts, the frequency of these transactions will likely be irregular. The remaining life premiums earned related to smaller contracts of a similar nature. Fee income and other in 2001 and 2000 related primarily to non underwriting costs for an outward reinsurance contract that did not exist in 1999. The following table presents the underwriting ratios for this segment: 2001 2000 1999 Loss and loss expense ratio .......... 138.8% 71.5% 76.1% Underwriting expense ratio ........... 36.8% 37.7% 35.9% Combined ratio ....................... 175.6% 109.2% 112.0% Property catastrophe business has loss experience that is generally categorized as low frequency but high severity in nature. This may result in volatility in the Companys financial results for any fiscal year or quarter. Property catastrophe losses generally are notified and paid within a short period of time from the covered event. Net losses and loss expenses in 2001 included $442.1 million related to the September 11 event, primarily on the property and aviation reinsurance lines of business. The combined ratio also increased in 2001 over 2000 due to the effects of the reinstatement premium expense noted above. In addition, net losses and loss expenses in 2001 included losses incurred related to continued adverse development in the casualty book of approximately $180.0 million in the 1997 through 1999 accident years. Actuarial assumptions are used to establish initial expected loss ratios employed in the actuarial methodologies from which the reserve for losses and loss expenses is derived. Such loss ratios are periodically adjusted to reflect comparisons with actual claims development, inflation and other considerations. In addition, other large losses in 2001 totaled approximately $93.0 million, including the Sri Lanka airport loss, Tropical Storm Allison, the Petrobras loss in Brazil and the Seattle earthquake. Loss events in 2000, which included an oil refinery loss in Kuwait, several satellite losses and the Singapore Airlines loss, totaled approximately $95.0 million. Barring any significant catastrophes, the Company expects the combined ratio to improve significantly in 2002 due to business anticipated to be written at higher rates and at improved terms and conditions. In 2000 and 1999, net losses and loss expenses incurred in the segment reflected a recovery of $33.5 million and $100.0 million respectively, under an intercompany stop loss arrangement. The loss and loss expense ratio in 2000 and 1999 would have been 75.1% and 87.1% respectively, had this arrangement not been in place. Included in net losses incurred in 2000 are loss reserve adjustments as discussed previously. Excluding the effects of the inter 30 company stop loss agreement, the loss ratio was higher in 1999 compared to 2000 due to a higher amount of catastrophe losses and a reserve adjustment of $95.0 million related to the merger with NAC. Catastrophe losses in 1999 included European windstorms, hailstorms in Sydney, tornadoes in Oklahoma and satellite losses totaling approximately $185.0 million. In addition, there was an increase in the loss ratio in 2000 and 1999 in the casualty reinsurance business related primarily to deterioration in premium rates as described above. The underwriting expense ratio decreased in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses related to certain compensation expenses of approximately $7.0 million accrued in previous years. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily due to lower net earned premiums in 2000 related to the additional stop loss reinsurance costs incurred. Excluding the effect of these costs, the underwriting expense ratio would have been 34.7% and 35.1% for 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Companys casualty business included a minimal element of asbestos and environmental claims on business written prior to 1986. The Companys reserving process includes a supplemental evaluation of claims liabilities from exposure to asbestos and environmental claims, including related loss adjustment expenses. However, the Companys loss and loss expense reserves for such exposures, net of reinsurance, as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is less than 1% of its total reserves. A reconciliation of the Companys gross and net liabilities for such exposures for the three years ending December 31, 2001 is set forth in Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OPERATIONS The following table summarizes the underwriting profit for this segment (U.S. dollars in thousands): % CHANGE % CHANGE GENERAL: 2001 01 VS 00 2000 00 VS 99 1999 Net premiums earned ............................. $ 46,806 97.4% $23,715 11.6% $21,253 Fee income and other ............................ 32,286 102.8% 15,924 (40.9)% 26,924 Losses and loss expenses ........................ 19,491 NM 6,116 14.1% 5,361 Acquisition costs ............................... 3,730 NM 1,323 (37.2)% 2,108 Operating expenses .............................. 42,404 41.5% 29,969 79.8% 16,670 Underwriting profit ............................. $ 13,467 NM $ 2,231 (90.7)% $24,038 Net unrealized losses on credit default swaps ... $(41,552) NM NM Net premiums earned in 2001 increased compared to 2000 due to significantly greater net premiums written in 2001 in the financial guaranty business. This translated into an increase in net premiums earned of approximately $8.8 million as such premiums are earned over a relatively long time period. In 2001, financial guaranty business included primary and secondary municipal portfolios, asset backed securities, structured finance transactions and reinsurance assumed. In 2000, most of the business was treaty business assumed from one financial guaranty company. Net premiums earned in 2001 also included weather related risk management transactions. The increase in net premiums earned in 2001 also included approximately $9.8 million of installment premiums from credit default swaps The increase in fee income for 2001 related to trading gains and the change in the fair value of weather risk management products, reflecting the continued growth in this business. An analysis of the Companys risk management, controls and methodologies is provided within Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk." The vast majority of financial guaranty coverage that is written in swap form pertains to tranches of collateralized debt obligations and asset backed securities, particularly the higher rated tranches with 91% covering A to AAA 31 tranches. As at December 31, 2001, the financial guaranty operations executed credit default swaps with a par insured of $7.9 billion. Since most of the transactions tend to be unique and there is no traded market or any intention to sell such exposures, the Company marks such transactions to market by modeling its exposures and creating indices by using proxies of the spreads on similar categories of exposures. In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, spreads widened considerably causing a mark to market net unrealized loss of $41.6 million, included in net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. Credit downgrades or upgrades are included in the calculation of fair value. The model requires significant judgments to be made by management and is sensitive to changes in market conditions, particularly credit spreads. The following table presents the underwriting ratios for the financial products and services segment: 2001 2000 1999 Loss and loss expense ratio .............. 41.6% 25.8% 25.2% Underwriting expense ratio ............... 98.6% 131.9% 88.4% Combined ratio ........................... 140.2% 157.7% 113.6% The Companys financial guaranty operations write business with an expected loss ratio of approximately 25%. The increase in the loss ratio in 2001 related to a loss on a weather related risk management contract. The corresponding hedge of this contract realized a weather related derivative gain that is recorded in fee income and other. In 2001, there were no credit events that resulted in incurred losses for credit default swaps in this segment. The underwriting expense ratio decreased due to the increase in net premiums earned as a result of the change in presentation noted above. The high expense ratio reflects operating expenses incurred in the generation of fee income and other that is not included in the ratio calculation. In 2002, the Company expects to begin underwriting business owned life insurance and funding agreements as well as issuing municipal guaranteed investment contracts as part of the Companys strategy to expand its life business. INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES The following table illustrates the change in net investment income and net realized gains and losses for each of the three years ended December 31, 2001 (U.S. dollars in thousands): % CHANGE % CHANGE 2001 01 VS 00 2000 00 VS 99 1999 Net investment income ................................ $562,606 3.7% $542,500 3.3% $525,318 Net realized (losses) gains on investments ........... $(93,237) NM $ 45,090 NM $ 66,800 Net realized and unrealized gains on investment derivative instruments(1) ......................... $ 14,638 NM $ 5,481 NM $ 27,556 Annualized effective yield ........................... 5.09% 5.99% 5.85% (1) Excludes unrealized losses from changes in fair value of credit default swaps, discussed in the insurance operations excluding Lloyds syndicates and financial products and services segments. For a summary of realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and weather risk management products, see Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. External investment professionals manage the Companys portfolio under the direction of the Companys management in accordance with detailed investment guidelines provided by the Company. Net investment income increased in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to a higher investment base in 2001. The investment base in 2001 included the receipt of net funds of $1.1 billion related to new debt issued by the Company during the second and third quarters of 2001. As previously noted, the 32 Company also acquired the net assets of Winterthur International from July 1, 2001, increasing the Companys investment assets by $1.4 billion. In addition, in November 2001, the Company issued 9.2 million shares for net proceeds of $787.7 million. The effect of the higher investment base was offset by decreases in the general interest rate levels as a result of the lowering of rates by the Federal Reserve Bank through 2001. Investment income is not expected to increase significantly in 2002 from the increased premium flows, due to payments expected to be made with respect to the September 11 event and to the continued low level of investment rates. See further discussion in " Financial Condition and Liquidity". Assets related to deposit liabilities are included in investments available for sale. Interest earned on deposit liability assets is reduced by the investment expense related to the accretion of deposit liabilities. See further discussion in Item 8, Note 6 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The investment base for 2000 declined as compared to 1999 as a result of claims payments, the repurchase of the Companys shares and the reallocation of assets to other strategic investments. The balance at December 31, 2000 included the reinvestment of investment income and realized gains, and the receipt of assets related to the loss portfolio transfers. These receipts were also offset by the transfer of assets to limited partnerships and affiliate investments. However, investment yields were higher in 2000 compared to 1999, which together with additional income derived from the asset accumulation business, resulted in higher net investment income. Net realized losses on investments in 2001 included losses related to a write down of certain of the Companys fixed income and equity securities available for sale of $66.4 million and certain other investments of $49.1 million, in circumstances where the Company believed there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments. To determine whether an investment has experienced an other than temporary decline, the Company applies the methodology as described in Item 8, Note 2(f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As at December 31, 2001 and 2000, total investments available for sale and cash, net of the payable for investments purchased, were $13.0 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively. Net realized gains in 2000 include a $54.1 million gain on the sale of the Companys investment in FSA Holdings, Inc. However, offsetting this gain, the Company incurred realized capital losses of approximately $66.2 million in certain other investments where the Company determined there to be an other than temporary decline in value of such investments. Net realized investment gains in 1999 reflected the strong performance of the equity market. However, 1999 equity gains were offset by declining fixed income markets. Net realized and unrealized gains on investment derivatives result from the Companys investment strategy to economically hedge against interest and foreign exchange risk within the investment portfolio. See Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk," and " Financial Condition and Liquidity" for a more detailed analysis. OTHER REVENUES AND EXPENSES The following table sets forth other revenues and expenses of the Company for each of the three years ended December 31, 2001 (U.S. dollars in thousands): % CHANGE % CHANGE 2001 01 VS 00 2000 00 VS 99 1999 Equity in net income of investment affiliates ......... $ 80,580 15.1% $ 70,032 59.7% $ 43,865 Equity in net (loss) income of insurance affiliates ... (5,300) NM 4,323 NM (2,958) Other foreign exchange gains .......................... NM 55,159 NM Amortization of intangible assets ..................... 58,569 NM 58,597 19.2% 49,141 Corporate operating expenses .......................... 92,355 49.1% 61,935 (30.4)% 89,037 Interest expense ...................................... 65,350 103.3% 32,147 (14.0)% 37,378 Minority interest ..................................... 2,113 93.3% 1,093 NM 220 Income tax ............................................ (189,914) NM (56,356) 42.4% (39,570) 33 Equity in net income of investment affiliates includes returns from the Companys investments in closed end investment funds. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 and 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily due to increased returns and additional investment in these funds. Equity in net income of insurance affiliates included a loss attributable to the Companys share of the loss in Le Mans Re, mainly related to the September 11 event in 2001, and in Annuity & Life Re. This loss was partially offset by income related to the Companys share of income from FSA International. 1999 included a loss of $3.6 million related to Arch Capital (formerly Risk Capital), which was sold in 2000. Other foreign exchange gains in 2000 related to the revaluation of a deposit liability denominated in U.K. sterling. The exchange rate movement on the assets matching this deposit liability was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as those assets are designated as available for sale, and in net realized gains on sales of investments. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company reorganized its corporate and operational structure for U.K. sterling asset accumulation business such that exchange translation adjustments of this nature were largely matched against corresponding investment portfolio movements with minimal exchange rate effect on net income. Amortization expense did not change significantly in 2001 from 2000. The increase in the amortization of intangible assets in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily related to a full years charge for ECS and XL Specialty acquired in the second quarter of 1999. In 2002, following the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized. The Company has commenced an initial assessment of the effect of the adoption of FAS 142 for goodwill, excluding Winterthur International, and will continue this assessment in accordance with the standard. Amortization expense may decrease in 2002 and future periods, however the assessment of any required impairment charge under the new standard has not yet been completed. See Item 8, Note 2(t) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Corporate operating expenses in 2001 included a charge of $14.0 million related to Winterthur International integration costs. Corporate operating expenses in 2000 included $5.7 million relating to charges for employee severance and other costs relating to the realignment of Companys operations. 1999 included $45.3 million of charges related to the merger with NAC. Excluding these charges, the net increase in corporate operating expenses in each of the years presented is due to the increase in the corporate infrastructure necessary to support the growing worldwide operations of the Company. The increase in interest expense in 2001 over 2000 reflects the effect of $1.1 billion of new debt raised by the Company in the second and third quarters of 2001. The Company raised a further $600.0 million in Guaranteed Senior Notes in January 2002. $350.0 million of the amount raised was used to pay down outstanding revolving credit in February 2002 that would have expired in June 2002. Interest expense is expected to increase in 2002 as a result of a full years charge for this incremental debt. The continuing existence of the debt at existing interest rates is dependent upon the Companys continued compliance with its debt covenants. For further discussion see the Companys financing structure as outlined in " Financial Condition and Liquidity." Decreases in interest expense in 2000 compared to 1999 reflect a reduction in debt carried by the Company through 2000 compared to 1999. The Company extinguished convertible debt assumed in connection with the NAC merger in 1999. In addition, the Company pooled capital with its existing operations as a result of acquisitions in the U.S. in 1999, which facilitated repayment of debt in the third quarter of 1999. This decrease was partially offset by interest expense related to interim borrowings used to finance the repurchase of shares in the year ended December 31, 2000. The change in the Companys income taxes principally reflects the effects of losses arising from the September 11 event and the decline in the profitability of the U.S. operations for each year. Deterioration of the casualty book in 2001, 2000 and 1999 resulted in pre tax net losses for U.S. operations, generating an income tax benefit for both years. The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities and under current projections, the Company anticipates using this asset by 2007. The Companys net deferred tax asset 34 at December 31, 2001 is $419.2 million, which consists principally of net operating losses generated by subsidiaries in the U.S. and U.K. Should the taxable income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance may have to be established which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax effected. See Item 8, Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY As a holding company, the Companys assets consist primarily of its investments in subsidiaries and the Companys future cash flows depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries the Company operates in, including, among others, Bermuda, the United States, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and those of the Society of Lloyds. No assurance can be given that the Company or its subsidiaries will be permitted to pay dividends in the future. The Companys ability to underwrite business is largely dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent agencies. The Company regularly provides financial information to these agencies to both maintain and enhance existing ratings. The Companys shareholders equity at December 31, 2001 was $5.4 billion, of which $2.3 billion was retained earnings. Shareholders equity included the issue of 9.2 million ordinary shares for net proceeds of $787.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 to support capital requirements following the September 11 event. These shares were issued under the Companys $1.5 billion universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in November 2001. Subsequently, this shelf was replaced by a substantially identical shelf. The Companys balance sheet changed significantly since December 31, 2000. The assets and liabilities increased as a result of the purchase of Winterthur International and the effects of the September 11 event. The purchase of Winterthur International increased assets by $4.8 billion and liabilities by $4.6 billion at July 1, 2001. The September 11 event resulted in an increase in loss reserves and reinsurance recoverables of $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The Companys exposure to the September 11 event from Winterthur International is protected through a loss reserve seasoning mechanism. Both loss reserves and reinsurance recoverables increased by $321.0 million. See Item 8, Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes reserves to provide for estimated claims, the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process and for losses incurred but not reported. These reserves are calculated using actuarial and other reserving techniques to project the estimated ultimate net liability for losses and loss expenses. The Companys reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect managements judgment concerning sound financial practice and does not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claims made against the Companys subsidiaries. No assurance can be given that actual claims made and payments related thereto will not be in excess of the amounts reserved. The establishment of unpaid losses and loss expense reserves also includes reinsurance recoveries. Due to the size of the gross losses arising from the September 11 event and the related reinsurance recoveries and the magnitude of the September 11 event on the reinsurance industry, the Company, in addition to its normal review process, further analyzed the recoverability of these assets. Approximately 96% of the relevant reinsurers currently fall into Standard & Poors financial strength rating categories or equivalent of A or better, with approximately 65% rated AA or better. Accordingly, the Company believes that substantially all insurance will be recoverable. An allowance has been established for estimated uncollectible recoverables. See Item 8, Note 10 for further information on the Companys reinsurance. As at December 31, 2001, currency translation adjustments were $37.3 million. This is shown as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and primarily related to unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange rate movements at Winterthur International where some operations have a functional currency that is not the U.S. dollar. 35 Inflation can have an effect on the Company in that inflationary factors can increase damage awards and potentially result in larger claims. The Companys underwriting philosophy is to adjust premiums in response to inflation, although this may not always be possible due to competitive pressure. Inflationary factors are considered in determining the premium level on any multi year policies at the time contracts are written. The Companys liquidity depends on operating, investing and financing cash flows, discussed below. Certain business written by the Company has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Companys results and operational cash flows. Operational cash flows during 2001 improved compared to 2000 primarily due to growth in premiums written, including life premiums. Cash flow has not yet been negatively affected by the September 11 event as the majority of losses are in unpaid loss and loss reserves at December 31, 2001. Settlement of these claims is expected to occur mostly throughout 2002. Due to their nature, recoveries are expected to lag. This cash outflow is expected to be partially offset by an anticipated increased flow of premiums in 2002. The Company has reviewed the anticipated cash flow from the September 11 event and believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations due to the additional capital raised and debt issued in 2001. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, the total amount of net losses paid by the Company was $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and, $1.1 billion respectively. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 is due to growth in operations and the acquisition of Winterthur International. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 is due to an increase in the amount of net premiums written by the Company, together with losses paid for the settlement of previously established reserves, particularly catastrophe losses. The higher amount of paid claims in 2000 compared to 1999 contributed to lower operational cash flow in 2000 as compared to 1999. In 2001, the Company made the following significant investments: (1) On July 25, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of Winterthur International. This was an all cash transaction preliminarily valued at approximately $405.6 million at that date. The preliminary purchase price of the acquisition was based on audited financial statements as at December 31, 2000 for the business acquired, and is subject to adjustment based on the audited June 30, 2001 financial statements of Winterthur International. These audited financial statements are not expected to be completed until later in 2002. The Company does not anticipate any significant income statement impact related to the completion of these audited statements. See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (2) The Company acquired The London Assurance Company of America, Inc., a shell company licensed in forty five U.S. states, for the purpose of obtaining licenses for the financial guaranty operations of the Company. The cost of the acquisition less cash acquired was $16.5 million. (3) The Company invested a further $185.1 million in affiliates, the majority of which related to investment fund affiliates, and a further $109.0 million in limited partnerships and other investments. The Company has had several share repurchase programs in the past as part of its capital management strategy. On January 9, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized a program for the repurchase of shares up to $500.0 million. The repurchase of shares was announced in conjunction with a small dividend increase of $0.04 per share per annum. Under this plan, the Company has purchased 6.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $364.6 million or an average cost of $55.24 per share. The Company has $135.4 million remaining in its share repurchase authorization. As at December 31, 2001, the Company had bank, letter of credit and loan facilities available from a variety of sources, including commercial banks, totaling $4.4 billion of which $1.6 billion in debt was outstanding. In addition, $2.0 billion of letters of credit were outstanding as at December 31, 2001, 5% of which were collateralized by the Companys investment portfolio supporting U.S. non admitted business and the Companys Lloyds capital requirements. 36 During 2001 and 2000, borrowings under these facilities were $1.2 billion and $250.3 million, respectively, and repayments under the facilities were $50.0 million and $211.0 million, respectively. Borrowings in 2001 were used to repurchase $66.4 million of the Companys shares and for general corporate purposes. The borrowings in 2000 were used as interim funding of share buybacks and were repaid using funds from the equity portfolio. The total pre tax interest expense on notes and debt outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $65.4 million and $32.1 million, respectively. Associated with the Companys bank and loan commitments are various loan covenants with which the Company was in compliance throughout the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company amended its facilities following the September 11 event in order to modify certain covenants going forward, although as stated above, the Company was in compliance throughout 2001. These facilities contain various cross default provisions and covenants, including a minimum rating requirement, as further described below under "Cross Defaults and Other Provisions In Debt Documents". In connection with the weather risk management business, the Company issues guaranties to counterparties in most of its transactions. As of December 31, 2001, a majority of the Companys outstanding weather contracts were due to mature on or before December 31, 2002, at which time the Company may terminate any associated guaranties or continue to enter into new transactions which would extend the obligations under such associated guaranties. The following tables present the Companys indebtedness under outstanding securities and lenders commitments as at December 31, 2001 (U.S. dollars in thousands): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD YEAR OF LESS THAN 1 TO 3 4 TO 5 AFTER 6 NOTES PAYABLE AND DEBT COMMITMENT IN USE EXPIRY 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS 364 day revolver ............ $ 500,000 $ 2002 $ $ $ $ 5 year revolver (1) ......... 250,000 250,000 2002 250,000 5 year revolver (1) ......... 100,000 100,000 2002 100,000 7.15% Senior Notes .......... 100,000 99,970 2005 100,000 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes ............. 255,000 255,000 2011 255,000 Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures (2) ........... 609,692 609,692 2021 1,010,833 Liquid Yield Option Notes(TM)2) .............. 290,147 290,147 2021 508,842 Other operating debt ........ 68 68 2002 68 Total $2,104,907 $1,604,877 $350,068 $ $100,000 $1,774,675 (1) These revolvers were repaid in full on February 19, 2002 and have been terminated.

The convertibles may be "put" or converted by the bondholders at various times prior to the 2021 redemption date. The Company may also choose to "call" the debt from May and September 2004 onwards. AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT EXPIRATION PER PERIOD OTHER COMMERCIAL YEAR OF LESS THAN 1 TO 3 4 TO 5 AFTER 6 COMMITMENTS COMMITMENT IN USE EXPIRY 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS Letter of Credit Facilities (1) ... $2,274,000 $2,029,000 2002 $2,274,000 (1) The Company entered into a new secured letter of credit facility in January 2002. The $150.0 million facility is unutilized and will expire at the end of 2002. 37 The Company has several letter of credit facilities provided on a syndicated and bilateral basis from commercial banks and, in the case of the Winterthur International operations, from the previous owner of those operations. These facilities are utilized to support non admitted insurance and reinsurance operations in the U.S. and capital requirements at Lloyds. All of the commercial facilities are scheduled for renewal during 2002, and the Winterthur International arrangement will also terminate during 2002. In addition to letters of credit, the Company has established insurance trusts in the U.S. that provide cedents with statutory relief required under state insurance regulation in the U.S. It is anticipated that the commercial facilities will be renewed on expiry but such renewals are subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by the Company. In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedents. This could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by the Companys investment portfolio or funds withheld using the Companys cash resources. The value of letters of credit required is driven by, among other things, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business. In January 2002, the Company issued $600.0 million par value 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2012 under the Companys universal shelf registration statement referred to above. The Company has approximately $900.0 million remaining in capacity under this shelf registration statement. The issue price was $99.469 with gross proceeds of $596.8 million. The notes were issued through a finance vehicle referred to under "Special Purpose Vehicles and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements" below and were guaranteed by XL Capital Ltd. CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES In 2001, the Company consummated two convertible debt securities as further described below and in the indentures relating to such bonds. These bonds carry a zero coupon, meaning that, under normal circumstances, the Company is not required to pay cash interest at any time during the life of the bonds or at maturity. In May 2001, the Company issued $1,010.8 million principal amount at maturity (subject to adjustment in the event there is an upward interest adjustment) of Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures ("CARZ") at $593.57 per bond and, unless converted or repaid before their due date of May 2021, they will be repaid in May 2021 at $1,000 per bond, at a total cost of $1.01 billion. The accretion rate is 2.625% per annum on a semi annual basis or 2.6422% per annum on an annual basis. In September 2001, the Company also issued $508.8 million principal amount at maturity (subject to adjustment in the event there is an upward interest adjustment) of Liquid Yield Option Notes(TM) ("LYONs") at an initial price of $565.01 per bond. The LYONs will also be repaid at $1,000 each, unless converted or repaid before their due date of September 2021, at a total cost of $508.8 million. The accretion rate on the LYONs is 2.875% per annum on a semi annual basis or 2.89566% per annum on an annual basis. Although both the CARZ and LYONs are due to be repaid in 2021, there are several features that may result in the bonds being repaid or converted into the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares before the redemption date. As these features include market driven features and options available to the Company and bondholders, it is not possible to determine if the bonds will remain outstanding until their scheduled maturity in 2021. Each of the CARZ and LYONs provide the bondholders the right to require the Company to repurchase the bonds on predetermined dates ("put" dates) at predetermined values as set forth in the relevant indenture. The put dates for the CARZ occur on May 23 of 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2016. The put dates for the LYONs occur on September 7 of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2016. The Company may, at its option, pay the repurchase price in cash or Class A ordinary shares or a combination thereof. In addition, each of the CARZ and LYONs provide for a contingent conversion feature that gives the bondholders the right to convert the bonds into the Companys shares at other times during the life of the bonds should the market price of the Companys shares trade at certain levels. Accordingly, if the Companys share price is at least 110% of the accreted conversion price for at least twenty of the thirty days during the relevant conversion period, the bondholders would have the right to convert the bonds into Class A Ordinary Shares. If converted for shares, each CARZ would be converted into 5.9467 shares and each holder of a LYONs would receive 5.277 shares. The 38 accreted values would be determined by applying the accretion rate to the initial issue price. In the example of CARZ, the accreted price on May 23, 2002 will be $609.25 determined by adding one years accretion of 2.6422% per annum on an annual basis to the original issue price of $593.57. The holders of each of the CARZ and LYONs also have the right to convert the bonds for shares in the event that the trading price of the bonds for a predetermined period falls below 95% of the value of the equivalent number of shares, provided however, if the shares are trading at a predetermined premium to the accreted price of the bonds, holders may receive cash, shares or a combination thereof in lieu of shares upon conversion. These bonds also provide for interest rates to be adjusted in the event that the Companys stock price falls below levels specified in the relevant indenture relative to the conversion price. In addition, in the event that the credit ratings assigned to the bonds by Standard & Poors fall below the specified level of BBB+, the bonds would be convertible into shares at 5.9467 shares per CARZ and 5.277 per LYON. The rating assigned to the bonds at the time of issue was A+. Some corporate transactions, such as a change of control of the Company, would give the bondholders the right to require the Company to repurchase the bonds at the accreted value of the bonds at that time. The bonds become immediately due if an event of default occurs and 25% or more of the bondholders demand repayment of the accreted value at the time of such event. Such an event of default would include failure to pay amounts due on the notes, an event of default occurring under the Companys other credit facilities, or certain other events such as bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. A further description of the events of default are contained in the indentures and consequences to the Company are described under "Cross Default and Other Provisions in Debt Documents". The bonds are also callable as the Company has the right to redeem the bonds for cash, in full or in part, at their accreted value at any time after May 23, 2004, in the case of the CARZ, and September 7, 2004, in the case of the LYONs. The puts and the interest rate adjustment features embedded in the CARZ and LYONs are considered derivatives and are subject to fair value. There is currently minimal value ascribed to the puts, as the contingent events of these features are considered unlikely to occur or to the interest rate adjustment feature due to the current trading value of the bonds. Due to the contingent nature of the conversion features of these debt securities, there is no impact on fully diluted earnings (loss) per share at this time. CROSS DEFAULT AND OTHER PROVISIONS IN DEBT DOCUMENTS The following describes certain terms of the documents referred to below. All documents referred to below have been filed with the SEC and should be referred to for an assessment of the complete contractual obligations of the Company. In general, all of the Companys bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Companys outstanding indebtedness (collectively, the "Companys Debt Documents"), as described above, contain cross default provisions to each other and the Companys Debt Documents (other than the LYONs, CARZ and 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures) contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, among other things, minimum required ratings of the Companys insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries (other than its AAA financial guaranty companies) and the level of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generally each of the Companys Debt Documents provide for an event of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or some events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. The Companys credit facilities and the 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes also contain minimum consolidated net worth covenants. Under the Companys 364 day facility, five year credit facilities and ten year private placement notes described above, in the event that the Company fails to maintain a claims paying rating of at least A from A.M. Best or the Companys insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries (other than its AAA financial guaranty companies) fail to maintain a rating of at least A from S&P, an event of default would occur. 39 Each of the LYONs, CARZ and 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures contains a cross default provision. In general, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $50.0 million or more, an event of default would be triggered under both the LYONs and 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures. Under the CARZ indenture, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $100 million or more, an event of default would be triggered. Given that all of the Companys Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due and payable and an acceleration of all debt due under those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness. In addition, the Companys unsecured Lloyds letter of credit facility provides that, in the event that the Companys insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries fall below A (as generally measured by the lower of the financial strength rating from A.M. Best or S&P at any time), the facility would then be required to be fully secured by the Company, at which time the Company would be required to either (i) provide an amount in cash to cover an amount equal to the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time or (ii) deposit assets in trust securing 105% of the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time. If this were to occur, the Company may not be able to provide the collateral required in order to maintain this facility. SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES AND OTHER OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company utilizes special purpose vehicles to a limited extent both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of the Companys business. At the transactional level, the Company provides various forms of credit enhancement including financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance of structured transactions backed by pools of assets of specified types, municipal obligations supported by the issuers ability to charge fees for specified services or projects, and corporate risk based obligations including essential infrastructure projects and obligations backed by receivables from future sales of commodities and other specified services. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized through off balance sheet vehicles. In synthetic transactions, the Company guarantees payment obligations of counterparties, including special purpose vehicles, under credit default swaps referencing asset portfolios. The Company only provides financial guaranty insurance, or indirectly reinsurance, of these vehicles for fixed premiums at market rates but does not hold any equity positions or subordinated debt in these off balance sheet arrangements. Accordingly, these vehicles are not consolidated. The Company has a 38% direct investment in an asset backed commercial paper company that invests funds provided through a commercial paper and a Euro Medium Term Note program. The assets of this company are guaranteed by an unrelated third party. The Company has a further indirect investment that does not provide any additional control. The Company accounts for this investment on an equity basis. The Company has loaned a $30.0 million note to this investment company. The investment company has assets and liabilities of $950.0 million at December 31, 2001 and generated income net of start up costs totaling $1.2 million. The Company believes its investment in this company and note receivable are realizable The Company created XL Capital Finance (Europe) plc to facilitate the January 2002 issue of 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes referred to above. This finance vehicle is wholly owned and controlled by the Company and, therefore, will be consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, Note 2(t) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements. CURRENT OUTLOOK Prior to the September 11 event, premium rates in 2001 across the majority of the Companys property and casualty lines of business had begun to increase after several years of intense competition. Since the September 11 event, the largest ever man made insured loss in recent history, premium rates, terms and conditions have significantly improved. The favorable changes have also had the effect of attracting new entrants to the industry, which to 40 date has only affected the Company to a limited extent. The Company believes that, given its global presence with the acquisition of Winterthur International, it is well positioned to participate in a strong recovery in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to potential loss from various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity values, as it relates to the Companys participation in the weather risk management market. The Company manages its market risks based on guidelines established by senior management. The Company enters into derivatives and other financial instruments for trading and risk management purposes. These derivative instruments are carried at fair market value with the resulting gains and losses recognized in income in the period in which they occur. This risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and value at risk ("VaR") analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See generally "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements." COMMODITY RISK The Company offers weather risk management products in insurance or derivative form to end users, while hedging the risks in the over the counter and exchange traded derivatives markets. In addition to entering into transactions with end users, the Company also maintains a weather derivatives trading portfolio. As of the year ended December 31, 2001, a majority of the Companys outstanding weather contracts were due to mature on or before December 31, 2002. The fair values of these transactions are determined using quantitative analysis. The models used to determine these fair values are consistent with the models used to estimate the Companys VaR exposure to weather risk. MARKET RISK Market risk for the Companys commodity portfolio relates to changes in underlying weather conditions (i.e., changes in climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation). The Company has underwritten risks in Asia, Europe, and North America, with its primary market risk related to temperature changes within the United States. The Company manages its weather portfolio by employing a variety of strategies. These strategies include geographical and directional diversification of risk exposures, direct hedging within the capital markets, and reinsurance. Portfolio risk management is undertaken on a Company wide basis, rather than on an individual product basis, to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well diversified and which remains within the aggregate risk tolerance as established by the Companys senior management. VALUE AT RISK A statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools used by management to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of the Companys weather risk portfolio. VaR, as it relates to commodity risk, is calculated on a daily basis by the Companys risk management professionals and distributed daily to the appropriate members of management. The Company estimates VaR based on the historical simulation of each of the seasonal books into which weather transactions are segregated. The Companys high, low and average aggregate seasonal VaR amounts during 2001 were $48.6 million, $4.7 million and $30.1 million, respectively, calculated at a 99% confidence level. The Company calculates its aggregate VaR by summing the VaR amounts for each of its seasonal portfolio. Since VaR statistics are estimates based on historical position and market data, VaR should not be viewed as an absolute, predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for the Company to predict risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual future losses will not exceed its VaR amounts. 41 CREDIT RISK The Company is exposed to credit risk, or the risk that counterparties to weather transactions will fail to perform their contractual payment or other obligations leading to possible losses. In order to control its risk exposures, the Company has implemented a credit risk control framework centered on a management credit committee, credit policies and credit limits. All credit sensitive transactions are reviewed and approved by the Companys risk management personnel and or management credit committee and exposures are accommodated under authorized credit limits before the Company enters into weather derivative transactions. To address counterparty risk concerns and to support credit exposures in certain cases, the Company may require counterparties to provide a guaranty or a letter of credit or to post margin or collateral. The Company monitors its credit exposures on a continual basis to ensure adherence to all policies and limits.

(2,369) 1,226 (1,443) Total fair value of contracts outstanding ............. $(2,330) $1,226 $ $ $(1,104) The Company seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures its market, credit, operational and legal risks. The Companys senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed and implemented policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. Due to the changing nature of the global marketplace, the Companys risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are evolving and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Market, credit, operational, legal and other risks are inherent in the Companys weather risk management business and cannot be wholly eliminated or reduced despite the Companys risk management policies, procedures and methodologies, which are subject to limitations and assumptions. Beginning in 2002, the Company anticipates entering the energy risk management market, particularly in respect of natural gas and electricity, and applying methodologies for determining fair value and VaR generally consistent with those used in relation to its weather based business. OPERATIONAL RISK Operational risk refers generally to the risk of loss resulting from the Companys weather risk trading operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in the Companys operating systems, and inadequacies or breaches in the Companys control procedures and processes. The Company relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process its transactions, because weather transactions may cross multiple markets and involve different currencies. In the event of a breakdown or 42 improper operation of systems or improper action by employees, the Company could suffer, among other things, financial loss, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage or other material adverse consequences. In order to mitigate and control operational risk, the Company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, the Companys weather risk management business has implemented procedures that require that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected in the Companys books and records and are confirmed with counterparties at least annually. Critical systems are backed up on a daily basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The Company also uses periodic self assessments and internal audit reviews as a further check on operational risk. Moreover, trading position valuations are subject to periodic independent review and audit. LEGAL RISK Legal risk, generally, is the risk that a derivative transaction will not be properly documented. Proper documentation is critical to assure not only that a counterparty has the authority to enter into the transaction, but also that derivative transactions are enforceable as negotiated between parties and excluded from preferential transfer provisions in the event of counterparty insolvency. As a result, the Company obtains an executed International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. ("ISDA") Master Agreement or a form of confirmation which incorporates by reference the ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule. The ISDA Master Agreement Schedule adopted and periodically enhanced by the Company incorporates, among other provisions, the following contractual protections: the netting of transactions between the Company and the counterparty; a right of set off for the Company; a representations and warranties provision; and a customized event of default and termination section (typically based upon credit ratings downgrades identified by the Companys risk management department). Further, legal documentation may be required when the Company enters into a weather derivative transaction with a non U.S. counterparty. The Company anticipates that further regulation of weather and energy derivative contracts is reasonably likely to occur based upon recent events and failures in the energy market. Based upon the evolving regulatory developments in energy trading, the Company will continue to monitor and enhance its credit, operational and legal procedures and processes to comply with future regulation. INVESTMENT MARKET RISK The Companys investment portfolio consists of fixed income and equity securities, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings will be affected by, among other things, changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. External investment professionals manage the Companys portfolio under the direction of the Companys management in accordance with detailed investment guidelines provided by the Company. These guidelines encompass investments in derivatives. Derivatives can only be utilized for purposes of managing interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk, provided the use of such instruments are incorporated in the overall portfolio duration, spread, convexity and other relevant portfolio metrics. The use of derivatives is not permitted to economically leverage the portfolio outside of the stated guidelines. VALUE AT RISK VaR is one of the tools used by management to measure potential losses in fair values using historical rates, market movements, credit spreads and default rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these factors to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability. The VaR of the investment portfolio and all investment related derivatives at December 31, 2001 was approximately $351.0 million and $18.0 million, respectively. VAR METHODOLOGY, ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS The Companys investment VaR is computed by an affiliate that uses a technique called "Monte Carlo simulation." The Monte Carlo simulation projects thousands of possible different prices of equity securities, fixed income 43 securities, derivatives and currencies, taking into account the volatility of each security and the historical correlation between security price changes in a one month forecast horizon. VaR is calculated based on a 95% confidence level and the result is presented as an absolute VaR. INTEREST RATE AND EQUITY PRICE RISK An immediate 100 basis point adverse shift in the treasury yield curve would result in a decrease in total return of 5.0% or $542.0 million on the Companys fixed income portfolio as of December 31, 2001. In evaluating the impact of price changes of the equity portfolio, a 10% change in equity prices would affect total return by approximately $55.0 million at December 31, 2001. The Company has short term debt and long term debt outstanding. Interest rates on short term debt are LIBOR based. Accordingly, any changes in interest rates will affect interest expense. The Company also uses derivative investments to add value to the investment portfolio where market inefficiencies are believed to exist, to equitize cash holdings of equity managers and to adjust the duration of a portfolio of fixed income securities to match the duration of related deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2001, bond and stock index futures outstanding were $695.6 million with underlying investments having a market value of $9.7 billion. Losses of $1.0 million were realized on these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2001. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of these derivative instruments would have resulted in realized gains and realized losses of $82.4 million, respectively. The Company reduces its exposure to these futures through offsetting transactions, including options and forwards. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the effects of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of certain of its foreign currency fixed maturities and equity investments. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purposes and therefore, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. These contracts generally have maturities of three months or less. In addition, where the Companys investment managers believe potential gains exist in a particular currency, a forward contract may not be entered into. At December 31, 2001, forward foreign exchange contracts with notional principal amounts totaling $45.6 million were outstanding. The fair value of these contracts as at December 31, 2001 was $45.7 million with unrealized gains of $0.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2001, realized gains of $5.3 million and unrealized gains of $2.3 million were recorded in net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. Based on this value, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of other currencies under contract at December 31, 2001 would have resulted in approximately $23.5 million of unrealized losses and $18.4 million in unrealized gains, respectively. CREDIT RISK The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the other parties to the forward contracts, however the Company does not anticipate non performance. The difference between the notional principal amounts and the associated market value is the Companys maximum credit exposure. EMBEDDED DEBT DERIVATIVES The puts and the interest rate adjustment features embedded in the CARZ and LYONs are considered derivatives and are subject to fair value. There is currently minimal fair value ascribed to (i) the puts, as the contingent events of these features are considered unlikely to occur or (ii) the interest rate adjustment feature due to the current trading value of the bonds. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA") provides a "safe harbor" for forward looking statements. Any prospectus, prospectus supplement, the Companys Annual Report to Shareholders, any proxy state 44 ment, any other Form 10 K, Form 10 Q or Form 8 K of the Company or any other written or oral statements made by or on behalf of the Company may include forward looking statements which reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Such statements include forward looking statements both with respect to the Company in general, and the insurance, reinsurance and financial products and services sectors in particular (both as to underwriting and investment matters). Statements which include the words "expect", "intend", "plan", "believe", "project", "anticipate", "will", and similar statements of a future or forward looking nature identify forward looking statements for purposes of the PSLRA or otherwise. All forward looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. The Company believes that these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions may not be as large or significant as the Company is currently projecting; (ii) the size of the Companys claims may change due to the preliminary nature of reports and estimates of loss and damage, particularly in relation to the attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001; (iii) the timely and full recoverability of reinsurance placed by the Company with third parties; (iv) the projected amount of ceded reinsurance recoverables and the ratings and creditworthiness of reinsurers may change; (v) the timing of claims payments being faster or the receipt of reinsurance recoverables being slower than anticipated by the Company; (vi) ineffectiveness or obsolescence of the Companys business strategy due to changes in current or future market conditions; (vii) increased competition on the basis of pricing, capacity, coverage terms or other factors; (viii) greater frequency or severity of claims and loss activity, including as a result of natural or man made catastrophic events, than the Companys underwriting, reserving or investment practices anticipate based on historical experience or industry data; (ix) developments in the worlds financial and capital markets which adversely affect the performance of the Companys investments and the Companys access to such markets; (x) the potential impact of U.S. solutions to make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism; (xi) developments in the Enron Corp. bankruptcy proceedings or other developments related to Enron Corp. insofar as they affect property and casualty insurance and reinsurance coverages; (xii) availability of borrowings and letters of credit under the Companys credit facilities; (xiii) changes in regulation or tax laws applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, brokers or customers; (xiv) acceptance of the Companys products and services, including new products and services; (xv) changes in the availability, cost or quality of reinsurance; (xvi) changes in the distribution or placement of risks due to increased consolidation of insurance and reinsurance brokers; (xvii) loss of key personnel; (xviii) the effects of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including, without limitation, the Winterthur International acquisition; (xix) changes in rating agency policies or practices; (xx) changes in accounting policies or practices; (xxi) legislative or regulatory developments; (xxii) changes in general economic conditions, including inflation, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors; (xxiii) the effects of business disruption or economic contraction due to terrorism or other hostilities; and (xxiv) the other factors set forth in the Companys other documents on file with the SEC. The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein or elsewhere. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
