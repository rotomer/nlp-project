ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General The following is a discussion of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Certain aspects of the Companys business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Companys results of operations and financial condition. The Companys results for all periods subsequent to July 1, 2001 include the results of Winterthur International. See Critical Accounting Policies and Item 8, Note 6 (c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for futher information. The Companys results for 2002 and 2001 also include the effects of terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City, in Washington, D.C. and in Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001 (collectively, the September 11 event). This should be considered when making period to period comparisons. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Companys beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. These statements are based upon current plans, estimates and expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements for a list of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented under Item 8. Critical Accounting Policies The following are considered to be the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates due to the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and or the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions or estimates applied for any or all of the accounting policies (either individually or in the aggregate), there could be a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies have been discussed by management with the Companys Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Other significant accounting policies are nevertheless important to an understanding of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Policies such as those related to revenue recognition, financial instruments and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 1) Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses and Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses Recoverable Unpaid losses and loss expenses includes reserves for unpaid reported losses and loss expenses and for losses incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). The reserve for unpaid reported losses and loss expenses for the Companys general operations is established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies and consultation with legal counsel, and represents the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among the Companys operations. 31 With respect to the Companys insurance operations, the Company is notified of insured losses and claims personnel record a case reserve for the estimated amount of the settlement, if any. The estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. In the Companys Lloyds operations within the insurance segment, where the Company is not a lead underwriter, claim reserves are established based upon notifications from a central market bureau. With respect to the Companys reinsurance general operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. With respect to the Companys financial products and services general operations, financial guaranty claims written on an insurance basis are established consistent with the Companys insurance operations and financial guaranty claims written on a reinsurance basis are established consistent with the Companys reinsurance operations. At December 31, 2002, the Companys total gross reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses was $13.2 billion, of which $7.7 billion related to reserves for reported claims and $5.5 billion for IBNR reserves. Most of the Companys IBNR loss reserves are established with respect to its insurance and reinsurance casualty business. Casualty business generally has a longer tail (meaning a longer period of time between receipt of the premium and the ultimate settlement of the claim) than the Companys other lines of business. IBNR reserves are calculated by the Companys actuaries using several standard actuarial methodologies including paid and incurred loss development, the Bornhuetter Ferguson incurred loss method and frequency and severity approaches. Loss and loss expenses are charged to income as they are incurred. This includes loss and loss expense payments and any changes in reported and IBNR reserves. During the loss settlement period, additional facts regarding claims are reported. As these additional facts are reported, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the unpaid losses and loss expense reserves. The actual final liability may be significantly different than prior estimates. Claims relating to property catastrophe and property risk excess treaties are generally reported within approximately twenty four months from the date of occurrence. The Companys net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves broken down by operating segment at December 31, 2002 was as follows: (U.S. dollars in millions) Insurance $4,771 Reinsurance 3,588 Financial products and services 36 Net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves $8,395 32 The following table shows the net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the Company at December 31, 2002 by line of business: (U.S. dollars in millions) Casualty insurance $3,169 Casualty reinsurance 1,611 Property insurance 903 Property catastrophe reinsurance 257 Other property reinsurance 658 Marine and aviation reinsurance and insurance 996 Other (1) 801 Total $8,395 (1) Consists of several products, including accident and health, financial guarantee, political risk, surety and bonding. The total net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves includes both reported and IBNR reserves. IBNR reserves are calculated by the Companys actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies as discussed above. The outcomes of the Companys actuarial reviews, consistent with historical practice, will either provide (i) a single point estimate that is managements best estimate or (ii) a range of reserve estimates. The Company considers a best estimate to be one that has an equal likelihood of developing a redundancy or deficiency as the loss experience matures. For the majority of the Companys actuarial reviews, a single point reserve representing managements best estimate is recorded. The Companys actuaries utilize one set of assumptions in determining its single point estimate. These assumptions include loss development factors, loss ratios, reported claim frequency and severity. These reviews and documentation are completed in accordance with professional actuarial standards appropriate to the jurisdictions where the business is written. The selected assumptions reflect the actuarys judgment based on historical data and experience. In all other instances, a range of reserve estimates is calculated. At December 31, 2002, in those instances in which a range was calculated, the Companys loss reserve estimates were at the mid point of those ranges. The following table shows the recorded estimate and the high and low ends of the range of reserves for each of the lines of business noted above for which a range of estimates was provided at December 31, 2002, as well as the recorded estimate of reserves for those lines of business for which a point estimate was established: (U.S. dollars in millions) Recorded High Low Casualty insurance $1,125 $1,223 $1,027 Property insurance 140 150 130 Property catastrophe reinsurance 218 235 201 Other property reinsurance 234 254 214 Marine and aviation reinsurance and insurance 110 121 99 Other 216 256 176 Total utilizing range estimates $2,043 Lines utilizing single point estimates $6,352 Total $8,395 33 As at December 31, 2002, the Companys total net unpaid loss and loss expense reserve was the sum of the single point estimates and the mid point of the range for those lines in which a range was provided. The Company does not have a range for its total net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves. Moreover, it would not be appropriate to add the ranges for each line of business to obtain a range around the Companys total reserves because this would not reflect the diversification effects across the Companys various lines of business. The diversification effects result from the fact that losses across the Companys different lines of business are not completely correlated. Certain aspects of the Companys casualty operations complicate the actuarial process for establishing reserves. Casualty business written by the Companys insurance operations is high layer excess casualty business, meaning that the Companys liability is after large deductibles including self insurance or insurance from sources other than the Company. The Company commenced writing this type of business in 1986 and issued policies in forms that were different from traditional policies used by the industry at that time. Initially, there was a lack of industry data available for this type of business. Consequently, the basis for establishing loss reserves by the Company for this type of business was largely judgmental and based upon the Companys own reported loss experience which was used as basis for determining ultimate losses, and therefore IBNR reserves. Over time, the amount of available historical loss experience data of the Company has increased. As a result, the Company has obtained a larger statistical base to assist in establishing reserves for these excess casualty insurance claims. Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications to the reserving process in that there is an inherent lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event from an insured or ceding company to the reinsurer. This reporting lag creates an even longer period of time between the policy inception and when a claim is finally settled. This period can be as long as thirty years for casualty reinsurance business written. As a result, more judgment is used to establish reserves for ultimate claims in the Companys reinsurance operations. See further discussion within the Companys operating segments for prior year development of loss reserves. The Companys three types of reserve exposure with the longest tails are: (1) high layer excess casualty insurance; (2) casualty reinsurance; and (3) discontinued asbestos and long tail environmental business. High layer excess casualty claims typically involve claims relating to (i) a shock loss such as an explosion or transportation accident causing severe damage to persons and or property over a short period of time, (ii) a non shock loss where a large number of claimants are exposed to injurious conditions over a longer period of time, such as exposure to chemicals or pharmaceuticals or (iii) a professional liability loss. In each case, these claims are ultimately settled following extensive negotiations and legal proceedings. This process can typically take 5 to 15 years following the date of loss. Set forth below is information regarding the numbers and amounts of claims for high layer excess casualty insurance for December 31, 1999 through December 31, 2002: Number of claims reported as of December 31, 1999 80 Number of claims reported during 2000 24 Number of claims reported during 2001 19 Number of claims reported during 2002 22 Number of claims reported as of December 31, 2002 145 34 (U.S. dollars in millions) Cumulative claims paid as of December 31, 1999 $ 1,711 Amount of claims paid during 2000 $ 475 Cumulative claims paid as of December 31, 2000 $ 2,186 Amount of claims paid during 2001 $ 126 Cumulative claims paid as of December 31, 2001 $ 2,312 Amount of claims paid during 2002 $ 539 Cumulative claims paid as of December 31, 2002 $ 2,851 As at December 31, 2002, the Companys reported claims for its high layer excess casualty business were 32 shock losses, 50 non shock losses and 63 professional liability losses. With respect to casualty reinsurance, the reserving methods generally include historical aggregated claim information as reported by ceding companies, combined with the results of claims and underwriting reviews of a sample of the ceding companys claims and underwriting files. Therefore, detailed claim information for this line of business is not available. With respect to discontinued asbestos and long tail environment business, see Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This business had been previously written by NAC prior to its acquisition by the Company. Except for certain workers compensation and long term disability liabilities, the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving for workers compensation and long term disability unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable, and discounts such losses using an interest rate of 7%. The interest rate approximates the average yield to maturity on specific fixed income investments that support these liabilities. A 1% reduction in the interest rate would increase unpaid loss and loss expense reserves and net incurred loss and loss expenses by approximately $22.0 million based on the current estimated amount and payout of the liabilities. See Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The establishment of unpaid loss and loss expense reserves also includes the estimation of related reinsurance recoverables. Due to the size of the gross losses arising from the September 11 event and the effect on the reinsurance industry, the Company, in addition to its normal review process, further analyzed the recoverability of these assets. In addition to the potential effect of the non recoverability of these assets from reinsurers disputing claims, the reinsurance market in general has experienced significant capital erosion as a result of underwriting and investment losses. Accordingly, there is greater uncertainty regarding recoverability due to the reinsurers ability to pay. See Financial Condition and Liquidity and Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 2) Future Policy Benefit Reserves Future policy benefit reserves relate to the Companys life operations and are estimated using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, expenses and provisions for adverse loss deviation. Uncertainties such as interest rate volatility and the accuracy of mortality tables make it difficult to estimate the ultimate benefit payments. Most of the Companys future policy benefit reserves relate to annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts under which the Company makes annuity payments throughout the term of the contract for a specified portfolio of policies. For certain of these contracts, a single premium is paid at inception of the contract by way of a transfer of cash and investments to the Company. 35 The reserving methodology for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts is described in Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 60 as amended by FAS 97. These contracts subject the Company to risks arising from policyholder mortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected. Liabilities for future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60. Claims and expenses for individual policies within these annuity reinsurance contracts are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows. Assumptions for each element of the basis (mortality, expenses and interest) are determined at the issue of the contract and these assumptions are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists. The assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements (i.e. mortality and interest). Provisions for adverse deviation are sufficient to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimated outcome of the contract. As the experience on the contracts emerges, the assumptions are reviewed. This occurs at least annually and includes both an analysis of experience and review of likely future experience. If such review would produce reserves in excess of those currently held then lock in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, there were no adjustments to the locked in assumptions for any of these contracts. The future policy benefit reserves for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts amounted to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2002. The Company holds the investment assets backing these liabilities. These investments are primarily fixed income securities with maturities that closely match the expected claims settlement profile. As stated above, the future policy benefit reserves include provisions for adverse deviation in excess of best estimate assumptions, that amounted to approximately $60.0 million at December 31, 2002. The future policy benefit reserves would only be increased if these provisions for adverse deviation became insufficient in the light of emerging claims experience. The present value of future claims would increase by approximately 0.3% 0.4% if mortality rates were to decrease by 1% in all future years, relative to the reserving assumptions. 3) Deposit Liabilities The Company has entered into certain contracts with cedants that transfer insufficient risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance transactions. The Company uses a conservative portfolio rate of return of equivalent duration to the liabilities in determining risk transfer. For these contracts, the initial deposit liability equals the cash received at inception. The Company has investment risk related to its ability to generate sufficient investment income to enable the total invested assets to cover the payment of the estimated ultimate liability. The Company establishes an initial accretion rate at inception of the contract. The deposit accretion rate is the rate of return required to fund expected future payment obligations (this is equivalent to the best estimates of future cash flows), which are determined actuarially based upon the nature of the underlying indemnifiable losses. This is a function of the ultimate size of such losses, the impact of the contractual limits upon indemnification of such losses, and the underlying loss settlement process which determines the timing of payments. An increase in the ultimate claims cost or accelerated claims settlement would potentially lead to an increase in the deposit liability accretion rate or lead to incurred losses if significant. The Company has not had any significant change in these assumptions during the last three years ended December 31, 2002. Interest expense of $65.9 million, $47.9 million and $38.4 million was recorded related to the accretion of the deposit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For some of the Companys deposit liabilities the accretion rate is recorded at its contractual limit. For all other contracts, a 1% increase in the average accretion rate would result in an increase in deposit liabilities and interest expense by $8.5 million on an annualized basis. 36 4) Derivative Instruments and Weather and Energy Derivatives The Company records all derivative instruments and weather derivatives at fair value. Changes in fair value of derivatives may create volatility in the Companys results of operations from period to period. For further information regarding sensitivity analysis see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. The Company amended the presentation of its derivative transactions in the consolidated statement of income in 2002 to include the change in fair value of all of its derivative transactions in one line item under net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. Previously, certain components of the change in fair value were reported in net premiums earned, net losses and loss expenses incurred, fee and other income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. There was no effect on net income for this change and prior period results have been reclassified to reflect this change. The Company conducts activities in three main types of derivative instruments: credit default swaps, weather and energy derivatives and investment related derivative instruments. The estimate of fair value for credit default swaps and weather and energy derivatives requires managements judgment. These are discussed below: a) Credit default swaps The Company enters into credit default swaps in connection with its financial guaranty business and the Company intends to hold these contracts to maturity. In determining fair value, management differentiates between investment and non investment grade exposures and models them separately. Management estimates fair value for investment grade exposures by monitoring changes in credit quality and selecting appropriate market indices to determine credit spread movements over the life of the contracts. The determination of the credit spread movements is the basis for calculating the fair value. Installment premiums are also considered in the determination of discounted net cash flows. For credit default swaps that are non investment grade, the Company uses an alternative fair value methodology. The fair value is determined using a model developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, future default rates, credit spreads, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. Other elements of the change in fair value are based upon pricing established at the inception of the contract. The change in this fair value resulting from movements in credit spreads is unrealized as the credit default swaps are not traded to realize this value. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk for sensitivity analysis. b) Weather and Energy Derivatives Weather and energy derivatives are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value included in net realized and unrealized (losses) gains on derivative instruments. Fair value is determined through the use of quoted market prices where available. Where quoted market prices are unavailable, the fair values are estimated using available market data and internal pricing models using consistent statistical methodologies. Estimating fair value of instruments which do not have quoted market prices requires management judgment in determining amounts which could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in settlement of the contracts. The amounts could be materially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect managements best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, actual and forecasted weather conditions, changes in interest rates and other market factors. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk for sensitivity analysis. 5) Other Than Temporary Declines In Investments The Companys process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors. These factors include (i) the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value, (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer, (iii) the significance of the decline, (iv) an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question and (v) the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover. Where the Companys analysis 37 of the above factors results in the Companys conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore realized in the period such determination is made. With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the securitys value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information, market conditions generally and assessing value relative to other comparable securities. Day to day management of the Companys investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss, based upon a change in market and other factors described above. The Company believes that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the Companys portfolio as available for sale. As mentioned above, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers in the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline. However, this factor on its own does not dictate whether or not the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company believes its ability to hold such securities is supported by positive cash flow from its operations where it can generate sufficient cash flow in order to meet its claims payment obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments. In this regard, cash from operating activities was $3.0 billion and $1.4 billion for 2002 and 2001, respectively. There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in general economic conditions as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, subjective assessment of issue specific factors (seniority of claims, collateral value, etc.) future financial market effects, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant disclosure, accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, significant assumptions and management judgment are involved in determining if the decline is other than temporary. If management determines that a decline in fair value is not other than temporary and hence a securitys value is not written down at that time, there are potential effects upon the Companys future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of the investments are other than temporary declines. See Investment Activities Unrealized Losses on Investments for further information. The Companys investments in non traded securities consist of investments over which the Company has significant influence over the operations and which investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with the guidance provided in Accounting Pronouncement Bulletin (APB) 18, Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. These investments consist of closed end investment funds, limited partnerships and similar investment vehicles and strategic insurance and other operating affiliates. The Company also has other investments in non traded securities for which the Company does not have significant influence over the operations. Fair values of non traded securities are estimated by management based upon financial information received and the application of managements judgment. See further information under Investment Activities. 6) Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has capitalized net operating tax losses of $296.0 million against which a valuation allowance of $50.6 million has been established. The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon managements estimates of the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities based on current forecasts and the period for which losses may be carried forward. The Company has exceeded its previous 38 forecast for tax purposes for these entities in 2002 and currently anticipates exceeding these forecasts in 2003. A valuation allowance may have to be established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. Should the taxable income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance would have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax effected. See further information under Other Revenues and Expenses and Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 7) Intangible Assets Intangible assets are carried at or below estimated fair value. There are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Principally, the Company identifies the business entity that the intangible asset is attributed to, reviews historical and forecasted performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis, including market conditions, premium rates and loss trends. Other assumptions used could produce a significantly different result which may result in a change in the value of the intangibles asset and amortization charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Based on the current expectations of profitability an impairment charge would only be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the expected profitability of those operations where such intangible assets are applicable. At December 31, 2002, intangible assets were $1.7 billion of which approximately $1.4 billion and $300.0 million related to the Companys reinsurance and insurance segments, respectively. See Other Revenue and Expenses for further information. 8) Winterthur International Acquisition In connection with its acquisition of Winterthur International in July 2001 in all cash transaction, the Company has recorded a total recoverable from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (the Seller) of $645.7 million at December 31, 2002 based on provisions of the sale and purchase agreement between the parties (SPA). The Company paid to the Seller $405.6 million at closing for Winterthur International based on the audited U.S. GAAP financial statements of the acquired Winterthur International operations as at December 31, 2000 and the price is subject to final determination based on the audited U.S. GAAP financial statements of the acquired Winterthur International operations as at June 30, 2001 (the Completion Financials). By the terms of the SPA, the Seller is required to deliver the Completion Financials to the Company but has not done so to date. The Company expects the Seller to deliver the Completion Financials later in 2003 or to agree with the Seller to an alternative method for determining the final purchase price. See Item 8, Note 6 (c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The SPA provides the Company with post closing protection with respect to adverse development of loss and unearned premium reserves relating to the acquired Winterthur International operations. This protection is based upon actual net loss experience and development over a three year post closing seasoning period based on loss development experience, collectible reinsurance, reinsurance recoveries and certain other factors set forth in the SPA. See Financial Condition and Liquidity for further information. The SPA provides for arbitration should the Seller and the Company disagree on the final amounts due thereunder. In the event such arbitration is commenced in the future, the Company may recognize an impairment if the amount determined to be due to the Company in such arbitration was less than the carrying value of the SPA recovery balance deemed due from the Seller. An impairment also may result in the event that the Company and the Seller agree on an amount that is less than the amount shown as a recovery in the Companys financial statements or to the extent that any amount proves to be uncollectible from the Seller for any reason. 39 Results of Operations The following table presents an after tax analysis of the Companys net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders and a reconciliation of net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders to net operating income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 : (U.S. dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 Net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders $395,951 $(576,135 ) $506,352 Earnings (loss) per ordinary share basic $2.92 $(4.55 ) $4.07 Earnings (loss) per ordinary share diluted (1) $2.88 $(4.55 ) $4.03 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents Basic 135,636 126,676 124,503 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents Diluted (1) 137,388 126,676 125,697 Reconciliation of net income (loss) to net operating income (loss): Net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders $395,951 $(576,135 ) $506,352 Net realized losses (gains) on investments 214,160 93,237 (45,090 ) Tax effect on net realized gains and losses on investments 22,335 5,536 (12,849 ) Net realized and unrealized losses (gains) on derivative instruments 51,761 (11,768 ) (21,405 ) Net realized and unrealized gains on weather and energy risk management derivatives 16,607 16,556 Net operating income (loss) (2) $700,814 $(472,574 ) $427,008 (1) Average stock options outstanding have been excluded where anti dilutive to earnings per ordinary share. (2) Net operating income (loss) is a non GAAP measure. Net operating income (loss) is net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders, excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives (except for gains and losses on weather risk management derivatives). These items are excluded because they are not considered by management to be relevant indicators of the trends in the Companys core business operations, but rather of the investment and credit markets in general. Management believes that the presentation of net operating income (loss) provides useful information regarding the Companys results of operations because it follows industry practice and enables investors and analysts to make performance comparisons with the Companys peers in the insurance industry. This measure may not however be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside of the insurance industry. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this item in assessing the Companys overall financial performance. For 2002 and 2001, the Company had net realized losses on investments and derivative instruments, of $265.9 million and $81.5 million, respectively, as a result of the significant declines in the investment and credit markets and these losses are not included in the calculation of net operating income or loss. Net income increased significantly in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily due to net losses arising from the September 11 event which reduced net income in 2002 by $200.0 million and in 2001 by $796.0 million. Losses were mainly incurred on the property, aviation, personal accident and business interruption lines. Both the insurance and reinsurance segments were affected by this event. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company increased loss reserves by $200.0 million following the receipt of updated loss information. Due principally to the complexity of the claims and inherent lag in reporting from insureds and cedants, management believed it was necessary to increase the estimate for ultimate losses related to this event. This increase included $127.0 million related to the reinsurance segment, primarily due to higher business interruption losses and exposure to potential claims by the Lloyds Central Guaranty Fund in the 40 reinsurance segment. The remaining $73.0 million primarily comprised a loss in the accident and health book of the Companys Lloyds operations in the insurance segment. In addition, net losses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 included net adverse prior year loss development of $400.0 million (including $200.0 million related to the September 11 event discussed above) in 2002 and $175.0 million in 2001. In the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company had net favorable prior year loss development of $395.0 million. In addition, there were relatively fewer catastrophic loss events in 2002 and 2000 as compared to 2001. These are discussed within each of the Companys operating segments below. In 2000, the Company incurred after tax charges of $124.6 million, which included certain reserve adjustments together with employee severance charges and other costs associated with the realignment of the Companys operations and the discontinuation of certain business lines. These charges affected the underwriting results across the Companys insurance and reinsurance segments. Net income in 2002 and 2001 was reduced by net realized losses on investments of $214.2 million and $93.2 million, respectively. The net realized losses in 2002 and 2001 included a loss of $251.5 million and $115.5 million, respectively relating to certain fixed income, equity securities and other investments where the Company determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments. The total amount of an other than temporary decline in value in 2002 related to $144.3 million on fixed income investments, $77.8 million on equity securities and $29.4 million on other investments. Of the decline in value of fixed income and equity securities considered to be other than temporary in 2002, approximately 44% was due to investments in the communications sector. The total amount of an other than temporary decline in value in 2001 related to $66.5 million on fixed income and equity investments and $49.1 million on other investments. The significant circumstances that contributed to these realized losses in 2002 and 2001 included the high level of distress and default in the telecommunications sector, the Enron Corp. bankruptcy, the alleged fraud related to WorldCom Inc. and Adelphia Communication Corp. and a general rise in corporate defaults across other sectors in response to the general decline in the United States and elsewhere. In 2000, the Company had net realized investment gains of $45 million. This is discussed further under Investment Activities. The Company issued 9.2 million ordinary shares on November 7, 2001, which did not significantly dilute the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for 2001. During 2002, the weighted average ordinary shares increased significantly as a result of these shares being in issue for the full year. In 2003, the Company plans to record stock option expense for options granted subsequent to January 1, 2003 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 123, as amended by FAS 148. The Company expects adoption of this statement will be to reduce net income. However, the final determination of this cost is dependent upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the number of options granted and the volatility of the Companys share price and their related effect on the Black Scholes valuation. The cost will be amortized over the vesting period. (Currently, the Companys options have a four year vesting period). The stock option expense could increase in 2004, 2005 and 2006 if new options are granted in those years, due to the cumulative effect of inclusion of options granted in the preceeding four years, as applicable. Segments The Company is organized into three underwriting segments insurance, reinsurance, and financial products and services and a corporate segment, which includes the investment operations of the Company. See Item 1 and Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 41 Insurance Operations The following table summarizes the underwriting profit for this segment (U.S. dollars in thousands): 2002 % Change 02 vs 01 2001 % Change01 vs 00 2000 General: Net premiums earned $2,832,298 66.5 % $1,700,802 56.9 % $1,084,330 Fee income and other 36,717 100.0 % 18,358 NM 1,066 Net losses and loss expenses 1,771,982 21.3 % 1,461,304 91.5 % 763,270 Acquisition costs 478,548 39.4 % 343,247 44.8 % 237,121 Operating expenses 380,901 89.7 % 200,745 63.4 % 122,856 Exchange (gains) losses (56,515 ) NM 8,122 NM (8,330 ) Underwriting profit (loss) $294,099 NM $(294,258 ) NM $(29,521 ) Net (loss) gain on credit default swaps $(16,241 ) NM $8,109 NM $ NM Not Meaningful Effective July 1, 2001, the insurance segment included the results of Winterthur International and the effects thereof should be considered when making period to period comparisons. Net premiums earned by Winterthur International operations, were $779.5 million in 2002 as compared to $353.1 million in 2001. This increase is due to a full year of net earned premiums included in 2002, an increase in premium rates and the renewal of some business previously written by the Companys other insurance operations. Excluding the effect of Winterthur International, net premiums earned increased in the year ended December 31, 2002 over 2001 primarily due to significant price increases, new business written and an increase in net retention of business written. The increase in net premiums earned was across all lines of business, particularly in the aviation and professional liability lines. Pricing began to increase in 2001 and was due to a market turnaround following five years of poor underwriting performance throughout the property and casualty industry and these price increases were further compounded by the September 11 event. Partially offsetting this increase in net premiums earned is the effect of the Company exiting program business at its Lloyds operations and specialty workers compensation business in the U.S. with effect from January 1, 2002. Net premiums earned are expected to increase on all lines in 2003 mainly due to the growth in net premiums written during 2002. Excluding the effect of Wintherthur International, net premiums earned increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 also due to new business written and price increases. This was partially offset by certain business discontinued in 2000. Net premiums earned by Winterthur International in 2001 were approximately $353.1 million. Fee income and other increased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to approximately $21.0 million of contingent income received in the fourth quarter of 2002 that related to the sale in 1999 of the motor business written by the Companys Lloyds syndicates. This was partially offset by a decrease in the amount of fee income received in 2002 related to Winterthur International for the provision of consulting and administration services for employee benefit plans of unrelated companies. Fee income and other increased in 2001 over 2000 due to Winterthur International for these services that generated $9.1 million of income in 2001. Due to the one off nature of the contingent income discussed above, fee income and other is expected to decline in 2003. The Company began to write structured credit default swaps at primary layers in this segment in 2001. Credit default swaps are derivative transactions and the change in the fair value is included in net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. The change in fair value was a loss of $16.2 million and a gain of $8.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The loss in 2002 relates primarily to an increase in credit events reported in the year, in line with a deterioration of the credit markets in general. The Company has amended the presentation of the results of operations for its credit default swap transactions. The change in fair value of these credit default swap transactions is now included in net realized and unrealized gains and 42 losses on derivative instruments. Previously the change in fair value was reported in net premiums earned, net losses and loss expenses incurred and net realized gains and losses on derivatives. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The increase in the underwriting profit in 2002 over 2001 and reduction in 2001 over 2000 is reflective of the loss and loss expense ratios as shown below. The following table presents the ratios for this segment for each of the three years ended December 31: 2002 2001 2000 Loss and loss expense ratio 62.6 % 85.9 % 70.4 % Underwriting expense ratio 30.3 % 32.0 % 33.2 % Combined ratio 92.9 % 117.9 % 103.6 % The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred for both the current year and any adverse or favorable prior year development of loss and loss reserves held at the beginning of the year. The loss ratio was lower in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to a relatively lower level of current year loss activity, a change in the mix of business where growth in premium earned has occurred for certain lines that had a relatively lower loss ratio as compared to other lines written in the segment, and the positive effect of pricing increases across most lines written. Current year loss activity in 2001 included $317.9 million of net losses incurred relating to the September 11 event. The lower current year loss activity in 2002 as compared to 2001 was partially offset by adverse net prior year loss development in 2002 as opposed to favorable prior year loss development in 2001. The following tables present the prior year adverse or favorable development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves for its insurance operations: (U.S. dollars in millions) Gross 2002 2001 2000 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $7,834 $3,046 $2,980 Net adverse (favorable) development of those reserves during the year 54 69 (409 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $7,888 $3,115 $2,571 Net 2002 2001 2000 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $4,680 $2,457 $2,386 Net adverse (favorable) development of those reserves during the year 28 (78 ) (456 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $4,708 $2,379 $1,930 During 2002, the Companys net adverse prior year development of $28 million was comprised of an increase in loss reserves of $73 million relating to the September 11 event that was partially offset by a net decrease in the other reserves of $45 million. The increase in 2002 in the estimate of the ultimate losses relating to the September 11 event of $73 million related primarily to the accident and health business written in the Companys Lloyds operations. The Company had originally recorded ultimate losses for the September 11 event in the insurance segment of $318 million in 2001 based on managements best estimate at that time. This best estimate was based on an analysis which had been performed to attempt to identify all possible claims and to analyze the magnitude 43 of the potential loss. However, the September 11 event was estimated to have caused the largest man made insured event in the history of the insurance industry, which made such estimation inherently difficult. In addition, because the timing of the event was relatively close to the end of the year, much of the information received by the Company at that date was preliminary. The increase in the loss reserves occurred in the second quarter of 2002 after the Company received additional information from policyholders with regard to claims relating to their insured employee casualties, including estimates of benefits payable under U.S. workers compensation statutes. Following receipt of this new information, the Company completed an additional review of the reserves for this line of business. As a result of this review, management increased the ultimate loss reserves for this loss event. The net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the other insurance reserves at the beginning of 2002 was $4.4 billion. During 2002, the Company decreased the estimate of these reserves by a net amount of $45 million, consisting of a decrease in reserves relating to the excess casualty insurance business of $114 million partially offset by increases in prior year reserves for satellite lines of $30 million and other casualty insurance lines of $39 million. Estimated ultimate loss reserves were reduced for excess casualty insurance based upon lower than expected actual reported loss experience for business written in years 1997 and prior. A lack of available industry data resulted in more actuarial judgment being involved in establishing IBNR loss reserves for this line of business in the earlier years. Estimated loss reserves are then regularly updated to take into account actual claims reported. The adverse development experienced in the satellite lines was due to several satellite malfunctions that caused an increase in actual reported loss activity that was greater than expected. The adverse development for the other casualty lines was for business written in 1999 through 2001. In these years, premium rates for casualty business had declined due to competitive market pressures and in 2002, there was an increase in the size of claims reported that was higher than expected. The Company did not change its methodology or key assumptions used in 2002 to determine ultimate loss reserves for this or any other line of insurance business written. During 2001 and 2000, the net favorable prior year loss development of $78 million and $456 million, respectively, related principally to the Companys excess casualty insurance business. 2001 favorable development related to business written in 1994 through 1997. Favorable development in 2000 related to business written in 1993 through 1998. Similar to 2002, favorable development was due primarily to judgment required in establishing reserves for this line of business due to the lack of industry data available as described above. The Company did not change its methodology or key assumptions for this business in either 2001 or 2000. While the Company has experienced favorable development in the high layer excess casualty lines for the last several years, there is no assurance that conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past will continue. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on the Companys historical results. Excluding the effect of September 11, 2001, the loss ratio in 2001 was 66.7% as compared to 70.4% in 2000. In 2000, net incurred losses included $33.5 million relating to an intercompany stop loss arrangement with a subsidiary in the reinsurance segment. There was no such arrangement in place in 2002 or 2001. Partially offsetting this decrease was other significant current year loss events in 2001 including the Toulouse, France petrochemical plant explosion and the airport loss event in Sri Lanka, totaling approximately $19.0 million. There were no significant catastrophic loss events for this segment in the year ended December 31, 2000. Business written by Winterthur International in force at June 30, 2001 carries a maximum exposure to a combined ratio of 105% under the Sale and Purchase agreement with the seller. See Item 8, Note 6(c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in 2002 over 2001 is due to a reduction in the acquisition expense ratio that has been partially offset by an increase in the operating expense ratio. The acquisition expense ratio has decreased due to a change in the mix of business earned where there has been an increase in certain lines which typically carry a lower commission and brokerage cost. In addition, 44 2001 net premiums earned were reduced by $25.3 million related to the September 11 event that contributed to higher ratios in 2001. Operating expenses include $181.6 million and $69.8 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively, relating to the operations of Winterthur International. This increase reflects a full year of Winterthur Internationals results in 2002 as well as costs associated with the building and integration of their infrastructure. In addition, 2002 was also affected by an increase in operating expenses at the Company Lloyds operations where the Company now owns 100% of the syndicate capacity. The underwriting expense ratio decreased slightly in 2001 as compared to 2000 due primarily to the effect of purchase accounting treatment on the acquisition costs of Winterthur International which reduced acquisition expenses in 2001 by $19.3 million. Had an historical level of deferred acquisition costs been amortized, the expense ratio for the segment would have been 33.2% in 2001 which is the same as the ratio in 2000. Exchange gains of $56.5 million in 2002 were primarily due to a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against U.K. sterling and Swiss franc in those operations that have monetary assets and liabilities denominated in these foreign currencies. With the acquisition of Winterthur International, the Company now has a substantial European platform and therefore is further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements. The Company is currently reviewing alternative strategies to mitigate its currency risk. Reinsurance Operations Reinsurance General Operations The following table summarizes the underwriting results for the general operations of this segment (U.S. dollars in thousands): 2002 % Change 02 vs 01 2001 % Change01 vs 00 2000 Net premiums earned $2,066,775 100.7 % $1,029,618 11.0 % $927,195 Fee income and other 11,201 256.0 % (7,180 ) (226.8 )% (2,197 ) Net losses and loss expenses 1,557,065 9.0 % 1,428,772 115.4 % 663,173 Acquisition costs 454,300 55.5 % 292,069 18.1 % 247,352 Operating expenses 109,796 26.0 % 87,169 (14.7 )% 102,132 Exchange (gains) losses (23,787 ) NM 4,062 5.0 % 3,868 Underwriting loss $(19,398 ) NM $(789,634 ) NM $(91,527 ) Underwriting results for the year ended December 31, 2001 were significantly affected by the September 11 event. Net premiums earned increased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to new business growth and significant price increases across most lines of business written in 2002 and 2001, notably casualty and property lines. In addition, 2002 includes net premiums earned of $241.5 million relating to Le Mans R where the Company acquired a majority ownership and was therefore consolidated with the Companys financial results, with effect from January 1, 2002. Significant pricing increases were due to a market turnaround following five years of poor underwriting performance throughout the property and casualty industry. These pricing increases were further compounded by the September 11 event. Also, net premiums earned in 2001 were negatively impacted by $120.4 million of net reinstatement premiums related to the September 11 event. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Net premiums earned are expected to increase on all lines in 2003 mainly due to the growth in net premiums written during 2002. Net premiums earned in 2001 increased over 2000 due to additional premiums earned, primarily on property lines, from increased premium rates and new business written. This was partially offset by the net reinstatement premiums resulting from the September 11 event, mentioned above. Fee income and other in 2002 relates primarily to the earning of fees on two deposit liability contracts that were commuted in the second and third quarters of 2002. Fee income and other in 2001 and 2000 was 45 negative due to non underwriting costs for an outward reinsurance contract. Due to the one off nature of the income discussed above, fee income and other is expected to decline in 2003. The following table presents the underwriting ratios for this segment: 2002 2001 2000 Loss and loss expense ratio 75.3 % 138.8 % 71.5 % Underwriting expense ratio 27.3 % 36.8 % 37.7 % Combined ratio 102.6 % 175.6 % 109.2 % The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred for both the current year and any adverse or favorable prior year development of loss and loss reserves held at the beginning of the year. The loss ratio was lower in the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to a relatively lower level of current year loss activity and the positive effect of pricing increases across most lines written. Current year loss activity in 2001 included $442.1 million of net losses incurred relating to the September 11 event. The following tables present the adverse prior year development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves for its reinsurance general operations: (U.S. dollars in millions) Gross 2002 2001 2000 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $3,947 $2,614 $2,382 Net adverse (favourable) development of those reserves during the year 504 381 306 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $4,451 $2,995 $2,688 Net 2002 2001 2000 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $2,467 $1,863 $2,145 Net adverse (favourable) development of those reserves during the year 385 253 61 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $2,852 $2,116 $2,206 During 2002, the Companys prior year estimate of the year end 2001 net reserve increased by $385 million. This increase was comprised of an increase of $127 million related to the September 11 event and an increase of $258 million for all other reinsurance reserves. The increase in estimate for the September 11 event of $127 million related primarily to higher than originally estimated business interruption losses and exposure to potential claims by the Lloyds Central Guaranty Fund. The increase in estimate was recorded in the second quarter of 2002 following an analysis of additional new information received from the Companys ceding companies with regard to their increased estimates of claims relating to their exposures to the September 11 event. During 2001, the Company had recorded incurred losses for the September 11 event for its reinsurance operations of $442 million. Due to the size and complexity of the loss and the time lag in ceding companies reporting the information to the Company, establishing reserves for this loss within a short time period was difficult. The increase in estimate for all other reinsurance reserves in 2002 of $258 million related principally to losses on business written in 1997 through (and including) 2000 in the Companys U.S. casualty reinsurance business and for asbestos losses in years prior to 1985. This increase was partially offset by decreases in estimates for losses related to business written in 1985 through 1996 in these same lines of business. The 46 reporting and settlement period for reinsurance casualty business is relatively long and, in some cases, can be up to 30 years or more from the inception date. Moreover, reporting and settlement patterns can vary significantly from year to year. During the years 1998 through 2000, competitive market pressures on pricing caused premium rates for excess casualty business to decline industry wide. For these calendar years, there has been an increase in the number and size of claims reported in 2002 as a result of recent increases in court filings and settlements. This increase has caused the Company to increase its estimated ultimate reserves for this business. The Company did not change its methodology or key assumptions for determining ultimate loss reserves in 2002. The Company updated its assumptions for asbestos loss reserves in 2002 to take account of an increase in 2002 in the number and size of the ultimate asbestos claims that the Company anticipates on the policies underwritten during the years 1972 through 1985. These changes were based on recent increases in court filings and settlements on behalf of asbestos claimants and bankruptcies of asbestos defendants which tend to shift liabilities to other parties. The Companys increase of $30 million in 2002 increased its total net reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures to $66 million, which was below 1% of the Companys total unpaid loss and loss expenses at December 31, 2002. The Company utilizes industry standard asbestos and environmental claims models to estimate its ultimate liability for these exposures. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 537 open claim files for potential asbestos exposures and 515 open claim files for potential environmental exposures on business written prior to 1986. Approximately 44% of the open claim files for both 2002 and 2001 and 45% for 2000 are due to precautionary claim notices. Precautionary claim notices are submitted by the ceding companies in order to preserve their right to receive coverage under the reinsurance contract. Such notices do not contain an incurred loss amount to the Company. The development of the number of open claim files for potential asbestos and environmental claims is as follows: AsbestosClaims EnvironmentalClaims Total number of claims outstanding at December 31, 2000 374 613 New claims reported in 2001 122 33 Claims resolved in 2001 43 103 Total number of claims outstanding at December 31, 2001 453 543 New claims reported in 2002 117 42 Claims resolved in 2002 33 70 Total number of claims outstanding at December 31, 2002 537 515 The Companys exposure to asbestos and environmental claims arise from policies written, both on a proportional and excess basis, after 1972. The Company discontinued writing policies with these exposures in 1985. Business written was across many different policies each with a relatively small contract limit. The Companys recently reported asbestos claims related to both traditional products and premises and operations coverage. The estimation of loss and loss expense liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures is subject to much greater uncertainty than is normally associated with the establishment of liabilities for certain other exposures due to several factors, including: (i) uncertain legal interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage and liability; (ii) the lack of reliability of available historical claims data as an indicator of future claims development; (iii) an uncertain political climate which may impact, among other areas, the nature and amount of costs for remediating waste sites; and (iv) the potential of insurers and reinsurers to reach agreements in order to avoid further significant legal costs. Due to the potential significance of these uncertainties, the Company believes that no meaningful range of loss and loss expense liabilities beyond recorded reserves can be established. As the Companys net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves related to asbestos and environmental exposures is less than 1% of the total net reserves at December 31, 2002, 47 further adverse development is not expected to be material to the Companys overall net loss reserves. See Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The Company believes it has made reasonable provision for its asbestos and environmental exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would significantly affect its estimate for loss and loss expenses. During 2001 and 2000, the Companys prior estimate of the year end net reserves increased by $253 million and $61 million, respectively. The increase in 2001 related principally to loss estimates for losses occurring in 1998 through (and including) 2000. The increase in 2000 related principally to loss estimates for losses occurring in 1997 through (and including) 1999. Both years increases related to the Companys casualty reinsurance business. The reasons were the same as those explained above. The Company did not change its methodology or key assumptions in 2001 or 2000. This adverse development was due to an increase in the size and frequency of the reported claims for these lines that was greater than previously expected in the underlying loss reporting patterns used to estimate ultimate losses. The Company has experienced adverse development in the casualty reinsurance business for the last several years and there can be no assurance that conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past will not continue. The loss and loss expense ratio in 2001 was also affected by the negative impact of the reinstatement premiums on net premiums earned related to the September 11 event as noted above. In 2002, current year net losses incurred included $30.0 million for the European Floods while in 2001 other current year loss events, excluding the September 11 event, totaled approximately $93.0 million. This included the Sri Lanka airport loss, Tropical Storm Allison, the Petrobras oil rig loss in Brazil and the Toulouse, France petrochemical plant explosion. Property catastrophe business has loss experience that is generally categorized as low frequency but high severity in nature. This may result in volatility in the Companys financial results for any fiscal year or quarter. The 2001 loss ratio excluding the September 11 event would have been 85.8% as compared to the loss ratio in 2000 of 71.5%. The higher loss ratio was mainly due to net adverse development described above. Current year loss events in 2000 totaled approximately $95.0 million, which included an oil refinery loss in Kuwait, several satellite losses and the Singapore Airlines loss. The underwriting expense ratio in 2001 was also affected by the negative impact of the September 11 event reinstatement premiums on net premiums earned. Excluding the effect of the reinstatement premiums the underwriting expense ratio would have been 33.0% in 2001 as compared to 27.3% in 2002. The reduction in the underwriting expense ratio is due primarily to a change in the mix of business in net premiums earned where certain lines have a lower commission rate and also due to the growth in net premiums earned being greater than the growth in operating expenses. Operating expenses generally do not change in direct proportion to changes in net premiums earned, particularly where they are due to price changes. Partially offsetting this is a reduction in 2001 of approximately $7.0 million related to certain compensation expenses accrued in previous years. This is the main reason for the decrease in the underwriting expense ratio, excluding the September 11 event in 2001 as compared to 2000. Exchange gains in 2002 of $23.8 million were mainly attributable to a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against U.K. sterling and the Euro in those operations that write business globally. The Companys European operations have expanded due to the consolidation of the results of Le Mans R. The Company is currently reviewing alternative strategies to mitigate its currency risk. 48 Reinsurance Life Operations The following table summarizes the net income (loss) from life operations of this segment (U.S. dollars in thousands): 2002 % Change 02 vs 01 2001 % Change01 vs 00 2000 Net premiums earned $980,387 40.9 % $695,595 NM Fee income and other 2 NM Claims and policy benefits 1,027,981 47.1 % 698,675 NM Acquisition costs 12,839 NM Operating expenses 5,844 NM Net investment income 91,451 NM Net income (loss) $25,176 NM $(3,080 ) NM Life premiums earned in 2002 included a large contract written in the third quarter of 2002 consisting of a U.K. portfolio of annuities. This contract increased net premiums earned and claims and policy benefits by $762.7 million and $776.8 million respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company wrote another large contract of European annuities for $549.3 million of net premium earned and policy benefits. The Company acquired cash and investment assets related to the future policy benefit reserves assumed at inception of these large contracts. While the Company expects to write more of these contracts, the frequency of these transactions will likely be irregular. Excluding these large contracts, net premiums earned in life reinsurance increased in 2002 over 2001 as the Company has expanded its life reinsurance operations and also due to life reinsurance business written by Le Mans R. The life operations included $32.3 million of net premiums earned on life business from Le Mans R, which was included as a consolidated subsidiary with effect from January 1, 2002. Net investment income is included in the calculation of net income from life operations as it relates to income earned on portfolios of separately identified and managed life investment assets and other allocated assets. The accretion of the related future policy benefit reserves is included in claims and policy benefits. Financial Products and Services Operations Financial Products and Services General Operations The following table summarizes the underwriting results for this segment (U.S. dollars in thousands): General: 2002 % Change 02 vs 01 2001 % Change01 vs 00 2000 Net premiums earned $67,745 82.5 % $37,113 56.5 % $23,715 Fee income and other 7,043 NM 7,069 NM Net losses and loss expenses (1,732 ) (111.4 )% 15,155 147.8 % 6,116 Acquisition costs 9,644 158.6 % 3,730 181.9 % 1,323 Operating expenses 61,543 45.1 % 42,404 41.5 % 29,969 Exchange losses 8 NM Underwriting profit (loss) $5,325 NM $(17,107 ) (24.9 )% $(13,693 ) Net (losses) gains on credit default swaps $(29,896 ) 8.6 % $(27,535 ) NM $15,924 Net gains (losses) on weather and energy risk management contracts $16,607 NM $16,556 NM $ 49 Net premiums earned in 2002 increased compared to 2001 and 2000 due to an increase in net premiums written in 2002 and 2001 related to an expansion of the financial guaranty business. In 2002 and 2001, financial guaranty business included primary and secondary municipal portfolios, asset backed securities, structured finance transactions and reinsurance assumed. In 2000, most of the business was treaty business assumed from one financial guaranty company. Net premiums earned in 2002 also included $5.1 million related to weather risk management products written in insurance form as compared to $4.5 million in 2001. Fee income and other in 2002 and 2001 related primarily to liquidity facility fees earned from one of the Companys financial guaranty contracts. Fee income and other is expected to decrease in 2003. As with the Companys property and casualty insurance and reinsurance operations, net losses and loss expenses include current year net losses incurred and adverse or favorable devlopment of prior year net loss and loss expenses reserves. In 2002, net losses incurred were negative due to favorable development of prior year loss and loss expense reserves. The following tables present the favorable development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves for its general financial products and services operations: (U.S. dollars in millions) Gross and Net 2002 2001 2000 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $26 $12 $6 Net adverse (favourable) development of those reserves during the year (13 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $13 $12 $6 During 2002 the Companys prior estimate of the year end 2001 net reserve of $26 million decreased by $13 million to $13 million as at December 31, 2002. This change in estimate was due entirely to the financial guaranty business written within this segment for losses related to business written in 1998 through and including 2001. The Company commenced writing financial guaranty business in 1998 and had relied entirely upon industry data to establish reserves until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Company refined its assumptions to take into account its actual historical loss experience and revised its estimated claim reporting pattern for the IBNR losses that the Company records during each loss year. The Company uses this expected loss reporting pattern, combined with changes in reported losses, to determine the prior year development amount. Since reported losses for this business have been less than expected, the refinement in assumptions resulted in a decrease in the estimate of reserves for prior years. In 2001 and 2000, the Company did not change its prior year loss reserves because it did not have sufficient Company specific loss experience data available to justify amending the Companys initial assumptions. Acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned increased in 2002 as compared to 2001 and 2000. The reasons for this increase is due to an increase in reinsurance assumed from third parties which carries an acquisition commission cost of approximately 30%. In addition, in 2002 there were less offsetting commissions earned due to lower reinsurance purchased and an increased cost associated with the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs. Operating expenses increased in 2002 as compared to 2001 and 2000 primarily due to compensation costs of new staff as a result of the continued expansions of these operations, which includes the guaranteed municipal reinvestment contract business. The Company also insures payment obligations to counterparties under Institutional Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation or swap form, which are swap derivative transactions. The 50 vast majority of financial guaranty coverage that is written in swap form pertains to tranches of collateralized debt obligations and asset backed securities, particularly the higher rated tranches. See Item 8, Notes 15 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has amended the presentation of the results of operations for its credit default swap transactions in 2002. The change in fair value of these credit default swap transactions is included in net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. Previously the change in fair value had been reported in net premiums earned, net losses and loss expenses incurred and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform with the current years presentation. Since most of these credit default swap transactions tend to be unique and there is no traded market or any intention to sell such exposures, the Company fair values such instruments by creating models which track similar markets which may have some trading or market activity. The Company creates indicies by using proxies of credit spreads and monitors changes in those spreads as well as changes in the credit quality for investment grade exposures. Non investment grade exposures are modeled based on statistical and probabilistic assumptions regarding interest rates, historical default rates and expected recovery rates. The model requires significant judgments to be made by management in determining the ultimate loss and is sensitive to changes in market conditions, particularly credit spreads. The Company recorded a loss on credit default swaps of $29.9 million and $27.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The reduction in value in 2002 was due to a significant widening of credit spreads, widespread ratings downgrades of corporate obligors, and certain specific credit events reported in the year on a small number of transactions. The Company continues to monitor its credit exposures and establish reserves as required. In 2001, the Company commenced trading in weather and energy risk management derivatives in this segment. These derivative contracts are also recorded at fair value. In 2002, the Company changed the presentation of the change in fair value which is now included in the net realized and unrealized (losses) gains on derivative instruments. In 2001 the change in fair value was included in fee income and other. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform with the current years presentation. Net realized and unrealized gains on these derivatives were $16.6 million in 2002 and 2001. Financial Products and Services Life Operations The following table summarizes the net income from life operations of this segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2002 % Change 02 vs 01 2001 % Change01 vs 00 2000 Net premiums earned $42,605 NM Fee income and other Claims and policy benefits 41,475 NM Acquisition costs Operating expenses 404 NM Fee and other income Net investment income Net income $726 NM The Company commenced writing life business in this segment in 2002. Net premiums earned related to certain blocks of U.S. based term life mortality reinsurance business novated to the Company on December 31, 2002 from one of its insurance affiliates. The Company acquired a portfolio of future policy benefit reserves and cash in this transaction which resulted in $41.5 million in net premiums earned and claims and policy benefits. See Financial Condition and Liquidity for further information and Item 8, Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Investment Activities The following table illustrates the change in net investment income, net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment derivatives for each of the three years ended December 31, 2002. 51 (U.S. dollars in thousands): 2002 % Change 02 vs 01 2001 % Change01 vs 00 2000 Net investment income $734,535 20.3 % $610,528 5.1 % $580,946 Net realized (losses) gains on investments $(214,160 ) 129.7 % $(93,237 ) NM $45,090 Net realized and unrealized (losses) gains on investment derivative instruments (1) $(22,231 ) NM $14,638 167.1 % $5,481 (1) For a summary of realized and unrealized gains and losses on all derivative instruments, see Item 8, Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Investment Income The following table shows the average investments, the aggregate investment income and the annualized effective yield for each of the years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31 AverageInvestments (1) Net Pre TaxInvestment Income (2) AnnualizedEffective Yield 2002 $17,162,445 $734,535 4.28% 2001 11,053,110 610,528 5.52% 2000 9,058,811 580,946 6.41% (1) Average of the beginning and ending amounts of total investments and cash and cash equivalents net of pending trades for the period. Investment securities are carried at market value. (2) After applicable investment expenses, excluding net realized gains and losses on investments and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. (3) Certain prior period results have been amended to conform to the current years presentation. Net investment income increased in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to growth in the investment base. Investments available for sale and cash and cash equivalents less net pending payable for investments purchased was $18.1 billion at December 31, 2002 as compared to $13.0 billion at December 31, 2001. This increase of $5.1 billion includes (i) the issue of preference shares in the third and fourth quarter of 2002 generating net proceeds of $222.8 million and $278.4 million, respectively; (ii) $250.0 million of net proceeds relating to the issue of $600.0 million 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2012, after debt repayment of $350.0 million; (iii) cash flow from operations of $3.0 billion; and (iv) investment assets of approximately $653.3 million relating to the consolidation of Le Mans R&eacute; as a subsidiary with effect from January 1, 2002. The increase in investment income was partially offset by a 1.24% reduction in the annualized effective yield of the investment portfolio (4.28% for 2002 as compared to 5.52% for 2001). The reduction in the effective yield of the investment portfolio was due to a general decline in interest rates in the U.S. and Europe, with the reduction in rates attributed to markets discounting a slowdown in economic activity. For example, during 2002 the yield on 5 Year U.S. Treasury securities declined by approximately 1.60%, the yield on the 5 Year Euro denominated government securities declined by approximately 1.00% and the yield on 5 Year U.K. Government securities declined by approximately 0.90%. Net investment income also increased in 2001 as compared to 2000 due primarily to a higher investment base. The investment base in 2001 included the receipt of net funds of $1.1 billion related to new debt issued by the Company during the second and third quarters of 2001. As previously noted, the Company also acquired the net assets of Winterthur International from July 1, 2001, increasing the Companys investment assets by $1.4 billion. In addition, in November 2001, the Company issued 9.2 million shares for net proceeds of $787.7 million. The effect of the higher investment base was offset by decreases in the general interest rate levels as a result of the lowering of rates by the Federal Reserve Bank through 2001. 52 It is expected that investment income in 2003 will be affected by the low level of investment rates. This is expected to be offset to some degree by positive operating cash flow, assuming no large unusual loss events. See further discussion in Financial Condition and Liquidity. Assets related to insurance and reinsurance deposit liabilities are included in investments available for sale. The accretion charge on these deposit liabilities is included in interest expense. The Company has amended the presentation of this accretion charge in 2002 where previously it was shown as a deduction from net investment income. Prior periods information has been amended to conform with the current years presentation. In addition, assets related to guaranteed investment contracts are also included in investments available for sale. See further discussion in Item 8, Note 7 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investment Performance Measurement of investment performance is a function of the investment strategy and business purpose for each of the components of the investment portfolio. Investment perfomance is based upon total return of the portfolio that includes net investment income, net realized gains and losses on investments, net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment derivatives and the change in the net unrealized gains and losses on investments. Within the actively managed portion of the asset/liability portfolio, the objective is to maximize total investment returns at a risk level that is managed relative to applicable public market fixed income indices. However, the deposit and regulatory holdings portion of the asset/liability portfolio is subject to investment restrictions that limit the effectiveness of active discretionary management. As a result, comparisons of the deposit and regulatory holdings portion of the Companys asset/liability portfolio with public market indices are not meaningful. Due to the unique nature of the underlying liabilities in the Companys structured product portfolio (i.e. deposit liabilities and future policy benefit reserves), customized benchmarks are used to measure performance. Finally, certain of the Companys business investments are private market transactions that cannot be meaningfully compared to certain public indicies. Accordingly, only approximately 40% of the Companys total investment portfolio could be meaningfully compared to public market indicies. 53 The table below summarizes investment performance for those portions of the asset/liability and risk asset portfolios that could be meaningfully compared to public market indices for each of the years ending December 31 presented below: Year ended December 31, 2002 Year endedDecember 31,2001 Year ended December 31,2000 Asset/Liability Portfolios U.S. Investment Grade, Moderate Duration 9.0% 9.2% 10.6% Lehman Aggregate Bond Index 10.3% 8.4% 11.6% Relative Performance (1.3)% 0.8% (1.0)% U.S. Investment Grade, Low Duration 3.8% 10.1% 6.1% Salomon 1 3 Year Treasury Index 5.8% 8.3% 8.0% Relative Performance (2.0)% 1.8% (1.9)% Euro Aggregate, Unhedged 8.1% n/a n/a Lehman Euro Aggregate Index 9.5% n/a n/a Relative Performance (1.4)% n/a n/a Pan European, Hedged 23.1% n/a n/a Merrill U.K. / Merrill Pan Europe Composite 25.2% n/a n/a Relative Performance (2.1)% n/a n/a U.K. Sterling, Unhedged 8.5% n/a n/a Merrill U.K. Sterling Broad Index, 1 10 Years 8.8% n/a n/a Relative Performance (0.3)% n/a n/a Risk Asset Portfolios Fixed Income U.S. Moderate Grade 1.0% 7.5% 4.7% Investment Grade / High Yield Composite 7.9% 9.7% 7.1% Relative Performance (6.9)% (2.2)% (2.4)% U.S. High Yield (4.3)% 3.4% 0.1% CS First Boston High Yield Index 3.1% 5.8% (5.2)% Relative Performance (7.4)% (2.4)% 5.3% 54 Year ended December 31, 2002 Year endedDecember 31,2001 Year ended December 31,2000 Risk Asset Portfolios Equities U.S. Large Cap Growth Equity (30.1)% (29.6)% (9.4)% Russell 1000 Growth Index (28.0)% (20.5)% (22.5)% Relative Performance (2.1)% (9.1)% 13.1% U.S. Large Cap Value Equity (12.5)% 3.8% n/a Russell 1000 Value Index (15.8)% (5.9)% n/a Relative Performance 3.3% 9.7% n/a U.S. Small Cap Equity (15.9)% 5.2% n/a Russell 2000 Index (20.6)% 2.3% n/a Relative Performance 4.7% 2.9% n/a Non U.S. Equity (16.1)% (18.5)% (4.4)% MSCI EAFE Index (15.9)% (21.4)% (11.5)% Relative Performance (0.2)% 2.9% 7.1% Risk Asset Portfolios Alternative Investments Alternative Investments 6.7% 14.3% 15.6% Standard and Poors 500 Index (22.1)% (11.9)% (9.2)% Relative Performance 28.8% 26.2% 24.8% n/a indicates that portfolios comparable to this benchmark have been in existence for less than the period indicated.

Realized loss on investments and other than temporary declines in the value of investments The Companys investment portfolio is classified as available for sale. Realized investment gains and losses are incurred through the normal turnover of the Companys investment portfolio. Realized investment losses include impairment charges relating to declines in value of securities that are considered to be other than temporary. See Critical Accounting Policies for further information. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company had net realized losses on investments of $214.2 million. This included gross realized losses on fixed income and equity securities of $526.3 million and $160.1 million, respectively. Gross and net realized losses included $251.5 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary. Of the total provisions, $144.3 million related to fixed income securities, $77.8 million to equity securities and $29.4 million to other investments. Approximately 44% of the declines in fair value of fixed income and equity securities considered to be other than temporary related to the communications sector, including Worldcom Inc. and Adelphia Communication Corp. in the second quarter of 2002 where the decline in the value of such securities was due to alleged fraud. In addition, approximately $41.0 million of gross realized losses related to sales of Worldcom Inc. and Adelphia Communication Corp. 55 During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company had net realized losses on investments of $93.2 million. This included gross realized losses on fixed income and equity securities of $373.6 million and $140.9 million, respectively. Gross and net realized losses on investments included $115.5 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary, $66.4 million of which related to fixed income and equity securities and $49.1 million of which related to the Companys other investments. The significant circumstances that contributed to these realized losses in 2002 and 2001 included the high level of distress and default in the telecommunications sector, the Enron Corp. bankruptcy and a general rise in corporate defaults across other sectors in response to the general economic decline in the United States and elsewhere. For the securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2002, the fair market value of the fixed income securities and equity securities at the sales dates was approximately $8.5 billion and $306.0 million, respectively. For the securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2001, the fair market value of the fixed income securities and equity securities at the sales dates was approximately $8.8 billion and $350.0 million, respectively. With respect to those securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2002 the following is an analysis of the period of time that those securities had been in an unrealized loss position, the amount of the realized loss recorded in the Companys results of operations as of the sale date and the amount of the impairment charge taken in the year: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Length of time in a continual unrealized loss position Fixed Income Securities Equity Securities Less than 6 months $284,259 $60,925 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 59,350 14,128 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 19,429 6,830 At least 2 years but less than 3 years 18,983 411 Total gross realized loss from sales 382,021 82,294 Impairment charges for declines in value considered to be other than temporary 144,255 77,832 Total gross realized loss $ 526,276 $ 160,126 With respect to those securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2001 the following is an analysis of the period of time that those securities had been in an unrealized loss position, the amount of the realized loss recorded in the Companys results of operations as of the sale date and the amount of the impairment charge taken in the year: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Length of time in a continual unrealized loss position Fixed Income Securities Equity Securities Less than 6 months $199,658 $79,119 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 27,429 27,399 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 106,244 5,602 At least 2 years but less than 3 years 2,101 597 Total gross realized loss from sales 335,432 112,717 Impairment charges for declines in value considered to be other than temporary 38,219 28,147 Total gross realized loss $373,651 $140,864 The Companys process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors. These factors include (i) the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value, (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall 56 financial condition of the issuer, (iii) the significance of the decline, (iv) an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question and (v) the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover. Where the Companys analysis of the above factors results in the Companys conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore realized. With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the securitys value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss. As mentioned above, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers in the process of evaluating whether a security with an unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline. However, this factor, on its own, does not dictate whether or not the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company believes its ability to hold such securities is supported by its positive cash flow from operations where it can generate sufficient cash flow in order to meet its claims payment obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments. Cash from operating activities was $3.0 billion and $1.4 billion for 2002 and 2001, respectively. However, subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information and assessing value relative to other comparable securities. While the Companys external investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe the preferred course of action is to hold securities until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss, based upon a change in market and other factors. The Company believes these subsequent decisions are consistent with the classification of its investment portfolio as available for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company realized a loss of $38.4 million and $7.2 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equity securities, respectively, that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company realized a loss of $108.3 million and $6.2 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equity securities, respectively, that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. The decisions to sell these securities were made by the Companys investment managers based upon a change in market conditions and other factors (which decisions were independent of the Companys previously stated intent and ability to hold such securities). The significant circumstances that contributed to the realized losses on the Companys fixed income and equity securities during the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 also affected the Companys other investments. Of the total impairment charge taken in 2002 and 2001 of $251.5 million and $115.5 million, respectfully, $29.4 million and $49.1 million related to the Companys other investments. The Companys other investments include investments in private equity limited partnerships which also experienced significant market wide declines. In 2002, the Company wrote down the carrying value of its investment in Mutual Risk Management Ltd by $20.0 million. In 2001, declines in value of the Companys other investments were greatest in the technology sector and write downs in the portfolio were mainly a result of re evaluations of technology and financial services investments, reflecting the reduced business prospects of these companies. Net realized and unrealized gains on investment derivatives result from the Companys investment strategy to economically hedge against interest and foreign exchange risk within the investment portfolio. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, and Financial Condition and Liquidity for a more detailed analysis. Unrealized losses on investments At December 31, 2002, there was $141.9 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed income and short term investments and $86.9 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities. At December 31, 2001, there were $283.9 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed income and short term investments and $70.0 million of gross unrealized losses on equity securities. These losses include securities below investment grade as discussed above. 57 The information shown below about the unrealized losses on the Companys investments at December 31, 2002 concerns the potential affect upon future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of these investments are other than temporary declines. The following is an analysis of how long each of those securities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 had been in a continual unrealized loss position: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Type of Securities Length of time in a continualunrealized loss position Amount ofunrealized loss at December 31, 2002 Amount ofunrealized loss at December 31, 2001 Fixed Income and Short Term Less than six months $ 48,188 $132,599 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 47,502 33,412 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 44,879 48,421 At least 2 years but less than 3 years 610 55,062 At least 3 years but less than 4 years 656 13,946 At least 4 years but less than 5 years 109 At least 5 years but less than 6 years 437 Total $141,944 $283,877 Equities Less than six months $20,972 $35,342 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 62,859 25,180 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 2,672 8,853 At least 2 years but less than 3 years 367 461 At least 3 years but less than 4 years 14 At least 4 years but less than 5 years 93 At least 6 years but less than 7 years 21 Total $86,870 $69,964 The total gross unrealized losses represented approximately 1,250 fixed income securities out of a total of approximately 10,100 fixed income securities and 1,120 equity securities out of a total of approximately 2,000 equity securities at December 31, 2002. The total gross unrealized losses represented approximately 4,500 fixed income securities out of a total of approximately 6,900 and 930 equity securities out of a total of approximately 1,900 at December 31, 2001. As discussed under Investment Structure and Strategy, the Company operates a risk asset portfolio that includes high yield (below investment grade) fixed income securities. These securities have a higher volatility to changes in fair values than investment grade securities. At December 31, 2002, approximately 5.3% of the Companys fixed income investment portfolio was invested in securities which were below investment grade. Approximately 38% of the unrealized losses in the Companys fixed income securities portfolio at December 31, 2002 related to securities that were below investment grade and there were no securities in an unrealized loss position that were not rated. At December 31, 2001, approximately 5.0% of the Companys fixed income investment portfolio was invested in securities that were below 58 investment grade. Approximately 57% of the unrealized losses in the Companys fixed income investment portfolio at December 31, 2001 related to securities that were below investment grade and 4% related to securities that were not rated. The following is an analysis of how long each of these below investment grade and unrated securities had been in a continual unrealized loss position at the date indicated. (U.S. dollars in thousands) Length of time in a continual unrealized loss position Amount of unrealized loss atDecember 31, 2002 Amount of unrealized loss atDecember 31, 2001 Less than six months $12,689 $27,746 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 31,498 96,233 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 25,977 30,831 At least 2 years but less than 3 years 924 7,658 Total $71,088 $162,468 Of the gross unrealized investment losses on the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2002 of $138.9 million, approximately $120.1 million related to corporate fixed income securities. Within the corporate fixed income securities, approximately 26% was in the communications sector, 21% in the energy sector, 20% in the utilities sector, 8% in the financial sector and 7% in the consumer cyclical sector. No other sector was greater than 5%. Approximately 80 equity securities held by the Company with total unrealized losses of approximately $3.0 million at December 31, 2002 were in a continual unrealized loss position for at least 12 months. The largest unrealized loss in the fixed income portfolio was $8.0 million. All other individual fixed income security unrealized losses were less than $5.0 million. The largest individual unrealized loss in the equity portfolio was $1.4 million. Of the gross unrealized investment losses on the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2001 of $280.7 million, approximately $212.4 million related to corporate fixed income securities. Within the corporate fixed income securities, approximately 47% was in the communications sector, 10% in the consumer cyclical sector, 10% in the financial sector and 5% in the basic materials sector. No other sector was greater than 5%. Approximately 120 equity securities held by the Company with total unrealized losses of approximately $9.4 million at December 31, 2001 were in a continual unrealized loss position for at least 12 months. The two largest unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio were individually between $5.0 million and $10.0 million. All other individual fixed income security unrealized losses were less than $5.0 million. The largest individual unrealized loss in our equity portfolio was $3.2 million. A ll other individual equity security losses were less than $1.0 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the following was the maturity profile of the fixed income securities that were in a gross unrealized loss position: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Maturity profile in years of fixed income securities in a continual unrealized loss position Amount of unrealized loss at December 31, 2002 Amount of unrealized loss at December 31, 2001 More than 1 and less than 5 years remaining $22,344 $56,080 More than 5 and less than 10 years remaining 56,250 117,494 More than 10 and less than 20 years remaining 14,969 36,058 20 years or more remaining 34,419 61,358 Mortgage backed securities 10,855 9,733 Total $138,867 $ 280,723 59 Other Revenues and Expenses The following table sets forth other revenues and expenses of the Company for each of the three years ended December 31, 2002 (U.S. dollars in thousands): 2002 % Change 02 vs 01 2001 % Change01 vs 00 2000 Equity in net income of investment affiliates $64,662 (19.8) % $80,580 15.1 % $70,032 Equity in net (loss) income of insurance and operating affiliates (15,976 ) (201.4 )% (5,300 ) (222.6 )% 4,323 Other foreign exchange gains NM NM 55,159 Amortization of intangible assets 6,187 (89.4 )% 58,569 NM 58,597 Corporate operating expenses 115,915 25.5 % 92,355 49.1 % 61,935 Interest expense 168,086 48.4 % 113,272 60.5 % 70,593 Minority interest 13,371 NM 2,113 93.3 % 1,093 Income tax expense (benefit) 22,647 NM (189,914 ) NM (56,356 ) Equity in net income of investment affiliates includes returns from the Companys investments in closed end investment funds, certain limited partnerships and similar investment vehicles. The decrease in 2002 as compared to 2001 is due primarily to lower overall returns in the second and third quarter of 2002 on certain of the Companys investment funds as compared to strong performance of the funds in 2001. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily due to increased returns and additional investment in these funds. Equity in net income of insurance and other operating affiliates in 2002 included a loss of approximately $22.7 million relating to the Companys investment in Annuity and Life Re Holdings Ltd. (Annuity and Life Re). This loss includes a write down of the goodwill component of the Companys investment of $13.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 due to a significant decline in the book value of Annuity and Life Re. While the market value of Annuity and Life Res ordinary shares is lower than its book value, the Company believes its carrying value is appropriate at December 31, 2002, as supported by a discounted cashflow analysis of its underlying contracts performed in conjunction with the U.S. term life contracts novated to the Company from Annuity and Life Re. The Company believes the discounted cash flow analysis is more reliable than the market value as the Company currently has no plans to sell its investment. However, future losses by Annuity and Life Re and the continued depression of its quoted market value may cause the Company to recognize additional losses. Partially offsetting this loss in 2002 is income of $3.5 million relating to FSA International and $1.7 million relating to a new investment made in 2002 in Primus Guaranty, Ltd, which specializes in providing credit risk protection through credit default swaps. In 2001, the equity in net income of insurance and operating affiliates included a loss of $10.9 million related to the Companys share of the loss in Le Mans R, mainly related to the September 11 event in 2001, and $1.6 million in Annuity & Life Re. This loss was partially offset by income related to the Companys share of income from FSA International of $6.7 million. Other foreign exchange gains in 2000 related to the revaluation of a policy benefit reserve denominated in U.K. sterling. The exchange rate movement on the assets matching this policy benefit reserve was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as those assets are designated as available for sale, and in net realized gains on sales of investments. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company reorganized its corporate and operational structure for its U.K. sterling asset accumulation business such that exchange translation adjustments of this nature were largely matched against corresponding investment portfolio movements with minimal exchange rate effect on net income. Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to the adoption of FAS 142, where the Company is no longer required to amortize goodwill. Had FAS 142 been effective on January 1, 2000, the amortization expense would have been approximately $1.1 million and $1.0 million in 60 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in the amortization of intangible assets in 2002 related to the intangible assets acquired in the consolidation of Le Mans R. The Company assessed the carrying value of goodwill as of June 30, 2002 in accordance with FAS 142 and at that time, determined that goodwill assets were unimpaired. The Company continues to review the carrying value related to all of its investments and as further information becomes available, the Company will adjust the carrying value of goodwill as appropriate. Corporate operating expenses increased by 25.5% in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to the continued integration of the Companys global operations and increased costs for Directors and Officers insurance in line with the market in general. In addition, the Company is developing a network of shared service organizations to support operations in certain locations on a centralized basis to improve efficiency over the longer term. This build up of infrastructure, along with the continued integration of the acquired Winterthur International operations, is expected to increase corporate operating expenses in 2003. Corporate operating expenses in 2001 included a charge of $14.0 million related to Winterthur International integration costs and increased infrastructure costs necessary to support the growing worldwide operations of the Company. Corporate operating expenses in 2000 included $5.7 million relating to charges for employee severance and other costs relating to the realignment of Companys operations. The increase in minority interest in 2002 is primarily attributable to the increased profitability of XL Financial Assurance Ltd, for which 15% ownership is held by a third party. The increase in interest expense in 2002 over 2001 primarily reflected an increase in the level of indebtedness. Notes payable and debt were $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This increase reflects a full year of interest on debt issued in 2001 and the issuance of $600.0 million 6.5% Guaranteed senior notes in January 2002 which was used to paydown two 5 year revolving credit facilities of $350.0 million. In addition, interest expense includes $65.9 million and $47.9 million of accretion charge relating to deposit liability transactions for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2001 over 2000 reflects the effect of $1.1 billion of new debt raised by the Company in the second and third quarters of 2001. The continuing existence of the debt at existing interest rates is dependent upon the Companys continued compliance with its debt covenants. For further discussion see the Companys financing structure as outlined in Financial Condition and Liquidity. The change in the Companys income taxes principally reflects the effects of losses arising from the September 11 event and the decline in the profitability of the U.S. operations for each year. Deterioration of the casualty book in 2001 and 2000 resulted in pre tax net losses for U.S. operations, generating an income tax benefit for both years. The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities and under current projections, the Company anticipates using this asset by 2007. The Companys net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2002 is $320.6 million, which consists principally of net operating losses generated by subsidiaries in the U.S. and U.K. Should the taxable income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance may have to be established which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax effected. See Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Condition and Liquidity As a holding company, the Companys assets consist primarily of its investments in subsidiaries and the Companys future cash flows depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries the Company operates in, including, among others, Bermuda, the United States, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and those of the Society of Lloyds and certain contractual provisions. See Item 8, Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. No assurance can be given that the Company or its subsidiaries will be permitted to pay dividends in the future. The Companys ability to underwrite business is largely dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent agencies. The Company regularly provides financial information to these agencies to both maintain and enhance existing ratings. 61 The Companys shareholders equity at December 31, 2002 was $6.6 billion, of which $2.4 billion was retained earnings. Shareholders equity included the issue of 20.7 million Preference Ordinary Shares for net proceeds of $503.6 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 used for general corporate purposes. The Company has had several ordinary share repurchase programs in the past as part of its capital management strategy. On January 9, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized a program for the repurchase of ordinary shares up to $500.0 million. The Company has $135.4 million remaining in its ordinary share repurchase authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2002, no ordinary shares were repurchased in the open market. The Company has repurchased ordinary shares from employees and directors in relation to share swaps on option exercises and withholding tax on restricted stock. As at December 31, 2002, the cumulative currency translation adjustments were $60.4 million. This is shown as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and primarily related to unrealized losses on foreign currency exchange rate movements relating to Winterthur International operations that have a functional currency that is not the U.S. dollar. Financial Condition The Companys balance sheet changed significantly from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 due primarily to the growth of the Companys operations. Inflation can have an effect on the Company in that inflationary factors can increase damage awards and potentially result in larger claims. The Companys underwriting philosophy is to adjust premiums in response to inflation, although this may not always be possible due to competitive pressure. Inflationary factors are considered in determining the premium level on any multi year policies at the time contracts are written. Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves on general operations at December 31, 2002 was $13.2 billion. The Company establishes reserves to provide for estimated claims, the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process and for losses incurred but not reported. These reserves are calculated using actuarial and other reserving techniques to project the estimated ultimate net liability for losses and loss expenses. The Companys reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect managements judgment concerning sound financial practice and does not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claims made against the Companys subsidiaries. No assurance can be given that actual claims made and payments related thereto will not be in excess of the amounts reserved. See Item 1, Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses and Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable increased significantly during 2001 primarily due to the acquisition of Winterthur International and the September 11 event. See Item 8, Notes 6 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverables were $5.0 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001 respectively. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, reinsurance balances receivable were $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion respectively. Of the total unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2002 and 2001 of $6.2 billion, no individual reinsurer accounted for 10% or more of the total. The Company is the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002, collateralizing reinsurance recoverables with respect to certain reinsurers. Included in unpaid loss and loss expenses recoverable at December 31, 2002 is an unsecured, reinsurance recoverable from the Seller of $514.8 million, related to the acquisition of Winterthur International. This amount is subject to ongoing adjustment, and the Seller is currently rated A by Standard and Poors. The SPA provides the Company with post closing protection with respect to adverse development of loss and unearned reserves relating to the acquired Winterthur International business. This protection is based upon actual net loss experience and development over a three year post closing seasoning period based on loss development experience, collectible reinsurance, reinsurance recoveries and certain other factors set forth in the SPA. The SPA provides for arbitration should the Seller and the 62 Company disgree on the final amounts due thereunder. In the event such arbitration is commenced in the future, the Company may recognize an impairment if the amount determined to be due to the Company in such arbitration is considered uncollectible or was less than the carrying value of the SPA recovery balance deemed due from the Seller. An impairment also may result in the event that the Company and the Seller agree on an amount that is less than the amount shown as a recovery in the Companys financial statements or to the extent that any amount proves to be uncollectible from the Seller for any reason. Excluding the recoverable from the Seller described above, approximately 80% of the total unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (excluding collateral held) outstanding at December 31, 2002 were due from reinsurers rated A or better by Standard and Poors. The following is an analysis of the total recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2002 by reinsurers owing more than 3%: Name of reinsurer Standard andPoors rating % of total Swiss Re AA+ 7.6 Lloyds Syndicates A 7.5 Munich Re AA+ 5.1 GE Frankona Ruckversicherungs AA 4.9 London Life and General Reinsurance Company Ltd. * 3.9 Hannover Ruckversicherungs AG AA 3.5 Centre Reinsurance International Company A+ 3.2 * London Life and General Reinsurance Company is rated A by A.M. Best. In addition, at December 31, 2002 approximately $1.8 billion of the total recoverable balance of $6.2 billion related to reinsurance recoverables for the acquired Winterthur International operations. The recoverability of these balances is also guaranteed under the SPA as described above. At December 31, 2001, the largest reinsurance balance receivable and unpaid loss recoverable from a single reinsurer was $355.2 million due from Hannover Re (Ireland) Ltd, and $79.1 million from their affiliate, E+S Reinsurance (Ireland), Ltd, which are both rated A+ by A.M. Best. As at December 31, 2002 and 2001, the reserve for potential non recoveries from reinsurers was $47.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively. Liquidity Certain business written by the Company has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Companys results and operational cash flows. Operational cash flows during 2002 improved compared to 2001 primarily due to growth in premiums written, including life premiums. At December 31, 2002, cash flow had not been negatively affected by the September 11 event as approximately 75% of total incurred losses are in unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at December 31, 2002. The relatively low percentage of paid claims to date is due to the size and complexity of the claims and the fact that approximately 60% of the Companys ultimate incurred losses related to the reinsurance segment where there is an inherent lag between the timing of a loss event and when it is reported by the ceding company. The Company has reviewed the anticipated cash flow from the September 11 event and believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet payments as they come due. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the total amounts of net losses paid from general operations by the Company were $2.8 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The increase in 2002 and 2001 is due to the growth in operations and the acquisition of Winterthur International. In 2002, the Company made the following significant investments: (1) Effective January 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of a 67% majority shareholding in Le Mans R, increasing its shareholding from 49% at December 31, 2001. Cash paid, net of cash acquired, was $45.5 million. An additional $138.5 million is expected to be paid in 2003 to complete the 100% acquisition of this subsidiary. 63 (2) The Company invested a further $717.5 million in alternative investment managers, related investment funds and insurance affiliates. The majority of this amount included four separate investments in funds managed by FrontPoint Partners LLC, an investment in SPhinX Ltd., a fund designed to track an S&P Hedge Fund Index, and an investment in Primus Guaranty, Ltd, which specializes in providing credit risk protection through credit default swaps. The Company has commitments to invest a further $224.1 million over the next five years in alternate investment managers, related investment funds, certain limited partnerships, insurance affiliates, and collateralized debt/equity investments. In connection with the acquisition of Winterthur International, a limited recourse receivables financing facility previously available to these operations from Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company was made available to the Company. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2002 was $338.6 million and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capital resources As at December 31, 2002, the Company had bank, letter of credit and loan facilities available from a variety of sources, including commercial banks, totaling $4.6 billion of which $1.9 billion in debt was outstanding. In addition, $2.5 billion of letters of credit were outstanding as at December 31, 2002, 6.5% of which were collateralized by the Companys investment portfolio, supporting U.S. non admitted business and the Companys Lloyds capital requirements. During 2002 and 2001, borrowings under these facilities were $0.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and repayments under the facilities were $0.6 billion and $50.0 million, respectively. Borrowings in 2002 were used to pay down two 5 year revolvers and for general corporate purposes. Borrowings in 2001 were used to repurchase $66.4 million of the Companys shares and for general corporate purposes. The total pre tax interest expense on notes and debt outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $102.2 million and $65.4 million, respectively. Associated with the Companys bank and loan commitments are various loan covenants with which the Company was in compliance throughout the year ended December 31, 2002. These facilities contain various cross default provisions and covenants, including a minimum rating requirement, as further described below under Cross Defaults and Other Provisions in Debt Documents. The following tables present the Companys indebtedness under outstanding securities and lenders commitments as at December 31, 2002 (U.S. dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Period Notes Payable and Debt Commitment In Use Year ofExpiry Less than 1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After 5 Years 364 day revolver $500,000 $ 2002 $ $ $ $ 7.15% Senior Notes (1) 99,979 99,979 2005 100,000 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes 255,000 255,000 2011 255,000 6.50% Guaranteed Senior Notes (1) 597,123 597,123 2012 600,000 Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures CARZ (1) 625,805 625,805 2021 1,010,833 Liquid Yield Option Notes(TM) LYONs(1) 300,050 300,050 2021 511,351 Total $2,377,957 $1,877,957 $ $100,000 $ $2,377,184 (1) Commitment and In Use data represent December 31, 2002 accreted values. After 5 years data represents ultimate redemption values for 2021. The convertibles may be put or converted by the bondholders at various times prior to the 2021 redemption date. The Company may also choose to call the CARZ and LYONs, from May and September 2004, respectively, onwards. In January 2002, the Company issued $600.0 million par value 6.50% Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2012. The notes were issued at $99.469 and gross proceeds were $596.8 million. Related 64 expenses of the offering amounted to $7.9 million. Proceeds of the notes were used to pay down two 5 year revolvers of a total of $350.0 million and for general corporate purposes. These credit facilities were subsequently cancelled. In August 2002, the Company issued 9.2 million of 8% Series A preference ordinary shares (Series A preference shares). Gross proceeds were $230.0 million and related expenses were $7.2 million. Upon dissolution of the Company, the holders of the Series A preference shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25 per share, plus accrued dividends. Dividends on the preference Shares are cumulative from the date of original issuance and are payable when declared. The Company may redeem the Series A preference shares on or after August 14, 2007, at a redemption price of $25 per share. The Company may, under certain circumstances, redeem the Series A preference shares before August 14, 2007 at specified redemption prices, plus accrued dividends. These circumstances include an amalgamation, consolidation or other similar transaction involving the Company in which the Series A preferred shares are entitled to a class vote ($26 per share redemption price), or a change in tax laws that requires the Company to pay additional amounts with respect to the Series A preference shares ($25 per share redemption price). The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. In November 2002, the Company issued 11.5 million 7 5/8% Series B preference ordinary shares (Series B preference shares). Gross proceeds were $287.5 million and relate expenses were $9.1 million. Upon dissolution of the Company, the holders of the Series B preference shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25 per share, plus accrued dividends. Dividends on the preference shares are cumulative from the date of original issuance and are payable when declared. The Company may redeem the Series A preference ordinary shares on or after November 18, 2007, at a redemption price of $25 per share. The Company may, under certain circumstances, redeem the B preference shares before November 18, 2007 at specified redemption prices, plus accrued dividends. These circumstances include an amalgamation, consolidation or other similar transaction involving the Company in which the Series B preferred shares are entitled to a class vote ($26 per share redemption price), or a change in tax laws that requires the Company to pay additional amounts with respect to the Series B preference shares ($25 per share redemption price). The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The following table presents, as at December 31, 2002, the Companys letter of credit facilities available, in use and when those facilities are due to expire. (U.S. dollars in thousands): Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Year of Less than 1 to 3 4 to 5 After 5 Commitments Commitment In Use Expiry 1 Year Years Years Years Letter of credit facilities (1) $ 2,744,051 $ 2,462,544 2003 $ 2,744,051 (1) Of the total letter of credit facilities above, $500.0 million is included in the 364 day revolver under notes payable and debt commitments. The Company has several letter of credit facilities provided on a syndicated and bilateral basis from commercial banks. These facilities (as well as the off balance sheet collateral arrangement described below) are utilized to support non admitted insurance and reinsurance operations in the U.S. and capital requirements at Lloyds. All of the commercial facilities are scheduled for renewal during 2003. In addition to letters of credit, the Company has established insurance trusts in the U.S. that provide cedents with statutory relief required under state insurance regulation in the U.S. It is anticipated that the commercial facilities will be renewed on expiry but such renewals are subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by the Company. In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedents. This could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by the Companys investment portfolio or funds withheld using the Companys cash resources. The value of letters of credit required is driven by, among other things, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business. 65 On June 27, 2002, the Company renewed its principal 364 day letter of credit and credit facility. The combined capacity of the new facility is $2.0 billion of which up to $500.0 million is available in the form of revolving credit. On July 24, 2002, the Company replaced letters of credit provided by the previous owner of the Winterthur International operations with letters of credit issued from its 364 day facility. During September 2002, the Company canceled a secured $150.0 million letter of credit facility that had been unutilized. In November 2002, the Company renewed its unsecured syndicated letter of credit facility that supports its operations at Lloyds. The renewed facility is denominated in U.K. sterling and is approximately $500.0 million at December 31, 2002. Also included in the table above are two secured letter of credit facilities utilized by Le Mans R. The Company entered into a new $100.0 million letter of credit facility in January 2003. In February 2003, the Company entered into an aggregate of $300.0 million of commercial paper based credit facilities (the Credit Facilities) and expects to increase these facilities to $500.0 million later in 2003. The proceeds of advances under the Credit Facilities were used to fund a trust account (Trust) to collateralize the reinsurance obligations of the Company under an intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement. The Companys repayment obligations under the Credit Facilities are collateralized by securities deposited into one or more segregated accounts over which the agent under the Credit Facilities has a fully perfected first priority security interest. The Companys obligations under the Credit Facilities prior to the stated maturity of February 25, 2007 if certain events occur, including the insolvency of the Company, the withdrawal of assets from the Trust by the ceding company, the downgrade of the Companys credit ratings below certain specified levels, the failure of the agent to have a first priority perfected security interest in the collateral posted by the Company and various other customary default provisions. At maturity, the Company will be obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the principal and accrued interest outstanding under the Credit Facilities. The Company intends for the Trust to invest in securities issued by one or more of the lenders under the Credit Facilities (provided that such securities qualify for inclusion in the Trust) and the Company has the right, and the intention, to offset these lender issued securities against the Companys repayment obligations under the Credit Facilities. The issued securities and the Companys repayment obligations will be recorded as a net balance on the Companys balance sheet. In the event that in the future the Company were to not have the right to offset such assets (as, for example, would be the case if the assets in the Trust were withdrawn in order to satisfy the Companys reinsurance obligations or if lender issued securities could not be held in the Trust because they did not qualify as permitted assets under the trust agreement), then all or a portion of the assets in the Trust and the Companys repayment obligations under the Credit Facilities would be required to be included as assets and liabilities on a gross basis, respectively, on the Companys balance sheet. The Company reviews current and projected collateral requirements on a regular basis, as well as new sources of collateral. Managements objective is to maintain an excess amount of collateral sources over expected uses. The Company also reviews its liquidity needs on a regular basis. Convertible Debt Securities In 2001, the Company issued two convertible debt securities as further described below and in the indentures relating to such bonds. These bonds carry a zero coupon, meaning that, under normal circumstances, the Company is not required to pay cash interest at any time during the life of the bonds or at maturity. In May 2001, the Company issued $1,010.8 million principal amount at maturity (subject to adjustment in the event there is an upward interest adjustment) of CARZ at $593.57 per bond and, unless converted or repaid before their due date of May 2021, they will be repaid in May 2021 at $1,000 per bond, at a total cost of $1.01 billion. The accretion rate is 2.625% per annum on a semi annual basis or 2.6422% per annum on an annual basis. In September 2001, the Company also issued $508.8 million principal amount at maturity (subsequently increased to $511.4 million under the provisions of the upward accretion rate adjustment described below) of LYONs at an initial price of $565.01 per bond. The LYONs will be repaid at $1,004.93 each (originally $1,000.00 each but subsequently increased as a result of the accretion rate adjustment described below) unless converted or repaid before their due date of September 2021, at a total cost of $511.4 million. The accretion rate on the LYONs was originally 2.875% per annum on a semi annual basis or 66 2.89566% per annum on an annual basis. The accretion rate for the year to September 7, 2003, was increased by 0.5% per annum on a semi annual basis to 3.375% per annum on a semi annual basis and 3.403% per annum on an annual basis as a result of the Companys ordinary share price in the 30 day period leading up to the first put date in September 2002. The accretion rates will revert to their original rates in September 2003 unless the contingent additional accretion feature is once again triggered by the Companys ordinary share price performance in a 30 day period leading up to the second put date. Although both the CARZ and LYONs are due to be repaid in 2021, there are several features that may result in the bonds being repaid or converted into the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares before the redemption date. As these features include market driven features and options available to the Company and bondholders, it is not possible to determine if the bonds will remai n outstanding until their scheduled maturity in 2021. Each of the CARZ and LYONs provide the bondholders the right to require the Company to repurchase the bonds on predetermined dates (put dates) at predetermined values as set forth in the relevant indenture. The remaining put dates for the CARZ occur on May 23 of 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2016. The remaining put dates for the LYONs occur on September 7 of 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2016. The Company may, at its option, pay the repurchase price in cash or Class A ordinary shares or a combination thereof. In addition, each of the CARZ and LYONs provide for a contingent conversion feature that gives the bondholders the right to convert the bonds into the Companys shares at other times during the life of the bonds if the market price of the Companys shares is at certain levels. Accordingly, if the Companys ordinary share price is at least 110% of the accreted conversion price for at least twenty of the thirty days during the relevant conversion period, the bondholders would have the right to convert the bonds into ordinary shares. If converted for ordinary shares, each CARZ would be converted into 5.9467 ordinary shares and each holder of a LYONs would receive 5.277 ordinary shares. The accreted values would be determined by applying the accretion rate to the initial issue price. In the example of CARZ, the accreted price on May 23, 2003 will be $625.36 determined by adding two years accretion of 2.6422% per annum on an annual basis to the original issue price of $593.57. The holders of each of the CARZ and LYONs also have the right to convert the bonds for ordinary shares in the event that the trading price of the bonds for a predetermined period falls below 95% of the value of the equivalent number of shares, provided however, if the ordinary shares are trading at a predetermined premium to the accreted price of the bonds, holders may receive cash, ordinary shares or a combination thereof in lieu of ordinary shares upon conversion. These bonds also provide for interest rates to be adjusted in the event that the Companys ordinary share price falls below certain levels specified in the relevant indenture relative to the conversion price. In addition, in the event that the credit ratings assigned to the bonds by S&Ps fall below BBB+, the bonds would be convertible into ordinary shares at 5.9467 ordinary shares per CARZ and 5.277 ordinary shares per LYONs. The rating assigned to the bonds at the time of issue was A+. Some corporate transactions, such as a change of control of the Company, would give the bondholders the right to require the Company to repurchase the bonds at the accreted value of the bonds at that time. The bonds become immediately due if an event of default occurs and 25% or more of the bondholders demand repayment of the accreted value at the time of such event. Such an event of default would include failure to pay amounts due on the notes, an event of default occurring under the Companys other credit facilities, or certain other events such as bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. Further descriptions of the events of default are contained in the indentures and consequences to the Company are described under Cross Default and Other Provisions in Debt Documents. The bonds are also callable as the Company has the right to redeem the bonds for cash, in full or in part, at their accreted value at any time after May 23, 2004, in the case of the CARZ, and September 7, 2004, in the case of the LYONs. The puts and the interest rate adjustment features embedded in the CARZ and LYONs are considered derivatives and are subject to fair value. There is currently minimal value ascribed to the puts, as the 67 contingent events of these features are considered unlikely to occur or to the interest rate adjustment feature due to the current trading value of the bonds. Due to the contingent nature of the conversion features of these debt securities, there is no impact on fully diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share at this time. Cross Default and Other Provisions in Debt Documents The following describes certain terms of the documents referred to below. All documents referred to below have been filed with the SEC and should be referred to for an assessment of the complete contractual obligations of the Company. In general, all of the Companys bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Companys outstanding indebtedness, including the Credit Facilities discussed above (collectively, the Companys Debt Documents), as described above, contain cross default provisions to each other and the Companys Debt Documents (other than the LYONs, CARZ and 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures) contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, among other things, minimum required ratings of the Companys insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries (other than its AAA financial guaranty companies) and the level of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generally each of the Companys Debt Documents provide for an event of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or some events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. The Companys credit facilities and the 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes also contain minimum consolidated net worth covenants. Under the Companys 364 day facility and ten year private placement notes described above, in the event that the Company fails to maintain a claims paying rating of at least A from A.M. Best or the Companys insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries (other than its AAA financial guaranty companies) fail to maintain a rating of at least A from S&P, an event of default would occur. Each of the LYONs, CARZ and 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures contains a cross default provision. In general, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $50.0 million or more, an event of default would be triggered under both the LYONs and 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures. Under the CARZ indenture, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $100 million or more, an event of default would be triggered. Given that all of the Companys Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due and payable and an acceleration of all debt due under those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness. In addition, the Companys unsecured Lloyds letter of credit facility provides that, in the event that the Companys insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries fall below A (as generally measured by the lower of the financial strength rating from A.M. Best or S&P at any time), the facility would then be required to be fully secured by the Company, at which time the Company would be required to either (i) provide an amount in cash to cover an amount equal to the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time or (ii) deposit assets in trust securing 105% of the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time. If this were to occur, the Company may not be able to provide the collateral required in order to maintain this facility. Long Term Contractual Obligations The following table presents the Companys long term contractual obligations and related payments as at December 31, 2002, due by period. This table excludes further commitments of $224.1 million to the Companys alternate investment managers, related investment funds, certain limited partnerships, insurance affiliates, collateralized debt/equity investments, and letter of credit facilities of $2.7 million. See Item 8, Note 14 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 68 (U.S. dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 less than3 years 3 less than 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt obligations (1) $2,477,184 $ $100,000 $ $2,377,184 Operating lease obligations 268,951 28,141 50,924 43,996 145,890 Total $2,746,135 $28,141 $150,924 $43,996 $2,523,074 (1) The long term debt obligations include the ultimate redemption values on the CARZ and LYONs up to 2021 and therefore the total obligation amount is greater than the current notes payable and debt outstanding at December 31, 2002. See Item 8, Note 14 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Variable Interest Entities and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company utilizes variable interest entities both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of the Companys business. At the transactional level, the Company provides various forms of credit enhancement including financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance of structured transactions backed by pools of assets of specified types, municipal obligations supported by the issuers ability to charge fees for specified services or projects, and structured single risk based obligations including essential infrastructure projects and obligations backed by receivables from future sales of commodities and other specified services. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized through variable interest entities. In synthetic transactions, the Company guarantees payment obligations of counterparties including special purpose vehicles under credit default swaps referencing asset portfolios. The Company only provides financial guaranty insurance or enters into a credit default swap in respect of the senior interests that would otherwise be rated investment grade. The Company does not hold any equity positions or subordinated debt in these arrangements. Accordingly, the Company does not consider its participation to be a significant variable interest in the entity and therefore these variable interest entities are not expected to be consolidated. In February 2003, the Company entered into an aggregate of $300.0 million of commercial paper based credit facilities (the Credit Facilities) and expects to increase these facilities to $500.0 million later in 2003. The proceeds of advances under the Credit Facilities were used to fund a trust account (Trust) to collateralize the reinsurance obligations of the Company under an intercompany quota share reinsurance agreement. The issued securities and the Companys repayment obligations will be recorded as a net balance on the Companys balance sheet because the Company has a contractual legal right of offset. In the event that in the future the Company were to not have the right to offset such assets (as, for example, would be the case if the assets in the Trust were withdrawn in order to satisfy the Companys reinsurance obligations or if lender issued securities could not be held in the Trust because they did not qualify as permitted assets under the trust agreement), then all or a portion of the assets in the Trust and the Companys repayment obligations under the Credit Facilities would be required to be included as assets and liabilities on a gross basis, respectively, on the Companys balance sheet. See also Financial Condition and Liquidity for more details regarding this off balance sheet collateral arrangement. The Company may be required to consolidate up to $2.4 billion of assets and liabilities (commencing in the third quarter of 2003) relating to the following variable interest entities due to the level of variable interest retained by the Company and its related parties. Management is assessing alternatives with regards to restructuring these entities in order to mitigate this result and any impact on its financial covenants. The Company has an investment in an asset backed commercial paper conduit that invests funds provided through a commercial paper and a Euro Medium Term Note program. The assets of this company are guaranteed by an unrelated third party, subject to a $25.0 million deductible. The Company has invested in a $30.0 million subordinate note which is the Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with this variable interest entity. The Company could experience a loss in the event that the 69 assets of the underlying commercial paper conduit do not perform as expected. The investment company has assets and liabilities of approximately $950.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The Company provides insurance, reinsurance and a liquidity facility to a variable interest entity domiciled in the Cayman Islands of which the Company has 23% of the share capital. The variable interest entity was established primarily as a pass through vehicle associated with a Medium Term Note program backed by a portfolio of investment grade bank perpetual securities and zero coupon notes. The variable interest entity had assets of approximately $715.0 million as at December 31, 2002. The Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its insurance and reinsurance agreements with this variable interest entity is $544.1 million as of December 31, 2002. The Company could experience a loss in the event that the underlying assets do not perform as expected. The Company has a residual interest in an asset backed securities collateralized bond obligation (CBO). The CBO had assets of $304.9 million and liabilities of $289.4 million as of December 31, 2002. Through the Companys investment in the CBOs preferred shares, the Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investment in this variable interest entity was $3.3 million as of December 31, 2002. The Company also has indirect exposure to loss through its investment in affiliates. The Company could experience a loss in the event that the cash flows relating to the underlying assets are not collected as expected. The Company has an investment in the junior notes of a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). The Company also issued financial guaranties for the senior notes of the CDO. As of December 31, 2002, the CDO had assets of $452.7 million and liabilities of $395.6 million and the Companys maximum exposure to loss as a result of its financial guaranties and investment in this variable interest entity was approximately $425.0 million. The Company could experience a loss in the event that the cash flows relating to the underlying assets are not collected as expected. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8, Note 2(s) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements. Current Outlook The worldwide property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive. The Company generally competes on the basis of financial strength, coverage terms, claims paying rating and reputation, price and customer service. The markets for the Companys insurance and reinsurance products are characterized by strong and, at times, intense price competition. Although most of the property and casualty markets in which the Company operates have seen substantial improvements in pricing and policy terms and conditions in 2002, asset defaults and devaluations as well as adverse reserve development have caused erosion of the balance sheets of many global insurers and reinsurers. This has led to downgrades for some of the strongest reinsurers and outright market withdrawals by others. This reduction in the capital supply has contributed to price increases coupled with coverage restrictions and has led to the entrance of new capital in the form of new companies, risk securitization and alternative carriers. The Company believes that competitive forces will continue to be present in the industry. Some of the Companys competitors possess significantly greater financial and other resources than the Company. The Company believes that premium rate increases and favorable terms and conditions will remain for the near term for most lines of property and casualty business that the Company writes. This is based on a number of factors, including continued large loss activity in the insurance industry; reduced capacity for major insurers and reinsurers due to the decline in the world equity markets and lower interest rates; legacy losses such as asbestos that continue to affect the industry; and rating agency downgrades of competitors. In addition, the Company believes that its global presence and current AA financial strength rating from S&P for its property and casualty subsidiaries gives the Company a competitive advantage. 70 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company enters into derivatives and other financial instruments primarily for risk management purposes. The Companys derivative transactions can expose the company to credit default swap risk, weather and energy risk, investment market risk, and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company attempts to manage these risks based on guidelines established by senior management. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value with the resulting changes in fair value recognized in income in the period in which they occur. 71 The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and value at risk (VaR) analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Credit Default Swap Risk The Company enters into swaps written under ISDA forms in its insurance and financial products and services segments as an extension of its financial guaranty business. The fair value is determined using models developed by the Company and is dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, future default rates, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. Other elements of the change in fair value are based upon pricing established at the inception of the contract. A change in the interest, default and recovery rate assumptions would cause the fair value associated with credit default swaps to decrease as follows: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Assumptions % Change Decrease in Fair Value Interest rate 1% decrease $2,447 Default rate 10% increase $5,797 Recovery rate 10% decrease $5,720 Weather and Energy Risk The Company offers weather and energy risk management products in insurance or derivative form to end users, while managing the risks in the over the counter and exchange traded derivatives markets. In addition to entering into transactions with end users, (which represents the majority of the Company weather and energy derivative transactions) the Company also maintains a smaller weather and energy derivatives trading portfolio. As of the year ended December 31, 2002, a majority of the Companys outstanding weather transactions were due to mature on or before December 31, 2003. During 2002, the Company initiated a limited trading portfolio of listed natural gas futures and options and over the counter contracts with similar terms to support its anticipated offering of energy risk management products to end users in 2003. Fair value for the Companys natural gas contracts are determined through the use of quoted market prices. As quoted market prices are not widely available in the weather derivative market, management uses available market data and internal pricing models based upon consistent statistical methodologies to estimate fair values. Estimating fair value of instruments which do not have quoted market prices requires management judgment in determining amounts which could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in settlement of the contracts. The amounts could be materially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect managements best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, realized and forecasted weather conditions, changes in interest rates and other market factors. 72 The following table summarizes the movement in the fair value of contracts outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2002: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Unrealized gain (loss) Fair value of contacts outstanding, beginning of the year $(1,104 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled (4,891 ) Fair value of new contracts (2,375 ) Other changes in fair value 2,346 Fair value of contracts outstanding, end of year $(6,024 ) The following table summarizes the maturity of contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Source of Fair Value Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Greaterthan 5Years Total FairValue Prices actively quoted $(14,321 ) $(578 ) $ $ $(14,899 ) Prices based on models and other valuation methods (2,900 ) 6,092 4,316 1,367 8,875 Total fair value of contracts outstanding $(17,221 ) $5,514 $4,316 $1,367 $(6,024 ) 73 Market Risk Market risk for the Companys commodity portfolio relates to changes in underlying weather conditions (i.e., changes in climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation) and to a lesser extent, natural gas prices. The Company has underwritten risks in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, with its primary market risk reflected in temperature changes within the United States and Europe. The Company manages its weather risk portfolio through the employment of a variety of strategies. These include geographical and directional diversification of risk exposures and direct hedging within the capital and reinsurance markets. Risk management is undertaken on a portfolio wide basis, to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well diversified and which remains within the aggregate risk tolerance established by the Companys senior management. Value At Risk A statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools used by management to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of the Companys weather risk and natural gas portfolios. VaR, as it relates to commodity risk, is at the 99% confidence level. The Company estimates VaR based on the historical simulation of each of the seasonal books into which weather transactions are segregated. Currently, the Companys VaR calculation does not exceed $60 million in any one season. The Companys high, low and average aggregate seasonal VaR amounts assumed over all future seasons during 2002 were $201.3 million, $25.8 million and $102.7 million, respectively. The Companys high, low and average aggregate seasonal VaR amounts during 2001 were $48.6 million, $4.7 million and $30.1 million, respectively. The summation of all future seasons equals the aggregate portfolio VaR, although this is not a statisitc utilized by management because current weather events and patterns are generally independent of, and have an immaterial effect on, expectations for future seasons (and once a season ends, the associated VaR is zero for the remainder of the fiscal year). Therefore, the Company could reduce or eliminate its VaR on futu re seasons by selling its positions prior to the beginning of a season. Since VaR statistics are estimates based on simulations of historical market data, VaR should not be viewed as an absolute, prognostic measurement gauge of future financial performance or as a way for the Company to predict risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual future losses will not exceed its VaR amounts. The Company also maintains VaR limits set by management for natural gas contracts, that had a daily VaR limit of $3.5 million during 2002. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit risk, or the risk that counterparties to weather and energy transactions will fail to perform their contractual obligations leading to possible losses. In order to control its risk exposures, the Company has implemented a credit risk control framework centered on a management credit committee, credit policies and credit limits developed, enhanced and maintained by a credit officer and a credit committee comprised of senior management. All credit sensitive transactions are reviewed and approved by the Companys risk management personnel and or credit committee and exposures are reviewed with respect to authorized credit limits before the Company enters into weather derivative transactions. To address counterparty risk concerns and to support credit exposures in certain cases, the Company may require that a counterparty provide a guaranty or a letter of credit or post margin or collateral. The Company monitors its credit exposures on a daily basis to ensure adherence to all policies and limits. Operational Risk Operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Companys weather and energy risk trading operations, including, but not limited to, improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions, deficiencies in the Companys operating systems, and inadequacies or breaches in the Companys control procedures and processes. The Company relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process its 74 transactions, but in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees, the Company could suffer, among other things, financial loss, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage or other material adverse consequences. In order to mitigate and control its operational risk, the Company has developed and continues to enhance and audit specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels. For example, the Company has implemented procedures that require that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected in the Companys books and records, including reconciliation of trade entry and confirmation and regular crosschecks with counterparties. Critical IT systems are backed up on a daily basis. The Company also uses periodic self assessments and internal audit reviews as a further check on operational risk. Moreover, trading position valuations and other trading processes and procedures are subject to periodic review. Legal Risk Legal risk is largely comprised of the risk that a derivative transaction will not be properly documented or executed. Proper documentation is critical to assure not only that a counterparty has the authority to enter into the transaction, but also that the transaction is enforceable as negotiated between parties and among other items, are excluded from preferential transfer provisions in the event of counterparty insolvency. As a result, the Company obtains an executed International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. (ISDA) Master Agreement or a form of confirmation which incorporates by reference the ISDA Master Agreement and certain elective provisions of the Schedule. The ISDA Master Agreement Schedule adopted and periodically enhanced by the Company incorporates, among other provisions, the following contractual protections: the netting of transactions between the Company and the counterparty; a right of set off for the Company; a representations and warranties provision; and a customized event of default and termination section (typically based upon credit ratings downgrades identified by the Companys risk management department). Further contractual protections and legal documentation may be required when the Company enters into a derivative transaction with a non U.S. counterparty. The Company seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage its market, credit, operational and legal risks in accordance with defined policies and procedures. The Companys senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed and implemented policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of the various risks within the business. Due to the changing nature of the global marketplace, the Companys risk management policies, procedures and methodologies are constantly evolving and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Market, credit, operational, legal and other risks are inherent in the Companys weather risk management business and cannot be wholly eliminated despite the Companys risk management policies, procedures and methodologies. The Company anticipates that further regulation of weather and energy derivative contracts is reasonably likely to occur based upon recent events and failures in the energy market. Based upon the evolving regulatory developments in energy trading, the Company will continue to monitor and enhance its market, credit, operational and legal procedures and processes to comply with future regulation. Investment Market Risk The Companys investment portfolio is managed by external investment professionals under the direction of the Companys management and in accordance with detailed investment guidelines provided and monitored by the Company on a frequent basis. Managers are selected directly by the Company on the basis of various criteria, including investment style, track record, performance, internal controls, operational risk, and diversification implications. The vast majority of the Companys investment portfolio is managed by well established, large institutional investment professionals. 75 The Companys investment portfolio consists of exposures to fixed income securities, equities, alternative investments, derivatives, business and other investments, and cash. These securities and investments are denominated in both U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. Through the structure of the Companys investment portfolio, the Companys earnings are directly affected by changes in the valuations of the securities and investments held in the investment portfolio. These valuation changes reflect changes in interest rates (e.g. changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curves, volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads), credit quality, equity prices (e.g. changes in prices and volatilities of individual securities, equity baskets and equity indices) and foreign currency exchange rates (e.g. changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates). Market risk therefore arises due to the uncertainty surrounding the future valuations of these different assets, the factors that impact their values and the impact that this could have on the Companys earnings. The Company seeks to manage the risks of the investment portfolio through a combination of asset class, country, industry and security level diversification and investment manager allocations. Further, individual security and issuer exposures are controlled and monitored at the investment portfolio level, via specific investment constraints outlined in investment guidelines and agreed with the external investment professionals. Additional constraints are agreed with the external investment professionals which may address exposures to eligible securities, prohibited investments/transactions, credit quality and general concentrations limits. The Companys direct use of investment derivatives includes futures, forwards, swaps and option contracts that derive their value from underlying assets, indices, references rates or a combination of these factors. When investment guidelines allow for the use of derivatives, these can generally only be used for the purposes of managing interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk, provided the use of such instruments are incorporated in the overall portfolio duration, spread, convexity and other relevant portfolio metrics. The direct use of derivatives is not permitted to economically leverage the portfolio outside of the stated guidelines. Derivatives may also be used to add value to the investment portfolio where market inefficiencies are perceived to exist, to utilize cash holdings to purchase equity indexed derivatives and to adjust the duration of a portfolio of fixed income securities to match the duration of related deposit liabilities. Investment Value At Risk Central to the Companys market risk management framework is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a statistical risk measure, calculating the level of potential losses that could be expected to be exceeded, over a specified holding period and at a given level of confidence, in normal market conditions, due to adverse movements in the investment portfolios underlying securities and investments valuations. The Company calculates the VaR of the investment portfolio using a 1 month time horizon and a 95% level of confidence. This means that, on average, the Company could expect losses greater than predicted by the VaR results 5% of the time, or once every 20 months. The calculation of VaR is performed monthly using a full valuation based on the Monte Carlo approach and it is expressed both in terms of U.S. dollars and as a percentage of the Companys investment portfolio. The modeling of the risk of any portfolio, as measured by VaR, involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While the Company believes that its assumptions and approximations are appropriate, there is no uniform industry methodology for calculating VaR. The Company notes that different VaR results can be produced for the same portfolio dependent, not only on the approach used but also on the assumptions employed when implementing the approach. However, in order to maintain meaningful and comparable VaR results over time, the Company has maintained the same assumptions and approximations in its methodology over the period. The VaR approach uses historical data to determine the sensitivity of each of the underlying securities to the risk factors incorporated into the models that are employed in the Monte Carlo simulations. In calculating these sensitivities, greater importance is placed on the more recent data points and information. Since the VaR approach is based on historical positions and market data, VaR results should not be viewed 76 as an absolute and predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for the company to predict risk. There is no assurance that the Companys actual future losses will not exceed its VaR and the Company expects that 5% of the time the VaR will be exceeded. Additionally, the Company acknowledges the fact that risks associated with abnormal market events can be significantly different to the VaR results and these are by definition not reflected or assessed in the VaR analysis. The VaR of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2002 was approximately $236.0 million. The VaR of all investment related derivatives excluding investments in affiliates and other investments was $6.0 million. In instances where the data or time series is insufficient to determine the risk factor sensitivities, the VaR approach uses proxy time series data available for similar instruments. As at December 31, 2002, approximately $5.2 billion (28% of the Companys investment portfolio at market value) was proxied. Approximately $1.4 billion related to various fixed income portfolios, $1.3 billion to alternative investments and $780.0 million to various cash portfolios. Also there were 91 ($28.5 million) holdings not proxied and excluded from the VaR calculations because they could not be easily proxied because they could not be modeled. The Company reviews the proxies to ensure that an appropriate data and time series is being used in the calculations and that the proxies used are conservative. The following two tables show the Companys average, minimum and maximum VaR in percentage and dollar terms for the total investment portfolio during 2002, based upon the VaR at quarter end dates. They also include the Companys VaR in percentage and dollar terms for the total investment portfolio as at December 31, 2002. The Companys investment portfolio VaR as at December 31, 2002 is not necessarily indicative of future VaR levels.

(2) The majority of the Companys alternative investment portfolio is accounted for as equity in affiliates. However, for purposes of monitoring and tracking the Companys total investment market risk, the total alternative investment portfolio is included in these calculations. The alternative investment portfolio is principally proxied to the public equity markets and fixed income markets in these VaR calculations. The actual annualized volatility of the Companys alternatives portfolio during 2002 was 2.4% versus approximately 21% for the public equity markets and approximately 4% for the fixed income markets, as proxied by the S&P500 Index and Lehman Aggregate Bond Index, respectively. (3) Total undiversified VaR is the summation of the individual VaRs for each of the separate asset classes and by construction ignores any and all correlations between the different asset classes. The total undiversified VaR therefore ignores diversification benefits that exist in between these different asset classes. (4) Diversification VaR equals the difference between the investment portfolios total portfolio VaR and the total undiversified VaR. As the former explicitly accounts for the correlations and diversification benefits that exist between the actual asset classes and the latter explicitly does not, the difference in the two VaR results must be due to the diversification benefits. These diversification benefits arise due to the risk reduction that occurs when different assets, that are not perfectly correlated, are combined in a portfolio. It will vary over time dependent on: allocations changes; changes in the correlations between the different asset classes; and changes in the general asset class risks. The NA reflects the fact that since the minimum and maximum VaR for the six different asset class portfolios do not refer to the same point in time and therefore it is not meaningful to calculate the diversification VaR.  (5) Total investment portfolio VaR is the Companys investment portfolio VaR based on the prescribed methodology that explicitly accounts for the diversification benefits that occur when each of the allocations to the individual asset classes are included in the investment portfolio. (6) Based on a 95% confidence level with a one month holding period, expressed in millions of US$ Dollars. The Companys total investment portfolio VaR is driven by: the size of the overall investment portfolio; the size of the allocations to the different asset classes and securities in the asset classes; the risks associated with each of the asset classes and securities; and the correlations and diversification benefits between each of the asset classes and securities. Changes in any of these variables will have a direct impact on the Companys VaR. The Companys total undiversified VaR, which ignores any correlation and diversification benefits, at December 31, 2002 was 2.52% compared to a maximum of 3.13% and a minimum of 1.98%. The Companys average diversification VaR during 2002 resulted in an average reduction of the Companys total undiversified VaR of 1.04% and as at December 31, 2002 was 1.28%. The Companys total investment portfolio VaR was on average 1.48% during 2002 and as at December 31, 2002, was 1.24%. The Companys maximum and minimum total investment portfolio VaR during 2002 were 1.78% and 1.21%, respectively. The Companys largest VaR exposure during 2002 was to fixed income. The average VaR for fixed income was 1.68%, compared to a maximum of 2.0% and a minimum of 1.29%. As at December 31, 2002, the fixed income VaR was 1.60%. At December 31 2002, the ranking for the Companys asset class risk, based on the individual asset class VaRs, was: fixed income; alternative investments; equity; business and other investments; cash equivalents and derivatives. Stress Testing VaR does not provide the means to estimate the magnitude of the loss in the 5% of occurrences that the Company expects the VaR level to be exceeded. To complement the VaR analysis based on normal market environments, the Company considers the impact on the investment portfolio in several different historical stress periods to analyse the effect of unusual market conditions. The Company establishes certain historical stress test scenarios which are applied to the actual investment portfolio. As these stress tests and estimated gains and losses are based on historical events, they will not necessarily reflect future stress events or gains and losses from such events. The results of the stress test scenarios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they reflect current shareholders equity, market conditions and the Companys total risk profile. The table below shows the maximum impact on the Companys investment portfolio if all events stress tested were to repeat themselves, given the actual investment portfolios allocations at quarter end dates during 2002. The Company assumes that no action is taken during the stress period to either liquidate or rebalance the portfolio. The Company believes that this fairly reflects the potential decreased liquidity that is often associated with stressed market environments. 78 Stress Test As at March 31,2002 As at June 30,2002 As at September 30,2002 As at December 31,2002 Maximum loss impact on portfolio (7.6)% (5.4)% (4.3)% (4.7)% Maximum gain impact on portfolio 21.4% 21.4% 13.9% 14.9% From the different scenarios that the Company analyses, the largest downside event risk exposure during 2002 was 7.6%, based on the investment portfolio as at March 31, 2002. The largest upside risk exposure during 2002 was 21.4% as at March 31 and June 30, 2002. Given the investment portfolio allocations as at 31 December 2002, the Company would expect to lose approximately 4.7% of the portfolio if the most damaging event stress tested was repeated, all other things held equal. Given the investment portfolio allocations as at 31 December 2002, the Company would expect to gain approximately 14.9% of the portfolio if the most favorable event stress tested was repeated, all other things held equal. Investment Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit risk through its portfolio of debt securities which has historically been a significant exposure in the investment portfolio. The Company controls credit risk in the investment portfolio through the credit research performed by the external investment professionals and limitations on the investment portfolios exposure to individual credits, as set by the Company. Limits are set for each credit rating and are a function of the probability of default and the expected loss in the event of default. Limits ensure that losses from individual defaults should not exceed predetermined levels. The Company reviews on a regular basis its corporate debt concentration, credit quality and compliance with credit limits. Any obligor over its credit limits or experiencing material credit quality deterioration is placed on a Watch List for closer monitoring. Where appropriate, holdings will be reduced. As at December 31, 2002, the average credit quality of the Companys total fixed income portfolio, which includes fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased, was AA. The Companys total fixed income portfolio credit quality breakdown as at December 31, 2002 is shown in the following table . Rating Percentage of Total Fixed Income Exposure(1) AAA 59.8% AA 12.2% A 14.7% BBB 8.0% BB and Below 5.3% (1) Portfolio includes fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased. Individual corporate holdings in the portfolio are diversified, exceeding 900 separate issuer exposures. As at December 31, 2002, the top 10 corporate exposures represented approximately 5.1% of the total fixed income portfolio (excluding operating cash balances) and approximately 14% of the corporate holdings. The top 10 corporate holdings listed below utilizes a conservative approach to aggregation as it includes unsecured as well as securetized, credit enhanced and collateralized securities issued by parent companies and their affiliates. 79 Top 10 Corporate Exposures(1) Percentage of Total Fixed Income Exposure JPMorgan Chase 0.73% Citigroup 0.72% Ford 0.69% General Electric 0.61% Credit Suisse Group 0.57% Daimler Chrysler 0.47% Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 0.35% Verizon 0.34% Comcast Corp. 0.33% Bank One 0.33% (1) Corporate exposures include parent and affiliated companies that issue fixed income securities. In some cases a portion of the market value may be invested in bonds that are securitized or have sufficient credit enhancement that provides a long term credit rating that is higher than the rating of the unsecured debt of the parent company. Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk The Company believes that VaR is an appropriate indicator of the risk of the portfolio, however an immediate 100 basis point adverse shift in global treasury government bond curves would result in a decrease in total return of 5.2% or $754.0 million in the Companys fixed income portfolio as of December 31, 2002. It is unlikely that all global yield curves would shift at the same time. In evaluating the impact of price changes in the equity portfolio, a 10% change in equity prices would affect total return by approximately $57.0 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, bond and stock index futures outstanding were $263.5 million with underlying investments having a market value of $831.9 million. Losses of $1.1 million were realized on these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2002. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of these derivative instruments would have resulted in realized gains and realized losses of $26.3 million respectively. The Company reduces its exposure to these futures through offsetting transactions, including options and forwards. In addition, the Company has short term debt and long term debt outstanding. Interest rates on short term debt are LIBOR based. Accordingly, any changes in interest rates will affect interest expense. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the effects of fluctuating foreign currencies on the value of certain of its foreign currency fixed maturities and equity investments. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purposes and therefore, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. These contracts generally have maturities of three months or less. At December 31, 2002, forward foreign exchange contracts with notional principal amounts totaling $30.2 million were outstanding. The fair value of these contracts as at December 31, 2002 was $28.6 million with unrealized losses of $1.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, realized losses of $3.4 million and unrealized losses of $0.8 million were recorded in net realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments. Based on this value, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of other currencies under contract at December 31, 2002 would have resulted in approximately $6.3 million of unrealized losses and $1.7 million in unrealized gains, respectively. Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the other parties to the forward contracts, however the Company does not anticipate non performance. The difference between the notional principal amounts and the associated market value is the Companys maximum credit exposure. 80 Embedded Debt Derivatives The puts and the interest rate adjustment features embedded in the CARZ and LYONs are considered derivatives and are subject to fair value. There is currently minimal fair value ascribed to (i) the puts, as the contingent events of these features are considered unlikely to occur or (ii) the interest rate adjustment feature due to the current trading value of the bonds. 81
