ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Companys beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. These statements are based upon current plans, estimates and expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, for a list of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented under Item 8. Certain aspects of the Companys business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in volatility in both the Companys results of operations and financial condition.

The Company operates in markets where it believes its underwriting expertise and financial strength represent a relative advantage. The Company has grown through acquisitions and development of new business opportunities. Acquisitions included Global Capital Re in 1997, Mid Ocean Limited in 1998, ECS, Inc. and NAC Re Corp. in 1999, Winterthur International in 2001 and Le Mans Re in 2002. All acquisitions were entered into in order to further support the Companys strategic plan to develop a global platform in insurance and reinsurance. The Company competes as an integrated global business and at December 31, 2008 employed approximately 4,000 employees in 28 countries. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring initiative which will result in the Companys workforce decreasing by approximately 10% during 2009. Underwriting Environment The Company earns its revenue primarily from net premiums written and earned. The property and casualty insurance as reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, meaning that based on market conditions, there have been periods where premium rates are high and policy terms and conditions are more favorable to the Company (a hard market) and there have been periods where premium rates decline and policy terms and conditions are less favorable to the Company (a soft market). Market conditions are driven primarily by competition in the marketplace, the supply of capital in the industry, investment yields and the frequency and severity of loss events. Managements goal is to build long term shareholder value by capitalizing on current opportunities and managing through any cyclical downturns by reducing its property and casualty book of business and exposures if and when rates deteriorate to unprofitable levels. Insurance Throughout 2008, the Companys Insurance segment continued to experience soft property and casualty market conditions as premium rates across most lines of business as compared to the prior year, decreased by approximately 6% in the aggregate and competitive pressures continued. Throughout 2008, property renewals reflected decreases in premium rates of approximately 12% on average, while certain casualty lines experienced premium rate reductions averaging approximately 9%. In addition, premium rates within certain specialty lines of business decreased by up to 5%. Offsetting these premium rate decreases was strong pricing in the U.S. professional Directors and Officers (Directors and Officers) book of business, specifically with regards to financial institutions, and more recently on the offshore energy book as a result of market losses from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. In addition, during 2008, new business writings were impacted by market conditions as competitors continued to focus on retaining business in all lines and markets. However, during this period, the Company wrote approximately $900 million in new business (excluding program business and long term agreements). This was largely a result of successes in the Companys organic growth strategies which include E&S, private D&O as well as construction and upper middle market. Renewal ratios for core property, casualty and professional lines were approximately 83%. However, following the rating agency actions taken in December 2008 (see Ratings, above), the Company experienced a slight decline in renewal activity and new business opportunities in certain lines of business. For further information on recent rate and renewal activity, see 2009 Underwriting Outlook below for further information. 59 The following table provides an analysis of gross premiums written, net premiums written and net premiums earned for the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 (3) 2006 (3) GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned Casualty professional lines 1,472,874 1,351,237 1,369,668 $ 1,516,412 $ 1,376,819 $ 1,404,567 $ 1,558,746 $ 1,490,896 $ 1,483,518 Casualty other lines 1,273,016 793,512 822,252 1,342,817 848,919 819,687 1,304,245 799,957 847,834 Property catastrophe (65 ) (2,177 ) 270 15,312 (7,460 ) 52,541 149,436 68,847 56,714 Other property 886,483 505,564 471,013 871,009 599,668 535,322 830,367 490,858 500,956 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 747,311 604,786 621,774 809,073 623,085 638,162 942,974 695,391 676,009 Other specialty lines (1) 850,404 712,307 660,322 786,074 666,208 582,565 785,340 594,247 500,159 Other (2) 22,736 (22,908 ) (11,055 ) 36,698 27,439 33,416 10,167 5,776 60,784 Structured indemnity 56,155 42,505 62,801 56,871 52,177 50,328 46,018 39,400 33,349 Total 5,308,914 3,984,826 3,997,045 $ 5,434,266 $ 4,186,855 $ 4,116,588 $ 5,627,293 $ 4,185,372 $ 4,159,323 (1) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, specie, middle markets and excess and surplus lines. (2) Other includes credit and surety and other lines. (3) Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to current year presentation. Reinsurance In the Reinsurance segment, the year ended December 31, 2008 reflected a decline in premium rates across most major lines of business, as market conditions continued to soften and the reinsurance industry continued to experience pricing erosion, increased competitive pressures and increased retentions by cedants. Renewals and new business in 2008 continued to be assessed against internal hurdle rates with a continued focus on underwriting discipline. U.S. and non U.S. catastrophe exposed property lines experienced rate declines of approximately 10% while other property lines of business saw rates decrease by 10% to 15%. Ocean marine pricing rates remained flat to down 5%, while rates within the aviation market decreased by up to 10%. Casualty pricing trends in the reinsurance market experienced deterioration in rates of up to 15%, however, rate changes on business actually bound in this line of business decreased between 10 to 15%. However, with increased hurricane and other loss activity during the latter half of 2008, taken together with the distressed state of the financial markets, rate declines across all lines of business began to slow in the latter half of 2008.

As such, the Company will be highly selective on new business, emphasize short tail lines, where applicable, in the Companys reinsurance operations, exit other businesses (e.g., Casualty facultative business), non renew certain insurance programs, as well as continue to reduce long term agreements (within the insurance operations) in order to capture the benefit of improving pricing. While certain of these decisions as well as any lost business as a result of rating agency downgrades will result in a reduction to both gross and net premiums written in 2009, the Company expects such negative impacts to be partially offset by the positive impact of hardening rates across most lines of business as described below. Throughout 2007 and the majority of 2008, the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets experienced soft market conditions across most, if not all lines of business, as evidenced by decreases in market pricing and a weakening of policy terms and conditions. However, following catastrophe activity throughout 2008, most notably, losses resulting from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, and more importantly, following severe economic conditions and the impacts of the financial crisis, which reduced the available capital of many property and casualty (re)insurers, market capacity decreased and in conjunction, market pricing across most insurance and reinsurance lines of business began to improve and is expected to continue improving throughout 2009. The following is a summary of the January 2009 rate indications and recent renewal activity for each of the Insurance and Reinsurance segments of the Company: Insurance With regards to market conditions within the core lines of business within the Insurance segment, fourth quarter 2008 renewals reflected modest improvement in market conditions as premium rates improved across all line of business and certain lines experienced rate increases. Overall, December 2008 renewals reflected an aggregate price increase of 1% for the entire book. More specifically, December premium rates increased approximately 5% in professional lines, 10% in offshore energy and well over 10% in the Companys specie book. Rates in both property and casualty were down in the low single digits. Initial indications based on January 2009 renewals reflect continued rate improvement with positive rate movement in property, professional and some specialty lines. Rates within the Companys casualty lines were down slightly by approximately 3%, which represents a significant improvement as compared to rate declines experienced in 2008. While the Insurance segments gross and net premiums written will be impacted by its decision to focus on those lines of business that provide the best return on capital as described above, as well as from a certain level of lost renewals or business opportunities as a result of rating agency actions taken throughout 2008, indications from recent underwriting activity highlight that retention rates remain strong and broadly in line with managements expectations. Reinsurance Across the Reinsurance segment, initial indications, based on January 1, 2009 renewals, point to a moderate rise in premium rates across most major lines of business. Market conditions continue to harden as a result of the reduction in available reinsurer capital, due in part to the credit and liquidity crisis, causing a firming in market pricing across most lines of business. U.S. and non U.S. catastrophe exposed property lines experienced rate increases of approximately 15% and 5% respectively, while other property lines in the U.S. were generally flat. While U.S. casualty rates, excluding D&O, were down slightly, casualty motor rates in Europe saw increases of up to 10% with rates in other casualty lines remaining flat. In addition, aviation and marine lines of business experienced rate increases of between 5 to 10%. 61 Initial indications of renewal activity have been positive, despite the expected impact of lost renewals and new business opportunities as a result of the rating agency actions taken in December 2008, most notably, the downgrade by S&P, especially in Europe. While some insurers chose not to renew their business with the Company, overall, the negative impact on gross and net premiums written based on such renewal activity has been partially offset by the increase in rates as noted above. Investment Environment The Company seeks to generate revenue from investment activities through returns on its investment portfolio. The Companys current investment strategy seeks to support the liabilities arising from the operations of the Company, generate investment income and build book value over the longer term. During the year ended December 31, 2008, financial market conditions continued to be extremely challenging as the global credit crisis that began in July 2007, continued to adversely impact global markets. This unprecedented market volatility directly and materially affected the Companys results of operations and investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting in decreased net investment income and increases in both realized and unrealized losses in the Companys investment portfolio. The fixed income markets experienced a period of extreme volatility during 2008, negatively impacting market liquidity conditions. As a result, the market for fixed income instruments experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased probability of default. Domestic and international equity markets also experienced heightened volatility and turmoil during this period. During 2008, the Company reported significant decreases in both its structured credit and corporate portfolios as a result of the negative conditions described above. Within the structured credit portfolio, the market conditions particularly impacted the Companys holdings in sub prime non agency securities, second liens, ABS CDOs with sub prime collateral and Alt A mortgages (Topical Assets), core collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS). Within the corporate portfolio, the Companys financial sector holdings were particularly affected as credit spreads, which widened across the entire rating spectrum impacted all spread assets classes, particularly financials following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) in September 2008 and the subsequent failure or near failure of other financial institutions. The impact of the credit spread widening was partially offset by the increase in the fixed income portfolio which resulted from declining government interest rates. Claims Environment The Companys profitability in any given period is based upon its premium and investment revenues as noted above, less net losses incurred and expenses. Net losses incurred are based upon claims paid and changes to unpaid loss reserves. Unpaid loss reserves are estimated by the Company and include both reported loss reserves and reserves for losses incurred but not reported, or IBNR. The Companys lower underwriting results for 2008 as compared to 2007 were largely a reflection of the increase in catastrophe and property risk losses experienced in 2008. However, offsetting the current year incurred losses was $610.7 million of net favorable prior year reserve development in various lines of business within the Companys Insurance and Reinsurance segments. In contrast, the Companys positive underwriting results for 2007 and 2006 were partly a result of the lack of significant catastrophe events occurring throughout these years as well as net favorable development of prior year reserves. However, consistent with 2006 and 2007, net favorable development was partially offset in 2008 by the continuing increase in current period loss ratios during this period. The increase in 2008 reflects the impact of the softening rate environment as well as higher levels of catastrophe and attritional losses as noted above. In addition, in 2008, claims activity within the D&O and Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance markets overall, rose as a result of an increase in class action lawsuits filed against public companies due to market losses and related stock price depreciation associated with the sub prime mortgage and credit crisis in the U.S. Management actively monitors its potential exposure to such events and gives due consideration to emerging claim trends in determining its loss reserve requirements at each quarter end. For further analysis of this exposure, see Results of Operations below. 62 Financial Measures The following are some of the financial measures management considers important in evaluating the Companys operating performance in the Companys property and casualty operations: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except ratios and per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 Underwriting profit property and casualty operations $ 307,205 $ 737,449 $ 733,633 Combined ratio property and casualty operations 95.7 % 88.8 % 89.5 % Net investment income property and casualty operations (1) $ 1,174,856 $ 1,289,554 $ 1,090,785 Book value per ordinary share $ 15.46 $ 50.30 $ 53.12 Fully diluted book value per ordinary share (2) $ 15.46 $ 50.29 $ 53.01 Return on average ordinary shareholders equity NM * 2.2 % 19.6 % (1) Net investment income relating to property and casualty operations does not include the net investment income related to the net results from structured products. (2) Fully diluted book value per ordinary share represents book value per ordinary share combined with the impact from dilution of share based compensation including in the money stock options at any period end. The Company believes that fully diluted book value per ordinary share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry. However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry. * NM Not Meaningful Underwriting profit (loss) property and casualty operations One way that the Company evaluates the performance of its insurance and reinsurance operations is the underwriting profit or loss. The Company does not measure performance based on the amount of gross premiums written. Underwriting profit or loss is calculated from premiums earned and fee income, less net losses incurred and expenses related to underwriting activities, plus unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on underwriting balances. The Companys underwriting profit in the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily reflective of the combined ratio discussed below. The Companys strong property and casualty underwriting profit for 2007 and 2006 were partly a result of the lack of significant catastrophe events occuring throughout these years and net favorable prior year loss development. Any changes to loss reserves affect the calculation of underwriting profit or loss but most often do not directly affect the Companys cash flow in the same period. Combined ratio property and casualty operations The combined ratio for property and casualty operations is used by the Company and many other insurance and reinsurance companies as another measure of underwriting profitability. The combined ratio is calculated from the net losses incurred and underwriting expenses as a ratio of the net premiums earned for the Companys general insurance and reinsurance operations. A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit and over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. The Companys combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008, was higher than the previous year, primarily as a result of an increase in the loss and loss expense ratio as well as the underwriting expense ratio. The higher loss and loss expense ratio resulted from higher current year attritional and catastrophe losses, primarily in property lines, combined with lower net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007, as a result of the continuing competitive underwriting environment and softening market conditions noted above. The higher 2008 loss ratio also results from a higher level of loss activity in professional lines due to the subprime and related credit crises. Partially offsetting the increase in incurred losses was higher favorable prior year reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2008. While acquisition expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, the increase in operating expenses combined with the impact from the lower level of net premiums earned caused an increase in the underwriting expense ratio. The Companys combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2007 was lower than the previous year, primarily as a result of a lower loss and loss expenses ratio partially offset by a higher underwriting expense ratio. The lower loss and loss expense ratio has resulted mainly from higher net favorable prior year development in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006, while the 63 increased underwriting expense ratio was driven largely by increased compensation costs and continued pricing pressures that have resulted in less premium earned. Net investment income property and casualty operations Net investment income related to property and casualty operations is an important measure that affects the Companys overall profitability. The largest liability of the Company relates to its unpaid loss reserves, and the Companys investment portfolio provides liquidity for claims settlements of these reserves as they become due, and thus a significant part of the portfolio is in fixed income securities. Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates and credit spreads and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income related to property and casualty operations, excluding structured products, decreased by $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007. Overall, portfolio yields decreased in 2008 as yields earned on investment of cash flows and reinvestment of maturing or sold securities were generally lower than on securities previously held, as prevailing market interest rates, particularly in the U.S., decreased overall during the last twelve months. The portfolio mix has also changed as a result of the settlement of the GIC and funding agreement liabilities, as the property and casualty operations assumed a number of the floating rate securities previously held in the Companys Other Financial Lines segment and accordingly, net investment income is more sensitive to changes in short term interest rates. The Company has also increased allocations to lower yielding cash, government and agency investments. The increase in net investment income in 2007 was primarily due to several years of positive operating cash flows which resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base. In addition, during 2007, portfolio yields increased in the Companys investment portfolio, due primarily to the full 2007 financial year impact of the higher interest rates experienced in the U.S., U.K. and Euro zone, during the latter part of 2006 and the beginning part of 2007. Book value per ordinary share Management also views the change in the Companys book value per ordinary share as an additional measure of the Companys performance. Book value per share is calculated by dividing ordinary shareholders equity by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end. Book value per ordinary share is affected primarily by the Companys net income (loss), by any changes in the net unrealized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, currency translation adjustments and also the impact of any share repurchase or issuance activity. Book value per ordinary share decreased by $34.84 in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to a decrease of $2.82 during 2007 as noted below. The decrease in 2008 was primarily as a result of the Companys issuance of Class A ordinary shares issued at a discount to book value (as described below), the Companys net loss of $2.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008 and the increase in net unrealized losses on investments of approximately $2.9 billion, net of tax, during the same period. In addition, book value per ordinary share decreased as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $472.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. In August 2008, the Company issued 143.8 million Class A ordinary shares at a price of $16.00 per share, which was lower than the Companys book value per ordinary share at the time and thus dilutive. The Companys net loss of $2.6 billion was mainly due to the impact of the closing of the Master Agreement in August 2008 as described above, the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 of $990.0 million, catastrophe and attritional losses, as well as from net realized losses on investments and losses from investment fund affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net unrealized losses on investments of $2.9 billion, net of tax, during the year ended December 31, of 2008 was mainly as a result of widening credit spreads on corporate and structured credit assets, offset by declines in interest rates, while unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments during the same period resulted from the increase in value of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies, predominately the Euro and U.K. Sterling. Book value per ordinary share decreased by $2.82 during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $50.30 from $53.12. The decrease in book value per share in 2007 was primarily as a result of an increase in net 64 unrealized losses on investments of $743.0 million, net of tax, partially offset by net income of $206.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which increased book value, together with an increase in currency translation adjustments due to the impact of the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar on the net assets of European based subsidiaries. In addition, certain capital and financing activities impacted book value per ordinary share, including the Companys share repurchase activity throughout 2007 which decreased book value per ordinary share, as the price paid for such shares was at a premium to book value; however, this was partially offset by the issuance of Class A ordinary shares upon maturity of the purchase contracts associated with the 6.5% Equity Security Units (the 6.5% Units), as the ordinary shares were issued at a premium to book value. As noted above, fully diluted book value per ordinary share represents book value per ordinary share combined with the impact from dilution of share based compensation including in the money stock options at any period end. Fully diluted book value per ordinary share decreased by $34.83 during the year ended December 31, 2008 as a result of the factors noted above and is consistent with the decrease in basic book value per ordinary share as there were no in the money stock options at December 31, 2008 as a result of the reduction in market price of the Companys ordinary shares in 2008. Return on average ordinary shareholders equity Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE) is another financial measure that management considers important in evaluating the Companys operating performance. ROE is calculated by dividing the net income for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes minimum target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys minimum ROE targets over the longer term are not met with respect to any line of business, the Company seeks to modify and or exit these lines. In addition, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is significantly dependent on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value as measured by ROE (adjusted for certain items considered to be non operating in nature). In 2008, ROE was negative, mainly as a result of the impact of the closing of the Master Agreement in August 2008 as described above, the goodwill impairment charge recorded in late 2008, as well as from catastrophe losses, net realized losses on investments and losses from the Companys investment fund affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2008. In 2007, ROE was 2.2%, 17.4 percentage points lower than the prior year, primarily as a result of losses recorded in the second half of 2007 in relation to adverse credit market conditions, including but not limited to, losses associated with the Companys investment in and reinsurance agreements with Syncora and realized losses, including other than temporary impairment charges (OTTI), in the Companys investment portfolio. For further details of these losses, see Results of Operations below. Partially offsetting these decreases were strong underwriting results in 2007 within the Companys core property and casualty operations and lower levels of shareholders equity resulting from capital activity and increases in unrealized losses on investments. Results of Operations The following table presents an analysis of the Companys net income (loss) available to ordinary shareholders and other financial measures (described below) for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 Net (loss) income available to ordinary shareholders $ (2,632,458 ) $ 206,375 $ 1,722,445 (Loss) earnings per ordinary share basic $ (11.02 ) $ 1.16 $ 9.63 (Loss) earnings per ordinary share diluted $ (11.02 ) $ 1.15 $ 9.60 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents basic 238,862 178,500 178,793 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents diluted 238,862 179,693 179,450 65 The Companys net income (loss) and other financial measures as shown above for the three years ended December 31 have been affected by among other things, the following significant items: 1 ) impact of the closing of the Master Agreement (defined below) in August 2008 and the impact in 2007 of the Companys investment in and relationships with Syncora; 2 ) impact of credit market movements in 2008 and 2007 on the Companys investment portfolio and investment fund affiliates; 3 ) continuing competitive underwriting environment; 4 ) net prior year favorable loss development; 5 ) impact of increased property risk and catastrophe activity 2008 and limited property risk catastrophe activity in 2007 and 2006; and 6 ) goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008. 1. Impact of the closing of the Master Agreement in August 2008 and the impact in 2007 of the Companys investment in and relationships with Syncora On July 28, 2008, the Company announced that it and certain of its subsidiaries had entered into an agreement (the Master Agreement) with Syncora and certain of its subsidiaries (sometimes collectively referred to herein as Syncora) as well as certain counterparties to credit default swap agreements (the Counterparties), in connection with the termination of certain reinsurance and other agreements. The transactions and termination of certain reinsurance and other agreements under the Master Agreement closed on August 5, 2008. For a description of the Master Agreement, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Syncora Holdings Ltd. (Syncora). After the closing of the Master Agreement on August 5, 2008, approximately $64.6 billion of the Companys total net exposure (which was $65.7 billion as at June 30, 2008) under reinsurance agreements and guarantees with Syncora subsidiaries was eliminated. Pursuant to the terms of the Master Agreement, Syncora is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commute the agreements that are the subject of the Companys guarantee of Syncora Guarantees obligations under certain financial guarantees issued by Syncora Guarantee to the European Investment Bank (the EIB Policies), subject to certain limitations. As at December 31, 2008, the Companys exposures relating to the EIB Policies (which relate to project finance transactions) was approximately $955.4 million reduced from $1.1 billion at June 30, 2008 mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of the underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2008, there had been no reported events of default on the underlying obligations, accordingly, no reserves have been recorded. The terms of the Master Agreement were determined in consideration of a number of commercial and economic factors associated with all existing relationships with Syncora, including, but not limited to, a valuation of the consideration for the commuted agreements and any potential future claims thereunder and the impact of outstanding uncertainty on both the ratings and business operations of the Company. The total value of the consideration noted above of $1.775 billion as well as the eight million ordinary shares of the Company transferred to Syncora valued at $128.0 million, significantly exceeded the carried net liabilities of approximately $490.7 million related to such reinsurances and guarantees. Management considers the execution of the Master Agreement as the event giving rise to the additional liability. As detailed in the table below, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $1.4 billion in respect of the closing of the Master Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in millions) Carried liabilities in relation to reinsurance and guarantee agreements commuted under the Master Agreement $ 490.7 Other accruals (5.2 ) Cash payment made to Syncora in August 2008 (1,775.0 ) Value of XL common shares transferred under the Master Agreement (128.0 ) Net loss associated with Master Agreement recorded in the year endedDecember 31, 2008 $ (1,417.5 ) 66 Given managements view of the risk exposure along with the uncertainty facing the entire financial guarantee industry in the latter part of 2007, the Company reduced the reported value of its investment in Syncora to nil at December 31, 2007, from the reported equity method value of $669.8 million as at September 30, 2007. In addition, net losses were recorded in 2007 within loss from operating affiliates with respect to the previous excess of loss and facultative reinsurance of Syncora subsidiaries in the amounts of $300.0 million and $51.0 million, respectively. In addition, during 2007, the Company incurred $17.9 million in additional mark to market losses related to those underlying contracts in credit default swap form subject to the provisions noted above. 2. Impact of credit market movements in 2008 and 2007 on the Companys investment portfolio and investment fund affiliates During the year ended December 31, 2008, financial market conditions continued to be extremely challenging as the global credit crisis that began in July 2007, continued to adversely impact global markets. This unprecedented market volatility directly and materially affected the Companys results of operations and investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008. The credit markets experienced a period of extreme deterioration during 2008, negatively impacting market liquidity conditions. As a result, the market for fixed income instruments experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased probability of default. Domestic and international equity markets also experienced heightened volatility and turmoil during this period. During 2008, the Company reported significant decreases in both its structured credit and corporate portfolios as a result of the negative conditions described above. Within the structured credit portfolio, the market conditions particularly impacted the Companys holdings in Topical Assets, CDOs and CMBS. Within the corporate portfolio, the Companys financial sector holdings were particularly affected as credit spreads, which widened across the entire rating spectrum impacted all spread assets classes, particularly financial institutions following the bankruptcy of Lehman in September 2008 and the subsequent failure or near failure of other financial institutions including Tier One and Upper Tier Two securities (representing committed term debt and hybrid instruments senior to the common and preferred equities of the financial institutions). The impact of the credit spread widening was partially offset by the increase in the fixed income portfolio which resulted from declining government interest rates. The following table provides further detail regarding the extreme volatility in the global credit markets, as well as in government interest rates using some sample market indices: Interest Rate Movement for the yearended December 31, 2008 (1)( represents decreases in interest rates) Credit Spread Movement for the yearended December 31, 2008 (2)(+ represents widening of credit spreads) United States 189 basis points (5 year treasury) + 439 basis points (US Corporate A rated) + 72 basis points (US Agency RMBS, AAA rated) + 753 basis points (US CMBS, AAA rated) United Kingdom 149 basis points (10 year Gilt) + 217 basis points (UK Corporate, AA rated) Euro zone 180 basis points (5 year Bund) + 317 basis points (Europe Corporate, A rated) (1) Source: Bloomberg Finance L.P. (2) Source: Merrill Lynch Global Indices. The net impact of the market conditions over the course of 2008 on the Companys investment portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted in net realized losses of $962.1 million and an increase in net unrealized losses on available for sale investments of $2.9 billion. This represents approximately a 12.2% deterioration on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2008. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, Deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to additional investment losses and We are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, above. Since the time of the Companys August 2008 public offering of ordinary shares and equity security units (See Results of Operations Other Key Focuses of Management Capital Management, below), the volatility and disruption in the global capital markets reached unprecedented levels and substantially increased during both the third and fourth quarters of 2008. 67 During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a charge on its investment portfolio for OTTI of $400.0 million in relation to impaired assets that it could no longer assert its intent to hold until recovery. Management believes that these securities were at risk for further mark to market declines, and potentially real economic losses, to the extent that economic conditions were to deteriorate further than present estimates and the Companys allocation to these asset classes is overweight relative to traditional P&C portfolio. By taking the charge as noted above, the Company expects to be able to accelerate its investment portfolio risk reduction exercise during 2009. As a result of the charge noted above, management is likely to pursue targeted sales of these assets over the course of 2009, and expects to realize the associated losses on these securities. The assets are concentrated in certain holdings within the Companys BBB and lower corporate, CMBS, equity and consumer ABS portfolios. Corporate credit portfolio The following table details the Companys corporate credit exposures by certain asset classes as well as ratings levels within the Companys fixed maturity portfolio and the current net unrealized (loss) position as at December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in millions) AAA AA A BBB BB & Below Total Financials Fair value $ 712.4 $ 1,280.6 $ 2,153.3 $ 343.4 $ 64.7 $ 4,554.4 Net unrealized (loss) $ (14.6 ) $ (145.4 ) $ (659.5 ) $ (158.2 ) $ (44.0 ) $ (1,021.7 ) Non Financials Fair value $ 521.8 $ 711.4 $ 2,213.2 $ 1,511.6 $ 552.9 $ 5,510.9 Net unrealized (loss) $ (14.7 ) $ (22.6 ) $ (307.2 ) $ (306.9 ) $ (216.6 ) $ (868.0 ) Total Fair value $ 1,234.2 $ 1,992.0 $ 4,366.5 $ 1,855.0 $ 617.6 $ 10,065.3 Net unrealized (loss) $ (29.3 ) $ (168.0 ) $ (966.7 ) $ (465.1 ) $ (260.6 ) $ (1,889.7 ) At December 31, 2008, approximately $1.7 billion of the Companys $4.6 billion in corporate financial sector securities was held in the portfolios supporting the Companys Life Reinsurance Operations. Management continues the strategic analysis of the Companys life reinsurance business. The assets associated with that business are more heavily weighted towards longer term securities from financial institutions, including a significant portion of the Companys Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 securities, representing committed term debt and hybrid instruments senior to the common and preferred equity of the financial institutions. Financials held in Life portfolios accounted for $663.1 million of the Companys net unrealized loss as at December 31, 2008. As at December 31, 2008 approximately 34.0% of the overall sensitivity to interest rate risk and 37.8% to credit risk was related to the life reinsurance portfolio, despite these portfolios accounting for only 17.6% of the fixed income portfolio. 68 Structured credit portfolio The following table details the Companys structured credit exposures by certain asset classes as well as ratings levels within the Companys fixed maturity portfolio and the current net unrealized gain (loss) position as at December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in millions) AAA AA A BBB BB & Below Total CMBS Fair value $ 2,101.5 $ 15.2 $ 15.4 $ 11.8 $ 10.6 $ 2,154.5 Net unrealized (loss) $ (331.8 ) $ (5.1 ) $ (4.9 ) $ (7.7 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (361.9 ) Prime RMBS Fair value $ 2,862.4 $ 132.1 $ 57.1 $ 14.6 $ 36.3 $ 3,102.5 Net unrealized (loss) $ (155.7 ) $ (67.0 ) $ (45.5 ) $ (5.0 ) $ (13.0 ) $ (286.2 ) Topical Assets Fair value $ 558.3 $ 183.7 $ 98.9 $ 48.0 $ 74.6 $ 963.5 Net unrealized (loss) $ (312.5 ) $ (157.5 ) $ (63.4 ) $ (24.7 ) $ (36.5 ) $ (594.6 ) Core CDOs (1) Fair value $ 166.1 $ 324.4 $ 51.7 $ 110.3 $ 13.7 $ 666.2 Net unrealized (loss) $ (61.7 ) $ (173.9 ) $ (46.6 ) $ (163.7 ) $ (24.1 ) $ (470.0 ) Other Asset & Mortgage Backed Securities Fair value $ 1,253.3 $ 108.1 $ 267.6 $ 61.7 $ 28.2 $ 1,718.9 Net unrealized (loss) $ (57.3 ) $ (18.3 ) $ (74.1 ) $ (28.9 ) $ (2.3 ) $ (180.9 ) Total Fair value $ 6,941.6 $ 763.5 $ 490.7 $ 246.4 $ 163.4 $ 8,605.4 Net unrealized (loss) $ (919.0 ) $ (421.8 ) $ (234.5 ) $ (230.0 ) $ (88.3 ) $ (1,893.6 ) (1) The Company defines Core CDOs as investments in non mortgage collateralized debt obligations, primarily consisting of collateralized loan obligations. The following table details the current exposures to Topical Assets within the Companys fixed income portfolio as well as the current net unrealized (loss) gain position as at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007: (U.S. dollars in thousands) As at December 31, 2008 As at December 31, 2007 Holding atFair Value Percentof FixedIncomePortfolio NetUnrealized(Loss) Gain Holdingat FairValue Percentof FixedIncomePortfolio NetUnrealized(Loss) Gain Topical Assets: Sub prime first lien mortgages $ 487,659 1.5 % $ (311,435 ) $ 995,947 2.5 % $ (145,785 ) Alt A mortgages 406,098 1.3 % (270,486 ) 924,783 2.3 % (40,145 ) Second lien mortgages (including sub prime second lien mortgages) 58,903 0.2 % (5,313 ) 97,647 0.3 % 788 ABS CDOs with sub prime collateral 10,595 0.0 % (7,308 ) 39,317 0.1 % 101 Total exposure to Topical Assets $ 963,255 3.0 % $ (594,542 ) $ 2,057,694 5.2 % $ (185,041 ) Of the total Topical Assets with fair value exposure as at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 of $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, approximately $40.5 million and $76.8 million, respectively, of the related securities had ratings dependent on guarantees issued by third party guarantors (i.e., monoline insurers). Decreases in the ratings of such third party guarantors would typically decrease the fair value of guaranteed securities; however, at December 31, 2008, in the event of non performance at such date on the part of these third party guarantors, the Company estimated that the average credit quality of this portfolio would be A and that approximately 96.1% would have remained investment grade at such date. In addition, of the total fixed income portfolio as at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, of $31.9 billion and $39.6 billion, respectively, less than 2% were guaranteed by such third parties with no individual third party representing more than 1%. 69 At December 31, 2008, the Companys sub prime and Alt A exposures remained primarily highly rated, had adequate underlying loan characteristics and the Company believed at such date that they were supported by adequate subordination levels based on current expectations of house price declines, loss severities and default levels. The Company had approximately $523.1 million of Topical Assets downgraded during the year ended December 31, 2008. However, 92.2% of the Companys holdings remain rated investment grade at December 31, 2008. Liquidations necessary to fund the repayment of the GIC liabilities following the downgrade of Syncora Guarantee and the maturity of certain funding agreements were funded through sales of assets in the Other Financial Lines segment investment portfolios as well as the general investment portfolio. Managements approach was to avoid the sale of assets where current market prices did not reflect intrinsic values or where transaction costs for liquidation were excessive. As a result, the Company continues to hold approximately $1.4 billion of Topical Assets and core CDOs and these have been transferred to the general portfolio in exchange for those assets that were liquidated. Realized losses and other than temporary impairments Net realized losses on investments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 included net realized losses of approximately $1,023.6 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys fixed income, equity and other investments, including Lehman, where the Company determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments, including a charge of $400.0 million related to assets for which the Company could no longer assert its intent to hold to recovery. See below for further information. Included in net realized losses noted above are net realized gains of $98.8 million as related to the foreign exchange component of inter company sales of assets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, net realized losses of $400.0 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys fixed income and equity investments, where, although managements analysis of the securities indicated that these assets were expected to pay out all expected cash flows, management can no longer assert that it intends to hold these securities until such time as they recover, as management intends to pursue sales of these securities in connection with its efforts to reduce the risk within the Companys the investment portfolio. Included in the impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $121.4 million of related exposures to financial institutions, primarily related to Lehman. The remaining impairment during 2008 was spread across the portfolio including structured credit, equity and other fixed income investments, with $228.5 million related to securities with sub prime and Alt A collateral which are included in the table below. Consistent with prior quarters, management continues to evaluate the impairment of the portfolio and satisfy itself that the remaining gross unrealized losses are temporary in nature. The following table provides the realized and unrealized impact related to the Topical Assets during the year ended December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Realized(Loss) and(Impairments) Changein NetUnrealized(Loss) Topical Assets: Sub prime first lien mortgages $ (124,518 ) $ (165,650 ) Alt A mortgages (118,318 ) (230,341 ) Second lien mortgages (including sub prime second lien mortgages) (15,664 ) (6,101 ) ABS CDOs with sub prime collateral (17,209 ) (7,409 ) Total $ (275,709 ) $ (409,501 ) All portfolio holdings, including those with sub prime exposure, are reviewed as part of the ongoing other than temporary impairment monitoring process. The Company continues to actively monitor its exposures, and to the extent market disruptions continue, including but not limited to disruptions in the residential mortgage market and the related impacts on the assumptions embedded in the Companys impairment assessments and estimates of future cash flows, the Companys financial position could be 70 negatively impacted. See Item 1A, Risk Factors Deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to additional investment losses, above. Alternative investment portfolio Net income from investment fund affiliates was negative in the year ended December 31, 2008. Broad based market declines, combined with extreme volatility, a sharp pull back in the availability of credit and short sale restrictions implemented by securities market regulators, proved highly challenging for the strategies employed by many of the Companys alternative investment managers. The Companys alternative investments are managed to maximize total return on a risk adjusted basis, and the results during 2008 as compared to 2007 were reflective of different market conditions and opportunities available over these periods. 3. Continuing competitive underwriting environment Soft market conditions were experienced across most lines of business throughout 2007 and most of 2008, resulting in an overall decrease in gross and net premiums written. For further information in relation to the underwriting environment, including details relating to rates and retention, see Executive Overview Underwriting Environment, above. In addition, in the latter part of 2008, unprecedented economic conditions continued to impact the Company. These conditions, combined with the recent volatility in the Companys share price, rating agency actions with respect to the Company and issues faced by some of the Companys competitors, resulted in the creation of challenges as well as certain opportunities for the Companys P&C operations. 4. Net prior year favorable loss development Net prior year favorable loss development occurs when there is a decrease to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prior years that is less than expected loss development. Net prior year adverse loss development occurs when there is an increase to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prior years exceeding expected loss development. The following table presents the net (favorable) adverse prior year loss development of the Companys loss and loss expense reserves for its property and casualty operations which include the Insurance and Reinsurance segments for each of the years indicated: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Insurance segment $ (305.5 ) $ (158.1 ) $ (13.2 ) Reinsurance segment (305.2 ) (267.3 ) (97.4 ) Total $ (610.7 ) $ (425.4 ) $ (110.6 ) During 2008, net favorable prior year development totaled $610.7 million in the Companys property and casualty operations and included net favorable development in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments of $305.5 million and $305.2 million, respectively. Within the Reinsurance segment, net favorable prior year reserve development included casualty and other lines reserve releases in both European and U.S. casualty and professional portfolios as well as reserve releases associated with the RITC relating to the 2005 year of account on certain Lloyds sourced business. In the same period, property and other short tail lines net favorable development was attributable to most business units globally. The Insurance segment net favorable prior year reserve development was due to reserve releases in global property lines of business as a result of favorable claim development as well as reserve releases in certain casualty lines primarily in accident years 2003 to 2006 years due to lower than expected reported loss activity. In addition, net reserve releases of approximately $80.9 million resulted from an agreement with Axa/Winterthur in the fourth quarter of 2008 in regards to certain reinsurance recoverable balances relating to casualty lines and to a lesser extent, certain property lines of business. Offsetting this favorable development was modest reserve strengthening within environmental lines as well as strengthening associated with certain structured indemnity contracts. Within the professional lines, reserve releases in the 2003 to 2006 accident years were largely offset by strengthening of reserves in the 2007 year. 71 During 2007, the Company had net favorable prior year reserve development in property and casualty operations of $425.4 million compared to $110.6 million for the same period in 2006. Reinsurance net favorable development accounted for $267.3 million of the release in 2007, while net favorable development within the Insurance segment totaled $158.1 million for the same period. The corresponding prior year development on a gross basis was $259.7 million for the Reinsurance segment and $177.6 million for the Insurance segment. Within the Reinsurance segment, reserve releases of $188.7 million in property and other short tail lines of business and $87.4 million in casualty and other lines, were partially offset by adverse prior year development of $8.8 million within the structured indemnity line of business. The Insurance segments net prior year reserve releases consisted of $95.0 million in property and $162.1 million in casualty lines of business, partially offset by net adverse development of $23.0 million, $7.0 million and $69.0 million in certain professional, marine and other lines of business, respectively. During 2006, the Company had net favorable prior year reserve development in property and casualty operations of $110.6 million. Within the Insurance segment, net overall favorable prior year reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $13.2 million, while net favorable development within the Reinsurance segment during the same period was $97.4 million. See Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and see further discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 5. Impact of increased property risk and catastrophe activity in 2008 and limited property risk and catastrophe activity in 2007 and 2006 As compared to 2006 and 2007, 2008 saw increases in property risk losses as well as catastrophe activity and resulting incurred losses, primarily related to U.S. windstorm activity. On September 1, 2008, Hurricane Gustav hit the Louisiana coast of the U.S. as a Category 2 hurricane, causing considerable damage to insured property and loss of life. On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike made landfall near Galveston, Texas as a strong Category 2 hurricane, causing significantly more damage and loss of life than Hurricane Gustav. Based on market estimates, Hurricane Ike is estimated to have caused the third largest ever insured loss in the U.S. from a wind storm. The Company has estimated losses incurred, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums, of $22.5 million and $210.0 million related to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, respectively. Actual losses may vary from this estimate based on a number of factors, including receipt of additional information from insureds and brokers, the attribution of losses to coverages that had not previously been considered as exposed and inflation in repair costs due to additional demand for labor and materials. In addition to natural peril catastrophes, there was also an increase in large property risk losses globally during 2008 that contributed to higher loss ratios in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Overall, 2007 and 2006 experienced a lower number of natural catastrophes as compared to 2008, although 2007 did result in an increase in overall natural catastrophe activity and insured losses as compared to 2006. In 2007, six hurricanes formed in the Atlantic region including two Category 5 hurricanes, while other natural catastrophes in 2007 included European windstorms Kyrill and Per/Hanno, California wildfires, floods in the U.K. and Mexico, the Peruvian earthquake and five hurricanes in the Eastern Pacific region. In 2006, there were only five hurricanes in the Atlantic region and more importantly there was no significant insured damage for those hurricanes that did make landfall. 6. Goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 Due to the financial market and economic events that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test for goodwill subsequent to its annual testing date of June 30. The interim impairment test resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $990.0 million. The charge relates primarily to certain reinsurance units goodwill associated with the merger of Mid Ocean Limited (Mid Ocean) in 1998. The fair value of the Mid Ocean reporting unit was calculated using the methodologies as described within Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below, and by comparison with similar companies using their publicly traded price multiples as the basis for valuation. For further information, see Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and see further discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 72 Other Key Focuses of Management Throughout the latter part of 2008 and into early 2009, the Company remains focused on, among other things, simplifying the Companys business model to focus on core property and casualty business and enhancing its enterprise risk management capabilities. Details relating to these initiatives are highlighted below. Simplify the Companys Business Model and Enhance Risk Management In relation to this top management priority, certain initiatives that have taken place or are underway include the following: Focus on P&C Businesses: In order to support the Companys focus on its dual platform of Insurance and Reinsurance P&C businesses, the Company ceased certain operations that included the closure of the XLFS business unit and reassignment of responsibility for structured indemnity business to either the Insurance segment or Reinsurance segment depending on the underlying nature of the transactions. As noted above, going forward, the Company plans to focus on those lines of business within its insurance and reinsurance operations that provide the best return on capital. As such, the Company will be highly selective on new business, emphasize short tail lines, where applicable, in the Companys reinsurance operations, exit other businesses (e.g., Casualty facultative business), non renew certain insurance programs, as well as continue to reduce long term agreements (within the insurance operations) in order to capture the benefit of hardening markets. In addition, the Company announced its intention to review strategic opportunities relating to its Life reinsurance business which resulted in the Company selling the renewal rights to its life, accident and health business, a relatively small block of business, in late 2008. The Company continues to explore various strategic options for its annuity book, the mortality and critical illness book and as well for its U.S. life reinsurance business. Enterprise Risk Management: The Company is focused on enhancing its risk management capabilities throughout all facets of its operations. This initiative is led by the Companys newly hired Chief Enterprise Risk Officer (CERO) as noted below. The CERO is supported by, among others, the Companys Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the ERM Committee) comprised of the most senior risk takers and managers of the Company. The ERM Committee will continue to assist with the efficient identification, assessment, monitoring, and reporting of key risks across the Company. On September 15, 2008, Mr. Jacob D. Rosengarten joined the Company as Executive Vice President and CERO. Mr. Rosengarten reports directly to the Companys Chief Executive Officer, Michael S. McGavick, and chairs the Companys ERM Committee. In addition, the Board of Directors has created a special committee of the Board to oversee endeavours in this area. Simplify Investment Portfolio Over Time: In order to reposition the Companys investment portfolio to one that supports a P&C focused operation, the Company began repositioning the portfolio in 2008 so that a) book value volatility particularly related to credit spreads arising from the portfolio is reduced, b) a reduction in lower rated corporate securities and financial issuers is achieved, c) exposure to CMBS securities is reduced and d) a reduction in asset classes such as subprime, Alt A and Core CDOs previously supporting Other Financial Lines activities is achieved. Realignment will be achieved primarily through cash generated from bond maturities and coupon reinvestment, cash flow from business operations as well as certain opportunistic sales. Consistent with this strategy, management continued the process of reducing risk in the investment portfolio during the latter part of 2008. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred positions were sold as well as securities of a number of regional banks and other financial institutions. Most of this was accomplished prior to the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008 when credit markets became even more disrupted. In addition, management reduced the aggregate sub prime, Alt A, CMBS and CDO portfolio holdings significantly, through natural cash flows and certain opportunistic sales. Results of portfolio simplification efforts included a reduction in exposure of $1.6 billion in the CMBS portfolio, as well as reducing the aggregate corporate portfolios by $1.2 billion during 2008. The Company also reduced its risk exposure to alternative investments by approximately $0.8 billion during 2008 in response to adverse market conditions and ongoing efforts to reduce the risk within 73 its investment portfolio. As well, following the charge of $400.0 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008 relating to impaired assets that the Company could no longer assert its intent to hold to recovery, the Company expects to be able to accelerate its investment portfolio risk reduction exercise during 2009. Management further reduced interest rate risk exposure during 2008 by shortening the duration of the portfolio supporting the U.S. property and casualty operations by 0.6 years. Cash and government agency holdings were increased by approximately $2.4 billion to approximately $13.2 billion representing approximately 41.2% of the fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2008. Reduction of Expenses to Reflect Simplified Business: In light of the changes in business strategy noted above and in response to expense pressure from softening market conditions and other significant market events which impacted the Company throughout 2008, the Company implemented in the third quarter of 2008 and subsequently in the first quarter of 2009, expense reduction initiatives designed to streamline certain of its processes and functions and reduce the Companys expense across all major geographic locations, with primary emphasis on corporate functions. The Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $50.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. In 2009, the Company expects to record an additional $1.9 million of restructuring charges associated with the restructuring efforts announced in the third quarter of 2008 and approximately $60 million to $80 million associated with the restructuring efforts announced in the first quarter of 2009. Restructuring charges relate mainly to employee termination benefits as well as certain asset writeoffs and ceasing to use certain leased property. Capital Management Fundamental to supporting the Companys business model is its ability to underwrite business, which is largely dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. As a result, in the event that the Company is further downgraded, its ability to write business as well as its financial condition and or results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1, Business Ratings for further information regarding recent rating actions by the various rating agencies, as well as details regarding the Companys financial strength and debt ratings. In relation to the Companys capital position, several activities occurred throughout 2008 and early 2009, including the following: In order to fund payments under the Master Agreement described above, in August 2008, the Company raised approximately $2.8 billion of additional capital through an issuance of both ordinary shares and equity security units (the ESUs). The ESUs consist of: (i) forward purchase contracts to purchase, and the Company to issue, its ordinary shares and (ii) debt securities. For further details relating to the Master Agreement, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Syncora Holdings Ltd. (Syncora). In addition to the payments to Syncora, the Company used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, and the redemption of X.L. America, Inc.s $255 million 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes due April 2011 (the 6.58% Notes) and capital funding of certain of the Companys subsidiaries. Concurrent with the closing of the Master Agreement, the Company exercised the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility entered into in July 2003 resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $500.0 million in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 20,000,000 redeemable Series C Preference Ordinary Shares. On February 27, 2009, the Company initiated a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding Series C Preference Shares. See Capital Resources below for further details relating to the redeemable Series C Preference Ordinary Shares. In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.19 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in September 2008. In addition, in February 2009, the Board of Directors approved a further reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.10 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in March 2009. 74 Following the settlement of the purchase contracts associated with the 7.0% Units in February 2009, the Company issued 11,461,080 Shares for net proceeds of approximately $743.1 million, which was used to retire the senior notes previously due February 2011 which had a fixed coupon of 5.25% (the 2011 Senior Notes). Other capital management initiatives undertaken in 2008 included the following: Upon expiration of the Companys quota share reinsurance treaty with Cyrus Re which reduced the Companys catastrophe exposures, the Company, effective January 1, 2008, entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty with a newly formed Bermuda reinsurance company, Cyrus Re II. Pursuant to the terms of the quota share reinsurance treaty, Cyrus Re II assumed a 10% cession of certain lines of property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocession business underwritten by certain operating subsidiaries of the Company for business that incepted between January 1, 2008 and July 1, 2008. In connection with such cessions, the Company paid Cyrus Re II reinsurance premium less a ceding commission, which included a reimbursement of direct acquisition expenses incurred by the Company as well as a commission to the Company for generating the business. The quota share reinsurance treaty also provided for a profit commission payable to the Company. Following the Companys evaluation of its exposures and the current market conditions, Cyrus Re II was canceled and not renewed at December 31, 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company purchased additional reinsurance including several tranches of industry loss warranty contracts attaching at various levels. Such industry loss warranty contracts were short term in nature and are not considered to be a permanent component of the Companys long term risk management strategy. In relation to catastrophe risk management, the Company considers the loss of capital due to a single large event and the loss of capital that would occur from multiple (but potentially smaller) events in any given year. The Company imposes a limit to catastrophe risk from any single loss in a given region/peril at a 1% exceedance probability. The Company manages its limits to a catastrophe risk from a single loss in a given peril/region at a 1% exceedance probability. Tier 1 limits which include natural catastrophes and other realistic disaster scenarios are targeted at a level not to exceed 15% of tangible shareholders equity, where Tier 2 limits, which include pandemic, longevity and country risk, are established at no more than half of Tier 1 limits. These target limits are established by a combination of commercially available models, internally developed probable maximum loss estimates and the judgment of management. In addition to the above noted key priorities of the Company, other key focuses of management during the year ended December 31, 2008 included the following: Operational Transformation Program In 2008, the Company announced the commencement of a multiple year operational transformation program (the Program) within the Companys Insurance segment that involved the planned transformation of numerous business processes and technology systems into a unified global architecture. However, in January 2009, following a review of this initiative and in light of the current economic climate, the Company refined the scope of the Program to focus on enhancing claims capabilities to strengthen and support the Insurance segments global claims operations. Evaluation of the Impact of Credit Market Volatility on Core Underwriting Operations In addition to the evaluation of the impact of the distressed credit and sub prime markets on the Companys investment portfolio, as discussed above, management has also completed detailed assessments of the exposure to these credit related issues in the core P&C insurance and reinsurance businesses, in particular the Insurance segment professional lines portfolio exposures through D&O and E&O policies. Actual policy notices as well as potential further notice activity that could arise from insureds that have been linked to sub prime related matters are monitored on a monthly basis. Such notice activity is considered in establishing loss and loss expense reserves at each period end. In the Insurance segment, the Company has received a total of 56 policy notices associated with the 2007 report year and 71 policy notices associated with the 2008 report year. For 2007, 54% of gross limits are side A and for 2008, 41% are side A (direct coverage of directors and officers only). 75 During the reserve review process in the first quarter of 2008, the loss ratio for the 2008 reporting year was established to provide a provision for clash type events such as the sub prime crisis was increased by approximately 5 points over the 2007 clash loss ratio. This increase applied to standard professional lines including D&O, E&O and Fiduciary exposures where the sub prime related notice activity has been concentrated. Notice activity during the remainder of 2008 was in line with expectations and no further adjustment was made to the loss ratio established in the first quarter. While loss reserves for professional lines in the 2007 and prior report years have developed favorably in the aggregate during 2008, it should be noted that included within this favorable development is strengthening of the 2007 report year reserves due to the uncertainty associated with sub prime and credit related notice activity. Minor adjustments were made to the current year loss ratios and prior year reserves in the Reinsurance segment professional lines portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, reflecting updated claim activity. Such adjustments had less than a one point impact on the year to date loss ratio for the segment and the reserve strengthening in more recent underwriting years was more than offset by favorable development on older underwriting years within professional lines. Global credit events have also had an impact on the trade credit portfolio written in the European reinsurance operations and this is reflected in the 2008 loss ratios. Foreign Exchange Exposure In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on various items on its financial statements, in particular investments, future policy benefit reserves and unpaid losses and loss expenses. This exposure also exists on certain inter company balances, which are eliminated for consolidation purposes. The Company attempts to manage this economic exposure through matching foreign currency denominated liabilities with foreign currency denominated assets. While unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on underwriting balances may be in certain instances reported in earnings, the offsetting unrealized gains and losses on invested assets are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, to the extent that the asset currency does not match that entitys functional currency. This results in an accounting mismatch that will result in foreign exchange gains or loss in the consolidated statements of income depending on the movement in certain currencies. Management continues to focus on attempting to limit this type of exposure in the future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following are considered to be the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates due to the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and or the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions or estimates applied for any or all of the accounting policies (either individually or in the aggregate), there could be a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Other significant accounting policies are nevertheless important to an understanding of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Policies such as those related to revenue recognition, financial instruments and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies. 1) Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses and Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses Recoverable As the Company earns premiums for the underwriting risks it assumes, it also establishes an estimate of the expected ultimate losses related to the premium. Loss reserves or unpaid losses and loss expenses are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and settlement of a loss. The process of establishing reserves for unpaid property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability, as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional 76 experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. Loss reserves include: (a) Case reserves reserves for reported losses and loss expenses that have not yet been settled; and (b) IBNR losses. Case reserves for the Companys property and casualty operations are established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies and consultation with legal counsel, and represent the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among the Companys operations. With respect to the Companys insurance operations, the Company is notified of insured losses and records a case reserve for the estimated amount of the settlement, if any. The estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of legal counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. With respect to the Companys reinsurance operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the estimated ultimate cost of a loss. The uncertainty in the reserving process for reinsurers is due, in part, to the time lags inherent in reporting from the original claimant to the primary insurer to the reinsurer. As a predominantly broker market reinsurer for both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the Company is subject to a potential additional time lag in the receipt of information as the primary insurer reports to the broker who in turn reports to the Company. As of December 31, 2008, the Company did not have any significant backlog related to its processing of assumed reinsurance information. Since the Company relies on information regarding paid losses, case reserves and IBNR provided by ceding companies in order to assist it in estimating its liability for unpaid losses and LAE, the Company maintains certain procedures in order to help determine the completeness and accuracy of such information. Periodically, management assesses the reporting activities of these companies on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria. In addition to conferring with ceding companies or brokers on claims matters, the Companys claims personnel conduct periodic audits of specific claims and the overall claims procedures of its ceding companies at their offices. The Company relies on its ability to effectively monitor the claims handling and claims reserving practices of ceding companies in order to help establish the proper reinsurance premium for reinsurance agreements and to establish proper loss reserves. Disputes with ceding companies have been rare and generally have been resolved through negotiation. As noted above, case reserves for the Companys reinsurance operations are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the Companys estimated ultimate cost of a loss. In addition to information received from ceding companies on reported claims, the Company also utilizes information on the pattern of ceding company loss reporting and loss settlements from previous catastrophic events in order to estimate the Companys ultimate liability related to these hurricane loss events. Commercial catastrophe model analyses and zonal aggregate exposures are utilized to assess potential client loss before and after an event. Initial cedant loss reports are generally obtained shortly after a catastrophic event, with subsequent updates received as new information becomes available. The Company actively requests loss updates from cedants periodically for the first year following an event. The Companys claim settlement processes also incorporate an update to the total loss reserve at the time a claim payment is made to a ceding company. While the reliance on loss reports from ceding companies may increase the level of uncertainty associated with the estimation of total loss reserves for property reinsurance relative to direct property insurance, there are several factors which serve to reduce the uncertainty in loss reserve estimates for property reinsurance. First, for large natural catastrophe events such as Hurricane Ike, aggregate limits in property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally fully exhausted by the loss reserve estimates. Second, as a reinsurer, the Company has access to information from a broad cross section of the insurance industry. The Company utilizes such information in order to perform consistency checks on the data provided by ceding companies and is able to identify trends in loss reporting and settlement activity and incorporate such information in its estimate of IBNR reserves. Finally, the Company also supplements the 77 loss information received from cedants with loss estimates developed by market share techniques and or from third party catastrophe models applied to exposure data supplied by cedants. With respect to the Companys financial lines operations, financial guarantee claims incurred on policies written on an insurance basis are established consistent with the Companys insurance operations and financial guarantee claims incurred on policies written on a reinsurance basis are established consistent with the Companys reinsurance operations. IBNR reserves represent managements best estimate, at a given point in time, of the amount in excess of case reserves that is needed for the future settlement and loss adjustment costs associated with claims incurred. It is possible that the ultimate liability may differ materially from these estimates. Because the ultimate amount of unpaid losses and LAE is uncertain, the Company believes that quantitative techniques to estimate these amounts are enhanced by professional and managerial judgment. Management reviews the IBNR estimates produced by the Companys actuaries and determines its best estimate of the liabilities to record in the Companys financial statements. The Company considers this single point estimate to be one that has an equal likelihood of developing a redundancy or deficiency as the loss experience matures. IBNR reserves are estimated by the Companys actuaries using several standard actuarial methodologies including the loss ratio method, the loss development or chain ladder method, the Bornhuetter Ferguson (BF) method and frequency and severity approaches. IBNR related to a specific event may be based on the Companys estimated exposure to an industry loss and may include the use of catastrophe modeling software. On a quarterly basis, IBNR reserves are reviewed by the Companys actuaries, and are adjusted as new information becomes available. Any such adjustments are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which they are made. The Companys actuaries utilize one set of assumptions in determining its single point estimate, which includes actual loss data, loss development factors, loss ratios, reported claim frequency and severity. The actuarial reviews and documentation are completed in accordance with professional actuarial standards appropriate to the jurisdictions where the business is written. The selected assumptions reflect the actuarys judgment based on historical data and experience combined with information concerning current underwriting, economic, judicial, regulatory and other influences on ultimate claim settlements. When estimating IBNR reserves, each of the Companys insurance and reinsurance business units segregate business into exposure classes (over 150 classes are reviewed in total). Within each class, the business is further segregated by either the year in which the contract incepted (underwriting year), the year in which the claim occurred (accident year), or the year in which the claim is reported (report year). The majority of the Insurance segment is reviewed on an accident year basis. Professional lines insurance business is reviewed on a report year basis due to the claims made nature of the underlying policies. The majority of the Reinsurance segment is reviewed on an underwriting year basis. Generally, initial actuarial estimates of IBNR reserves not related to a specific event are based on the loss ratio method applied to each class of business. Actual paid losses and case reserves (reported losses) are subtracted from expected ultimate losses to determine IBNR reserves. The initial expected ultimate losses involve management judgment and are based on historical information for that class of business; which includes loss ratios, market conditions, changes in pricing and conditions, underwriting changes, changes in claims emergence, and other factors that may influence expected ultimate losses. Over time, as a greater number of claims are reported, actuarial estimates of IBNR are based on the BF and loss development techniques. The BF method utilizes actual loss data and the expected patterns of loss emergence, combined with an initial expectation of ultimate losses to determine an estimate of ultimate losses. This method may be appropriate when there is limited actual loss data and a relatively less stable pattern of loss emergence. The chain ladder method utilizes actual loss and expected patterns of loss emergence to determine an estimate of ultimate losses that is independent of the initial expectation of ultimate losses. This method may be appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss emergence and a relatively larger number of reported claims. Multiple estimates of ultimate losses using a variety of actuarial methods are calculated for many, but not all, of the Companys (150+) classes of business for each year of loss experience. The Companys actuaries look at each class and determine the most appropriate point estimate based on the characteristics of the particular class and other relevant factors, such as historical ultimate loss ratios, the presence of individual large losses, and known occurrences that have 78 not yet resulted in reported losses. Once the Companys actuaries make their determination of the most appropriate point estimate for each class, this information is aggregated and presented to management for review and approval. The pattern of loss emergence is determined using actuarial analysis, including judgment, and is based on the historical patterns of the recording of paid and reported losses by the Company, as well as industry information. Information that may cause historical patterns to differ from future patterns is considered and reflected in expected patterns as appropriate. For property, marine and aviation insurance, losses are generally reported within 2 to 3 years from the beginning of the accident year. For casualty insurance, loss emergence patterns can vary from 3 years to over 20 years depending on the type of business. For other insurance, loss emergence patterns fall between the property and casualty insurance. For reinsurance business, loss reporting lags the corresponding insurance classes by at least one quarter due to the need for loss information to flow from the ceding companies to the Company generally via reinsurance intermediaries. Such lags in loss reporting are reflected in the actuarys selections of loss reporting patterns used in establishing the Companys reserves. Such estimates are not precise because, among other things, they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity, claim frequency, and other issues. In the process of estimating IBNR reserves, provisions for economic inflation and changes in the social and legal environment are considered, but involve considerable judgment. When estimating IBNR reserves, more judgement is typically required for lines of business with longer loss emergence patterns. Due to the low frequency and high severity nature of some of the business underwritten by the Company, the Companys reserve estimates are highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment and are therefore uncertain. In property classes, there can be additional uncertainty in loss estimation related to large catastrophe events. With wind events, such as hurricanes, the damage assessment process may take more than a year. The cost of claims is subject to volatility due to supply shortages for construction materials and labor. In the case of earthquakes, the damage assessment process may take several years as buildings are discovered to have structural weaknesses not initially detected. The uncertainty inherent in IBNR reserve estimates is particularly pronounced for casualty coverages, such as excess liability, professional liability coverages, and workers compensation, where information emerges relatively slowly over time. The Companys three types of property and casualty reserve exposure with the longest tails are: (1) high layer excess casualty insurance; (2) casualty reinsurance; and (3) discontinued asbestos and long tail environmental business. Certain aspects of the Companys casualty operations complicate the actuarial process for establishing reserves. Certain casualty business written by the Companys insurance operations is high layer excess casualty business, meaning that the Companys liability attaches after large deductibles including self insurance or insurance from sources other than the Company. The Company commenced writing this type of business in 1986 and issued policies in forms that were different from traditional policies used by the industry at that time. Initially, there was a lack of industry data available for this type of business. Consequently, the basis for establishing loss reserves by the Company for this type of business was largely judgmental and based upon the Companys own reported loss experience which was used as basis for determining ultimate losses, and therefore IBNR reserves. Over time, the amount of available historical loss experience data has increased. As a result, the Company has obtained a larger statistical base to assist in establishing reserves for these excess casualty insurance claims. High layer excess casualty insurance claims typically involve claims relating to (i) a shock loss such as an explosion or transportation accident causing severe damage to persons and or property over a short period of time, (ii) a non shock loss where a large number of claimants are exposed to injurious conditions over a longer period of time, such as exposure to chemicals or pharmaceuticals or (iii) a professional liability loss such as a medical malpractice claim. In each case, these claims are ultimately settled following extensive negotiations and legal proceedings. This process can typically take 5 to 15 years following the date of loss. 79 Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications to the reserving process, particularly for casualty business written, in that there is an inherent lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event from an insured or ceding company to the reinsurer. This reporting lag creates an even longer period of time between the policy inception and when a claim is finally settled. As a result, more judgment is required to establish reserves for ultimate claims in the Companys reinsurance operations. In the Companys reinsurance operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the Companys estimated ultimate cost of a loss. Casualty reinsurance business involves reserving methods that generally include historical aggregated claim information as reported by ceding companies, combined with the results of claims and underwriting reviews of a sample of the ceding companys claims and underwriting files. Therefore, the Company does not always receive detailed claim information for this line of business. Discontinued asbestos and long tail environment business had been previously written by NAC Re Corp. (now known as XL Reinsurance America Inc.), prior to its acquisition by the Company. As at December 31, 2008, total gross unpaid losses and loss expenses in respect of this business represented less than 1% of unpaid losses and loss expenses. Except for certain workers compensation liabilities (including long term disability), the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving for workers compensation unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable. For further discussion see the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loss and loss expenses are charged to income as they are incurred. These charges include loss and loss expense payments and any changes in case and IBNR reserves. During the loss settlement period, additional facts regarding claims are reported. As these additional facts are reported, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the unpaid losses and loss expense reserves. The actual final liability may be significantly different than prior estimates. As noted above, management reviews the IBNR estimates produced by the Companys actuaries and determines its best estimate of the liabilities to record in the Companys financial statements. The Company considers this single point estimate to be one that has an equal likelihood of developing a redundancy or deficiency as the loss experience matures. Management believes that the actuarial methods utilized adequately provide for loss development. Management does not build in a provision for uncertainty outside of the estimates prepared by the Companys actuaries. The Companys net unpaid losses and losses expenses (excluding, in 2007, financial guarantee reserves related to reinsurance agreements with Syncora that are recorded within Net loss from operating affiliates) relating to the Companys operating segments at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (U.S. dollars in millions) December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Insurance $ 11,126 $ 11,138 Reinsurance 6,559 7,053 Net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves $ 17,685 $ 18,191 80 (U.S. dollars in millions) Net Unpaid Losses and Loss Expensesas at December 31, 2008 CaseReserves IBNRReserves TotalReserves Insurance Casualty professional lines. $ 1,558 $ 2,764 $ 4,322 Casualty other lines 1,551 2,190 3,741 Property catastrophe (1) 9 14 23 Other property 482 119 601 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 635 534 1,169 Other specialty lines (2) 341 500 841 Other (3) 233 146 379 Structured Indemnity (7 ) 57 50 Total $ 4,802 $ 6,324 $ 11,126 Reinsurance Casualty (4) $ 1,715 $ 2,427 $ 4,142 Property catastrophe (1) 157 148 305 Other property 535 427 962 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 443 72 515 Other (3) 256 301 557 Structured Indemnity 78 78 Total $ 3,106 $ 3,453 $ 6,559 TOTAL $ 7,908 $ 9,777 $ 17,685 (U.S. dollars in millions) Net Unpaid Losses and Loss Expensesas at December 31, 2007 (5) CaseReserves IBNRReserves TotalReserves Insurance Casualty professional lines $ 1,563 $ 2,386 $ 3,949 Casualty other lines 1,644 2,371 4,015 Property catastrophe (1) 22 28 50 Other property 406 154 560 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 649 558 1,207 Other specialty lines (2) 308 434 742 Other (3) 285 189 474 Structured Indemnity 54 87 141 Total $ 4,931 $ 6,207 $ 11,138 Reinsurance Casualty (4) $ 1,966 $ 2,642 $ 4,608 Property catastrophe (1) 122 131 253 Other property 543 447 990 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 488 33 521 Other (3) 297 296 593 Structured Indemnity 88 88 Total $ 3,416 $ 3,637 $ 7,053 TOTAL $ 8,347 $ 9,844 $ 18,191 (1) Property and catastrophe IBNR includes event specific reserves for losses that the Companys insureds and cedants have informed the Company they expect to incur but have not yet had reported known claims. (2) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, specie, middle markets and excess and surplus lines. (3) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. (4) Within the Reinsurance segment, casualty other and casualty professional lines of business are shown in the aggregate. (5) Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to current year presentation. 81 While the proportion of unpaid losses and loss expenses represented by IBNR is sensitive to a number of factors, the most significant ones have historically been accelerated business growth and changes in business mix. Other factors that have affected the ratio in the past include additions to prior period reserves, catastrophic occurrences, settlement of large claims and changes in claims settlement patterns. The ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased in recent years due to the growth of casualty business written over that period. The ratio of IBNR to total reserves is higher for more recent years business because these immature years have relatively fewer claims reported and, as a result, a higher proportion of claims reserves are based on experience in respect of incurred but not reported losses. As each prior year of business matures and claims become known, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. Since the Company has experienced premium volume growth in recent years, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased because the Companys aggregate exposure has become relatively less mature. Conversely, in a situation of declining premium volume, this ratio will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. The Company writes insurance and reinsurance business in many different lines. Typically, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves is greater for casualty lines (which are longer tail in nature) than for property lines due to the policy forms utilized and timing of loss reporting. In recent years, casualty lines have increased as a proportion of the Companys business when compared to property lines (which are shorter tail in nature). IBNR reserves are calculated by the Companys actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies as discussed above. Since the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company adopted a methodology that provides a single point reserve estimate separately for each line of business and also a range of possible outcomes across each single point reserve estimate. This is discussed further below. The following table shows the recorded estimate and the high and low ends of the range of the Companys net unpaid losses and loss expenses (excluding, in 2007, financial guarantee reserves related to reinsurance agreements with Syncora that are recorded within Net loss from operating affiliates) for each of the lines of business noted above at December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in millions) Net UnpaidLosses and LossExpensesRecorded as atDecember 31, 2008 Range of NetUnpaid Losses &Loss ExpensesEstimated as atDecember 31,2008 Range of NetUnpaid Losses &Loss ExpensesEstimated as atDecember 31,2008 High Low Insurance Casualty professional lines $ 4,322 $ 4,828 $ 3,838 Casualty other lines. 3,741 4,221 3,284 Property catastrophe (1) 23 26 20 Other property 601 689 517 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite. 1,169 1,260 1,080 Other specialty lines (2) 841 914 771 Other (3) 379 432 329 Total (5) $ 11,076 $ 12,053 $ 10,131 Reinsurance Casualty (4) $ 4,142 $ 4,554 $ 3,759 Property catastrophe (1) 305 356 257 Other property 962 1,061 872 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite. 515 591 445 Other (3) 557 646 479 Total (5) $ 6,481 $ 7,005 $ 5,989 Structured Indemnity (5) $ 128 Total $ 17,685 (1) Property and catastrophe IBNR includes event specific reserves for losses that the Companys insureds and cedants have informed it they expect to incur but have not yet had reported known claims. 82 (2) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, and excess and surplus lines.

(4) Within the Reinsurance segment, casualty other and casualty professional lines of business are shown in the aggregate. (5) The range for the total Insurance and Reinsurance segment reserves is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business shown in the table due to diversification benefits across the lines of business. In addition, the total for each of the Insurance and Reinsurance segments does not include reserves relating to structured indemnity business as the Company does not develop reserve ranges for this line of business. Actual development of recorded reserves as of December 31, 2007 during 2008 was within the estimated reserve range. There are factors that would cause reserves to increase or decrease within the context of the range provided. The magnitude of any change in ultimate losses would be determined by the magnitude of any changes to the Companys assumptions or combined impact of changes in assumptions. Factors that would increase reserves include, but are not limited to, increases in claim severity, increases in expected level of reported claims, changes to the regulatory environment which expand the exposure insured by the Company, changes in the litigation environment that increase claim awards, filings or verdicts, unexpected increases in loss inflation, and or new types of claims being pursued against the Company. Factors that would decrease reserves include, but are not limited to, decreases in claim severity, reductions in the expected level of reported claims, changes to the regulatory environment which contract the exposure insured by the Company, changes in the litigation environment that decrease claim awards, filings or verdicts, and or unexpected decreases in loss inflation. The Companys methodology in 2008 for calculating reserve ranges around its single point reserve estimate is consistent with that used in 2007. The Company modeled a statistical distribution of potential reserve outcomes over a one year run off period for each of the approximately 35 lines of business. In doing so the Company evaluated a number of alternative models, and for each line of business the Companys actuaries selected the one deemed to be most appropriate. Factors affecting this decision included an assessment of the model fit, availability and relevance of data and the impact of changes in business mix. The Company used the modeled statistical distribution to calculate an 80% confidence interval for the potential reserve outcomes over this one year run off period. The high and low end points of the ranges set forth in the above table are such that there is a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop higher than the high point and a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop lower than the low point. The development of a reserve range models the uncertainty of the claim environment as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data. These uncertainties and limitations are not specific to the Company. The ranges represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes over a one year development period. A range of possible outcomes should not be confused with a range of best estimates. The range of best estimates will generally be much narrower than the range of possible outcomes as it will reflect reasonable actuarial and management best estimates of the expected reserve. Reserve volatility was analyzed for each line of business (excluding structured indemnity) within each of the Reinsurance and Insurance segments using the Companys historical data supplemented by industry data. These ranges were then aggregated to the lines of business shown above taking into account correlation between lines of business. The practical result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges by line of business disclosed above, are narrower than the sum of the ranges of the individual lines of business. Similarly, the range for the Companys total reserves in the aggregate, is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business disclosed above. During 2006, the Company reviewed the correlation assumptions between its various lines of business. There was growth in certain lines of business as well as changes in the groupings of the data used in the reserving process. These changes necessitated a review of the correlation matrix used to develop the Companys reserve ranges. The Company took a simplified approach of assigning ratings of low, medium or high to its correlation assumptions for each line of business pairing based on the judgment of the reserving actuaries, as there was both limited historical experience within its portfolio and limited applicable industry data. However, the Companys actual historical experience and industry data were used to judgmentally select a range of values for the low, medium and high correlations, respectively, of 15%, 30% and 50%. It should be noted that both the Companys own experience and the industry data exhibit 83 negative correlations in reserve developments between certain lines of business. However, as a measure of prudence in evaluating the reserve ranges, the Company has used a minimum of 15% correlation between any two lines of business. The analysis of correlations and the reflection of potential diversification benefits across lines of business represent another area of uncertainty in the development of estimated reserve ranges. The Company is not aware of any generally accepted model to perform the reserve range analysis described above, however, and other models may be employed to develop these ranges. See further discussion under Segments below for prior year development of loss reserves. Financial Guarantee Loss Reserving The Company had reserves for financial guarantee insurance contracts of $14.5 million and $427.4 million, respectively, recorded within Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses, at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2007 the most significant financial guarantee exposures were related to the Companys reinsurance agreements with Syncora and its subsidiaries. Following the closing of the Master Agreement, the Companys financial guarantee exposures associated with Syncora were eliminated, with the exception of the guarantee of Syncoras obligations under certain policies with European Investment Bank which are not subject to FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 163 Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts, an interpretation of FAS 60 (FAS 163), which is effective January 1, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the Companys outstanding financial guarantee contracts that were subject to FAS 163 included the reinsurance of 48 financial guarantee contracts with total insured contractual payments outstanding of $936.6 million ($798.5 million of principal and $138.1 million of interest) with a remaining weighted average contract period of 7.9 years. The total gross claim liability and unearned premiums recorded at December 31, 2008 were $14.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Of the contractual exposure existing at December 31, 2008, the Company has reinsured $360.5 million with a third party. There are no gross claim liabilities or recoverables recorded relating to this exposure. Surveillance procedures to track and monitor credit deteriorations in the insured financial obligations are performed by the primary obligors for each transaction on the Companys behalf. Information regarding the performance status and updated exposure values is provided to the Company on a quarterly basis and evaluated by management in recording claims reserves. Of the 48 contracts noted above, 5 contracts with total insured contractual payments outstanding of $18.4 million had experienced an event of default and were considered by the Company to be non performing at December 31, 2008, while the remaining 43 contracts were considered to be performing at such date. Management establishes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on such business based on managements best estimate of the ultimate expected incurred losses. The Companys estimated ultimate expected incurred losses are comprised of: (i) case basis reserves, (ii) unallocated reserves, and (iii) cumulative paid losses to date. Establishment of such reserves requires the use and exercise of significant judgment by management, including with respect to estimates regarding the occurrence and amount of a loss on an insured obligation. Estimates of losses may differ from actual results and such difference may be material, due to the fact that the ultimate dispositions of claims are subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred. Examples of these events include changes in the level of interest rates, credit deterioration of insured obligations, and changes in the value of specific assets supporting insured obligations. Both qualitative and quantitative factors are used in establishing such reserves. In determining the reserves, management considers all factors in the aggregate, and does not attribute the reserve provisions or any portion thereof to any specific factor. Any estimate of future costs is subject to the inherent limitation on the Companys ability to predict the aggregate course of future events. It should therefore be expected that the actual emergence of losses and loss adjustment expenses will vary, perhaps materially, from any estimate. The amount of the case basis reserve is based on the net present value of the expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense payments that the Company expects to make, net of expected recoveries under salvage and subrogation rights. Case basis reserves are determined using cash flow or similar models to estimate the net present value of the anticipated shortfall between (i) scheduled payments on the insured 84 obligation plus anticipated loss adjustment expenses and (ii) anticipated cash flow from the proceeds to be received on sales of any collateral supporting the obligation and other anticipated recoveries. A number of quantitative and qualitative factors are considered when determining or assessing, in managements judgment, the need for a case basis reserve. These factors may include the creditworthiness of the underlying issuer of the insured obligation, whether the obligation is secured or unsecured, the projected cash flow or market value of any assets that collateralize or secure the insured obligation, and the historical and projected loss rates on such assets. Other factors that may affect the actual ultimate loss include the state of the economy, changes in interest rates, rates of inflation and the salvage values of specific collateral. Case basis reserves are generally discounted at a rate reflecting the yield on the Companys investment portfolio during the period the case basis reserve is established. The Company believes this yield is an appropriate rate to discount the Companys reserves because it reflects the rate of return on the assets supporting such business. When a case basis reserve is established for a guaranteed obligation whose premium is paid on an upfront basis, the Company continues to record premium earnings on such policy over its remaining life, unless it has recorded a full limit loss with respect to such policy, in which case the remaining deferred premium revenue relating thereto is immediately reflected in earnings. When a case basis reserve is established for a guaranteed obligation whose premium is paid on an installment basis, those premiums, if expected to be received prospectively, are considered a form of recovery netted against the loss reserves and are no longer earned as premium revenue. In addition to case basis reserves, the Company maintains an unallocated loss reserve for expected losses inherent in the Companys in force business (consisting of both financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance business) that is expected to emerge in the future. The unallocated loss reserves represent the Companys estimated ultimate liability from claims expected to be incurred in the future under in force insured and reinsured policies less outstanding case basis reserves and cumulative paid claims to date on such policies. Unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable The recognition of unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves the Companys estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of the Companys loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Unpaid losses and loss expenses and unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable). The second judgment involves the Companys estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that the Company will ultimately be unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance and shareholders equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. See Item 8, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Reinsurance, for further information. The Company uses a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, estimated recovery rates and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurers balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by the Company with the same legal entity for which the Company believes there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. 2) Future Policy Benefit Reserves Future policy benefit reserves relate to the Companys life operations and are estimated using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, expenses and provisions for adverse loss deviation. Uncertainties related to interest rate volatility and mortality experience make it difficult to project and value the ultimate benefit payments. 85 Most of the Companys future policy benefit reserves relate to annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts under which the Company makes annuity payments throughout the term of the contract for a specified portfolio of policies. For certain of these contracts, a single premium is paid at inception of the contract by way of a transfer of cash and investments to the Company. The reserving methodology for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts is described in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60 Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises (FAS 60), as amended by FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97 Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments (FAS 97). These contracts subject the Company to risks arising from policyholder mortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected. Liabilities for future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60. Claims and expenses for individual policies within these annuity reinsurance contracts are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows. Assumptions for each element of the basis (mortality, expenses and interest) are determined at the issue of the contract and these assumptions are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists. The assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements (i.e., mortality and interest). Provisions for adverse deviation are designed to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimate outcome of the contract. As the experience on the contracts emerges, the assumptions are reviewed. This occurs at least annually and includes both an analysis of experience and review of likely future experience. If such review would produce reserves in excess of those currently held then lock in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no adjustments to the locked in assumptions for these annuity reinsurance contracts. The future policy benefit reserves for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts amounted to $4.4 billion and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. The Company holds the investment assets backing these liabilities. These investments are primarily fixed income securities with maturities that closely match the expected claims settlement profile. A 0.1% decrease in the investment yield assumption would result in approximately a $28 million increase in the value of future claims related to annuity portfolio reinsurance. As stated above, the future policy benefit reserves include provisions for adverse deviation in excess of best estimate assumptions that amounted to approximately $178 million and $410 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The future policy benefit reserves would only be increased if these provisions for adverse deviation became insufficient in the light of emerging claims experience. The present value of future claims would increase by approximately $17 million if mortality rates were to decrease by 1% in all future years, relative to the reserving assumptions. The Company also provides reinsurance of disability income protection, for an in force block of business. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $97 million and $90 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide an income if the policyholder becomes sick or disabled. The liabilities are therefore driven mainly by the rates at which policyholders become sick (where sickness is defined by the policy conditions) and by the rates at which these policyholders recover or die. A 1% increase in the incidence rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $1.6 million, while a 1% decrease in the termination rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $3.0 million. While no changes to the locked in assumptions were made in 2007, following a review of claim termination experience in 2008, the reserving assumptions were revised, resulting in a reduction in income of $10.0 million during the year. The Company also provides reinsurance of term assurance and critical illness policies written in the U.K., Ireland and the US. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $279 million and $242 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock in of assumptions at 86 inception with periodic review against experience. The provisions for adverse deviation in these reserves amounted to approximately $25 million and $22 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business and to treaties accepting new business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies or becomes sick. For term assurance, the liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality and for critical illness cover, the liabilities are driven predominantly by the rates at which policyholders become sick, where sickness is defined by the treaty conditions (i.e., the morbidity rates). A 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $2.5 million, and a 1% increase in the morbidity rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $2.0 million. The term assurance and critical illness treaties have been written using a variety of structures, some of which incur acquisition costs during an initial period. For such treaties, a deferred acquisition cost (DAC) asset has been established and an increase in future lapse rates could impact the recoverability of such costs from future premiums. The recoverability will also be influenced by the impact of lapses on future claims. An increase in the annual lapse rates by 1% could lead to a 5% 10% reduction in future margins available for amortizing the DAC asset. The Company also provided reinsurance of a block of U.S. based term assurance, which was novated to the Company from an insurance affiliate in December 2002. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $254 million and $245 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of FAS 60, including the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business, which are comprised of underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies. The liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality, and a 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $9 million. The liabilities are also affected by lapse experience, and a 1% decrease in lapse rates relative to the reserving assumption would increase the reserve by approximately $1.5 million. While no changes to the locked in assumptions were made in 2008, following a review of mortality and lapse experience in 2007, the locked in assumptions were revised, resulting in a reduction in income of $25.4 million during the year. For further information see Item 8, Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Future Policy Benefit Reserves. 3) Deposit Liabilities The Companys deposit liabilities at December 31, 2008 reflect obligations assumed under funding agreements, payment undertaking agreements and certain structured insurance and reinsurance agreements. Previously, deposit liabilities included GICs; however, based on the terms and conditions of the underlying GICs, upon the downgrade of Syncora Guarantee below certain ratings levels, all or portions of outstanding principal balances on such GICs would come due. Throughout 2008, several rating agencies downgraded Syncora and its subsidiaries and as a result, the Company settled, during 2008, all of the GIC liabilities. For existing deposit liability contracts at December 31, 2008, the Company establishes a deposit liability equal to the net cash received at inception. Each deposit liability accrues at a rate equal to the internal rate of return of the payment receipts and obligations due during the life of the agreement. Where the timing and or amount of future payments are uncertain, cash flows reflecting the Companys actuarially determined best estimates are utilized. The ultimate size of underlying losses, the impact of the contractual limits upon settlement of such losses, and the impact of the underlying loss settlement process on the timing of payments are considered as appropriate. Where uncertainty is present, an increase in the ultimate claims cost or accelerated claims settlement would potentially lead to an increase in the deposit liability accretion rate or lead to incurred losses if significant. The interest expense reported due to the accretion of deposit liabilities associated with structured insurance and reinsurance contracts was $74.8 million, $76.6 million and $37.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For some of the Companys deposit liabilities, the accretion rate is recorded at its contractual maximum level. For all other contracts, a 1% increase in the average accretion rate would result in an increase in deposit liabilities and 87 interest expense by $23.7 million on an annualized basis. See Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Deposit Liabilities. 4) Derivative Instruments With regards to derivative instruments, the Company conducts activities mainly in investment related derivative instruments, which may include credit derivatives. In addition, outside of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company previously wrote credit derivatives and weather and energy derivatives. The estimate of fair value for credit derivatives and weather and energy derivatives requires managements judgment. These two activities are discussed below: a) Credit Derivatives Credit derivatives are purchased within the Companys investment portfolio, have been sold through a limited number of contracts written as part of the Companys previous XL Financial Solutions business, and were previously entered into through the Companys prior reinsurance agreements with Syncora, as described below. From time to time, the Company may purchase credit default swaps to hedge an existing position or concentration of holdings. The credit derivatives are recorded at fair value. Following the secondary sale of Syncora common shares, the Company retained some credit derivative exposures written by Syncora and certain of its subsidiaries through reinsurance agreements that had certain derivatives exposures embedded within them. Subsequent to June 6, 2007, the Company received Syncora related derivative fair values from Syncora management and reviewed the methodology applied in developing those estimates. In addition, the change in value of the derivative portion of the financial guarantee reinsurance agreements the Company had with Syncora was included in Net (loss) income from operating affiliates. Following the closing of the Master Agreement which terminated certain reinsurance and other agreements, these credit derivative exposures were eliminated by virtue of the commutation of the relevant reinsurance agreements. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining credit derivative exposure outside of the Companys investment portfolio consisted of 23 contracts written by the Company that provide credit protection on senior tranches of structured finance transactions with total net par values outstanding of $639.5 million, a weighted average contractual term to maturity of 5.7 years, a total liability recorded of $28.6 million, and an average rating of AA on the underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2008, there have been no reported events of default on the underlying obligations. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for sensitivity analysis and Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments. b) Weather and Energy Derivatives The fair value of previously written weather and energy derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices where available. Where quoted market prices are unavailable, the fair value is estimated using available market data and internal pricing models using consistent statistical methodologies. Estimating fair value of instruments that do not have quoted market prices requires managements judgment in determining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in settlement of the contracts. The amounts could be materially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect managements best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, actual and forecasted weather conditions, changes in commodity prices, changes in interest rates and other market factors. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for sensitivity analysis and Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments. 5) Other Than Temporary Declines in Investments The Companys process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors. These primary factors include (i) the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value, (ii) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and financial condition of the issuer, (iii) the significance of the decline, (iv) an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question, (v) expected future interest 88 rate movements, and (vi) the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for the value to recover. In addition, EITF 99 20 requires that OTTI for certain asset backed and mortgage backed securities are recognized if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last reporting period. Where the Companys analysis of the above factors results in the Companys conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to fair value and the previously unrealized loss is therefore realized in the period such determination is made. With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the securitys value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring, changing information, market conditions generally and assessing value relative to other comparable securities. Day to day management of the Companys investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss, based upon a change in market and other factors described above. The Company believes that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the Companys portfolio as available for sale. As mentioned above, the Company considers its intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers as part of the process of evaluating whether a securitys unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline. Management reviews any significant sales of securities for a loss to determine if such sale impacts the assertion with respect to the intent and ability to hold to recovery. For further details on managements assessment of OTTI, see Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments. However, this factor on its own does not dictate whether or not the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company believes its ability to hold such securities is supported by positive and sufficient cash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payment obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments. In this regard, cash flow from operating activities, excluding the payment to Syncora under the Master Agreement, was $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion in 2008 and 2007, respectively. There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in general economic conditions as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, the Companys liability profile, subjective assessment of issue specific factors (seniority of claims, collateral value, etc.), future financial market effects, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant disclosure of accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, significant assumptions and management judgment are involved in determining if the decline is other than temporary. If management determines that a decline in fair value is temporary, then a securitys value is not written down at that time. However, there are potential effects upon the Companys future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of the investments are other than temporary declines. See Investment Activities for further information on other than temporary declines in the value of investments and unrealized loss on investments. 6) Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company had capitalized net operating tax losses of $301.3 million and $396.9 million against which a valuation allowance of $224.3 million and $204.4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, was established. The Company had capitalized realized and unrealized capital losses of approximately $196.3 million and $134.6 million, respectively, against which a valuation allowance of approximately $327.4 million at December 31, 2008 was established. Included within the capitalized realized losses are $173.7 million of losses arising from the sale of investments to a group company, 89 against which a valuation allowance of $173.7 million has been established. The deferral of benefits from tax losses is evaluated based upon managements estimates of the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities based on current forecasts, the character of income and the period for which losses may be carried forward. A valuation allowance may have to be established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. Should the future income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance would have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax affected. For further information see Other Revenues and Expenses and Item 8, Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxation. 7) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company has recorded goodwill in connection with various acquisitions in prior years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142), the Company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate that potential exists for the fair value of a reporting unit to be reduced to a level below its carrying amount. The Company tests for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally one level below its business segments. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in FAS 142. The first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the estimated book value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is derived based upon valuation techniques and assumptions the Company believes market participants would use to value the business. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are generally determined utilizing methodologies that incorporate discounted cash flow analyses, price to net tangible book, and price to earnings multiples of certain comparable companies. The Company derives the net book value of its reporting units by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated book value, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing, as of June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, which did not result in any goodwill impairment. However, due to the financial market and economic events that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test for goodwill subsequent to its annual testing date of June 30. The interim impairment test resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $990.0 million. The charge relates primarily to certain reinsurance units goodwill associated with the merger of Mid Ocean in 1998. The fair value of the Mid Ocean reporting unit was calculated using the methodologies noted above and by comparison with similar companies using their publicly traded price multiples as the basis for valuation. Other intangible assets include licenses of certain subsidiaries of the Company in various jurisdictions that allow such subsidiaries to write insurance and or reinsurance business. These intangible assets are carried at or below estimated fair value and consistent with goodwill, are tested on an annual basis for impairment, or more frequently, if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred. Consistent with goodwill, there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculation. Principally, the Company identifies the business entity that the intangible asset is attributed to, and reviews historical and forecasted performance and other underlying factors affecting such analysis, including market conditions, premium rates and loss trends. Other assumptions used could produce a significantly different result which may result in a change in the value of the intangible asset and related amortization charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Based on the current expectations of profitability, an impairment charge would only be recognized in the event of a significant decline in the expected profitability of those operations where such intangible assets are applicable. After recording the impairments as described above, the Company has goodwill of $824.8 million remaining as at December 31, 2008, of which $426.7 million relates to the Companys Insurance segment while $398.1 million relates to the Companys Reinsurance segment. 90 For further information, see Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 8) Reinsurance Premium Estimates The Company writes business on both an excess of loss and proportional basis. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the subject written premium is generally outlined within the treaty and the Company receives a minimum and or deposit premium on a quarterly basis which is normally followed by an adjustment premium based on the ultimate subject premium for the contract. The Company estimates the premium written on the basis of the expected subject premium and regularly reviews this against actual quarterly statements to revise the estimate based on the information provided by the cedant. On proportional contracts, written premiums are estimated to expected ultimate premiums based on information provided by the ceding companies. An estimate of premium is recorded at the inception of the contract. The ceding companys premium estimate may be adjusted based on their history of providing accurate premium estimates. When the actual premium is reported by the ceding company, normally on a quarterly basis, it may be materially higher or lower than the estimate. Adjustments arising from the reporting of actual premium by the ceding companies are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Written premiums on excess of loss contracts are earned in accordance with the loss occurring period defined within the treaty, normally 12 months following inception of the contract. Written premiums on proportional contracts are earned over the risk periods of the underlying policies issued and renewed, normally 24 months. For both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the earned premium is recognized ratably over the earning period, namely 12 24 months. The portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected in unearned premiums. Reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre defined contract terms and are fully earned when recognized. Accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on the Companys estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which involves management judgment as described below. Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications in that generally the ultimate premium due under a specific contract will not be known at the time the contract is entered into. As a result, more judgment and ongoing monitoring is required to establish premiums written and earned in the Companys reinsurance operations. The amount of premiums receivable related to the Companys reinsurance operations amounted to $1.7 billion as at December 31, 2008. A significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable, which represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions, are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Management reviews the premiums receivable balance at least quarterly and provides a provision for amounts deemed to be uncollectible. The Company recorded a provision for uncollectible premiums receivable related to its reinsurance operations at December 31, 2008 of $19.0 million. 91 The amount of proportional and excess of loss reinsurance gross premiums written and gross acquisition expenses recognized by the Companys reinsurance operations for each line of business for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was as follows: (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses Proportional Contracts: Property catastrophe $ $ $ $ $ $ Casualty other lines 47,791 16,777 133,444 52,062 370,780 59,274 Casualty professional lines 62,268 20,772 47,361 23,413 58,533 46,796 Other property 745,244 148,066 739,130 201,170 774,984 205,362 Marine, energy, aviation and satellite 32,935 14,101 47,359 14,981 56,866 11,092 Other (1) 197,418 25,339 222,374 37,177 340,122 72,668 Structured Indemnity Total Proportional contracts $ 1,085,656 $ 225,055 $ 1,189,668 $ 328,803 $ 1,601,285 $ 395,192 (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2008 December 31,2007 December 31,2006 GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses Excess of loss Contracts: Property catastrophe $ 401,740 $ 30,688 $ 475,540 $ 46,621 $ 449,312 $ 39,368 Casualty other lines 308,932 50,565 409,807 69,133 289,674 6,816 Casualty professional lines 151,251 29,696 208,919 45,476 239,429 84,063 Other property 202,655 18,096 231,066 21,724 274,875 21,361 Marine, energy, aviation and satellite 86,658 9,191 103,189 11,121 120,061 13,002 Other (1) 22,914 8,792 17,044 2,956 20,216 2,530 Structured Indemnity 671 2,699 28,261 374 71,286 645 Total Excess of loss contracts $ 1,174,821 $ 149,727 $ 1,473,826 $ 197,405 $ 1,464,853 $ 167,785 (1) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. 92 Segments The Company is organized into four operating segments: Insurance, Reinsurance, Life Operations, and Other Financial Lines in addition to a Corporate segment that includes the general investment and financing operations of the Company. The Companys Insurance and Reinsurance segments are sometimes collectively referred to as property and casualty or P&C operations. The Company evaluates the performance for both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments based on underwriting profit and evaluates the contribution from each of the Life Operations and Other Financial Lines segments. Other items of revenue and expenditure of the Company are not evaluated at the segment level for reporting purposes. In addition, the Company does not allocate investment assets by segment for its property and casualty operations. Investment assets related to (i) the Companys Life Operations and Other Financial Lines segments and (ii) certain structured products included in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments are held in separately identified portfolios. As such, net investment income from these assets is included in the contribution from each of these segments. Income Statement Analysis Insurance The following table summarizes the underwriting profit (loss) for the Insurance segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2008 % Change08 vs 07 2007 % Change07 vs 06 2006 Gross premiums written $ 5,308,914 (2.3 )% $ 5,434,266 (3.4 )% $ 5,627,293 Net premiums written 3,984,826 (4.8 )% 4,186,855 0.1 % 4,185,372 Net premiums earned 3,997,045 (2.9 )% 4,116,588 (1.0 )% 4,159,323 Fee income and other 42,548 NM * 11,812 (51.6 )% 24,425 Net losses and loss expenses. 2,733,344 5.3 % 2,594,812 (4.8 )% 2,726,847 Acquisition costs 465,044 (3.9 )% 484,014 (2.7 )% 497,367 Operating expenses 734,749 7.6 % 683,108 6.7 % 640,470 Underwriting profit $ 106,456 (71.0 )% $ 366,466 14.9 % $ 319,064 Exchange (gains) losses $ (28,815 ) NM * $ 29,567 (78.9 )% $ 140,248 Net results structured products $ (14,713 ) NM * $ (2,480 ) NM * $ 6,895 * NM Not Meaningful Gross premiums written decreased by 2.3% during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with 2007, primarily as a result of continued decreases in premium rates as market conditions continued to soften, a reduction in long term agreements in late 2008, selective non renewals and to a lesser extent, lost business opportunities associated with rating agency downgrades that occurred in 2008. Such decreases in gross premiums written were primarily within casualty and professional lines of business as well as certain specialty lines including environmental, aerospace and marine portfolios. Partially offsetting these decreases was growth in certain property lines, particularly in the construction book in Europe, as well as excess and surplus and middle market lines and favorable foreign exchange rate movements totaling $108.4 million. Net premiums written decreased by 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the decrease in gross premiums written described above coupled with an increase in ceded premiums written associated with growth in certain property lines, change in the mix of business including an increase in long term agreements with higher cession ratios, the impact from the purchase of an adverse development cover associated with a Company owned Lloyds syndicate and unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts of $29.6 million. Gross premiums written decreased by 3.4% during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with the year ended 2006, while net premiums written increased slightly during the same period. Decreases in gross premiums written were due primarily to a combination of a decrease in rates, reduced shares and selective non renewals in certain property and marine lines of business, as well as the runoff of certain property catastrophe exposures. Partially offsetting these decreases was growth in the excess and surplus book of business in the U.S., increases in the number of long term agreements, strong new business and higher renewal retentions within certain casualty lines of business, and favorable foreign exchange rate 93 movements. Net premiums written increased slightly as the reduction in ceded premiums written was mostly offset by the reduction in gross premiums written noted above. Ceded premiums written decreased as a result of favorable outward reinsurance pricing conditions, increased retention related to certain captive programs and marine and energy treaties, as well as refunds associated with property catastrophe programs. Partially offsetting the decrease in ceded premiums was the impact of return premium associated with the commutation of ceded reinsurance policies in professional lines of business in 2006. Net premiums earned decreased by 2.9% in 2008 as compared 2007 and by 1.0% in 2007 as compared to 2006. These decreases were primarily a reflection of the overall reduction of net premiums written over the last 12 to 24 months. Fee income increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly as a result of higher engineering fee revenue associated with XL GAPS, which formed in late 2007 following the acquisition of GAPS, a loss prevention consulting service provider. Fee income and other decreased in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to a favorable legal settlement recorded in 2006 in relation to a U.K. contract as well as certain foreign exchange adjustments recorded in 2006. The following table presents the ratios for the Insurance segment for each of the last three years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 Loss and loss expense ratio 68.4 % 63.0 % 65.6 % Underwriting expense ratio 30.0 % 28.4 % 27.4 % Combined ratio 98.4 % 91.4 % 93.0 % The loss and loss expense ratio noted above includes net losses incurred for both the current year and any favorable or adverse prior year development of loss and loss expense reserves held at the beginning of the year. The following table summarizes the net (favorable) adverse prior year development by line of business relating to the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Property $ (106.0 ) $ (95.0 ) $ (94.4 ) Casualty and Professional (214.1 ) (139.1 ) 5.4 Specialty and Other 9.6 76.0 75.8 Structured Indemnity 5.0 Total $ (305.5 ) $ (158.1 ) $ (13.2 ) Loss and loss expense ratio excluding prior year development 76.0 % 66.9 % 65.9 % In addition, the following tables present the prior year (favorable) adverse development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves within the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: Gross: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 14,856 $ 14,528 $ 14,756 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (610 ) (178 ) (371 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 14,246 $ 14,350 $ 14,385 Net: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 11,138 $ 10,608 $ 9,950 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (305 ) (158 ) (13 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 10,833 $ 10,450 $ 9,937 94 Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 9.1 loss percentage points as compared to 2007 with 2.6 points of the loss ratio increase attributable to a higher level of catastrophe losses in the current year, including the impacts of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, which resulted in net incurred losses in the Companys Insurance segment of $54.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums. The remainder of the increase in loss ratio was attributable to an increase in loss activity in property, loss activity anticipated for professional lines related to sub prime and related credit events, premium adjustments booked in the third and fourth quarters as well as the softening rate environment impacting most lines of business. Net favorable prior year development in the year ended December 31, 2008, totaled $305.5 million, primarily due to reserve releases in certain casualty lines primarily in 2003 to 2006 accident years due to lower than expected reported loss activity and favorable reserve development in global property lines of business as a result of favorable claim development. In addition, net reserve releases resulted from an agreement with Axa/Winterthur of approximately $80.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in regards to certain reinsurance recoverable balances relating to casualty lines and to a lesser extent, certain property lines of business. Offsetting this favorable development was modest reserve strengthening within specialty lines, primarily in the environmental lines of business, as well as strengthening associated with certain structured indemnity contracts. Within the professional lines, reserve releases in the 2003 to 2006 accident years were largely offset by strengthening of reserves in the 2007 year. Gross prior year favorable development for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $609.6 million exceeded the corresponding net favorable development during the same period of $305.5 million, as the impact of reductions in gross reported losses on older years in certain casualty lines was mostly offset by the impact of the reinsurance recoverable component on such losses. In addition, the impact of gross reserve releases in professional and specialty lines was mostly offset by the impact of a reduction in estimated ceded IBNR following reserve reviews in these lines. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net prior year reserve releases in the Insurance segment consisted of $95.0 million in property and $162.1 million in casualty lines of business, partially offset by net adverse development of $23.0 million, $7.0 million and $69.0 million in certain professional, marine and other lines of business, respectively. Casualty releases relate primarily to the European casualty portfolio in accident years 2002 2005. The professional lines development reflects net adverse prior year development of the Bermuda E&O portfolio and releases from the U.S. and European professional lines portfolios. Strengthening in other insurance lines relates to adverse development in discontinued specialty lines, surety and environmental, partially offset by favorable development in aerospace and political risk. Gross prior year development was also favorable at $177.6 million. Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio increased by 1.0 point partly due to an increase in attritional and catastrophe related property experience and partly due to softening market conditions primarily in certain specialty lines. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, was due to an increase in the operating expense ratio of 1.8 points (18.4% as compared to 16.6%) and partially offset by a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.2 points (11.6% as compared to 11.8%). The increase in the operating expense ratio was mainly as a result of a higher headcount which increased compensation, increases in professional fees and the impact of employee termination benefits recorded in the latter half of 2008, against lower net premiums earned. The increase in headcount and professional fees both supported new segment initiatives as well as the formation of XL GAPS in late 2007. Offsetting these increases in 2008 were decreases in performance related compensation. The acquisition expense ratio decreased mainly due to a reduction in foreign excise taxes as a result of a decrease in the cession percentage of an internal quota share from 75% to 50%, lower guarantee fund assessments and the impact of changes in the mix of business written. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to the same period in 2006 was due to an increase in the operating expense ratio of 1.2 points (16.6% as compared to 15.4%), partially offset by a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.2 points (11.8% as compared to 12.0%). The increase in the operating expense ratio was due primarily to higher compensation costs associated with higher head count and corporate allocations, and was partially offset by adjustments booked in 2007 relating to previously accrued regulatory costs. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio resulted primarily from an increase in outward reinsurance profit commissions as well as favorable 95 prior year premium adjustments. Offsetting these decreases was the impact of a reduction in certain ceded brokerage costs in 2006. Foreign exchange gains in the year ended December 31, 2008 and foreign exchange losses in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were due primarily to the change in the value of the U.S. dollar against certain European currencies including the U.K. Sterling and the Euro on certain inter company balances. Net results from structured insurance products include certain structured indemnity contracts that are accounted for as deposit contracts. Results from these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to lower net investment income and higher operating expenses, partially offset by lower interest expense. Net investment income decreased as a result of lower yields earned on investment income while operating expenses increased as a result of costs recorded in the latter half of 2008 associated with employee termination benefits relating to the closure of the XLFS business unit as noted above. Interest expense decreased mainly due to negotiated cancellation of certain contracts in 2008 that resulted in gains totaling $16.3 million and was partially offset by an accretion adjustment recorded during the same period, based on changes in expected cash flows on a structured indemnity contract. Results from these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2007, decreased compared to the same period in 2006 due to an unfavorable accretion adjustment recorded in 2007 based on changes in expected cash flows and the accelerated earnings recorded in 2006 resulting from a commutation. Offsetting these decreases in 2007 was higher net investment income as a result of higher yields and overall larger investment asset balances. Reinsurance The following table summarizes the underwriting profit (loss) for this segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2008 % Change08 vs 07 2007 % Change07 vs 06 2006 Gross premiums written $ 2,260,477 (15.1 )% $ 2,663,494 (13.1 )% $ 3,066,138 Net premiums written 1,753,467 (16.9 )% 2,110,865 (11.5 )% 2,384,340 Net premiums earned 1,993,206 (13.4 )% 2,302,039 (10.5 )% 2,570,959 Fee income and other 9,260 NM * 1,698 (63.1 )% 4,597 Net losses and loss expenses 1,229,554 (1.2 )% 1,244,764 (14.7 )% 1,459,309 Acquisition costs 383,136 (20.5 )% 482,024 (5.7 )% 511,133 Operating expenses 189,027 (8.2 )% 205,966 8.1 % 190,545 Underwriting profit $ 200,749 (45.9 )% $ 370,983 (10.5 )% $ 414,569 Exchange (gains) (170,153 ) NM * (48,219 ) 12.4 % (42,894 ) Net results structured products 25,694 0.7 % 25,520 (29.5 )% 36,218 * NM Not meaningful Gross and net premiums written decreased by 15.1% and 16.9%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. These decreases resulted from the Company declining business due to competitive pressures continuing to drive certain rates below the Companys acceptable underwriting return levels together with increased client retentions. Partially offsetting these decreases in gross premiums written were favorable foreign exchange rate movements of $55.0 million and increases of $118.4 million associated with a U.S. agricultural program whose rates are tied to commodity prices, which have increased in 2008. Ceded premiums written decreased mainly as a result of the impact of a reduction in property catastrophe cessions to Cyrus Re II of 10% in 2008 as compared to a 35% cession to Cyrus Re throughout 2007, partially offset by ceded premiums totaling $23.3 million associated with the purchase of additional catastrophe loss protection in the form of industry loss warranty covers. However, the overall ceded ratio increased mainly due to lower net retention in 2008 as compared to 2007, mainly due to higher cession ratios associated with the U.S. agricultural program noted above, causing net premiums written to decrease at a higher percentage than gross premiums written. Gross and net premiums written decreased by 13.1% and 11.5%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006. These decreases resulted from the Company declining business due to competitive pressures continuing to drive certain rates below the 96 Companys acceptable underwriting levels as well as certain favorable reinstatement premium and U.S. property program adjustments recorded in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, premium rate decreases were most significant in certain casualty and non U.S. property lines of business. Net premiums written reflect the above changes in gross premiums written, combined with a reduction in ceded premiums in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of higher retentions and a lower cost of external retrocession. Net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased 13.4% as compared to the same period in 2007. Net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased 10.5% as compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease in both 2008 and 2007 was a reflection of the overall reduction of net premiums written over the last three years. Fee income increased by $7.6 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly as a result of fees associated with capacity utilization with certain Lloyds syndicates. The following table presents the ratios for the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: 2008 2007 2006 Loss and loss expense ratio 61.7 % 54.1 % 56.8 % Underwriting expense ratio 28.7 % 29.8 % 27.3 % Combined ratio 90.4 % 83.9 % 84.1 % The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred in the current year and any favorable or adverse prior year development of loss reserves held at the beginning of the year. The following table summarizes the net (favorable) adverse prior year development by line of business relating to the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Property and other short tail lines $ (138.4 ) $ (188.7 ) $ (133.0 ) Casualty and other (166.8 ) (87.4 ) 7.3 Structured Indemnity 8.8 28.3 Total $ (305.2 ) $ (267.3 ) $ (97.4 ) Loss and loss expense ratio excluding prior year development 77.0 % 65.7 % 60.6 % In addition, the following tables present the prior year (favorable) adverse development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves within the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: Gross: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 8,001 $ 8,193 $ 8,704 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (444 ) (260 ) (18 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 7,557 $ 7,933 $ 8,686 Net: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 7,053 $ 7,138 $ 7,112 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (305 ) (267 ) (98 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 6,748 $ 6,871 $ 7,014 Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 11.3 loss percentage points as compared to the same period in 2007 with 7.7 points attributable to an increase in catastrophe losses occurring during 2008 (12.0 points in 2008 versus 4.3 points in 2007), mainly as a result of the impacts of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, which resulted in net incurred losses in the Companys Reinsurance segment of $155.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums. The remaining increase of 3.6 loss ratio points was attributable to 97 the softening rate environment, higher attritional property losses and higher anticipated loss activity in the professional and trade credit portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net favorable prior year reserve development included casualty and other lines reserve releases in both European and U.S. casualty and professional portfolios as well as reserve releases associated with the reinsurance to close relating to the 2005 year of account on certain Lloyds sourced business. In the same period, property and other short tail lines net favorable development was attributable to most business units globally. Gross prior year favorable development for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $444.3 million exceeded the corresponding net favorable development during the same period of $305.2 million as the impact of favorable loss experience related to a large crop program was mostly offset by the impact of retrocession protection related to this program. Within the Reinsurance segment, reserve releases of $188.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily in property and other short tail lines of business and $87.4 million in casualty and other lines, was partially offset by adverse prior year development of $8.8 million within the structured indemnity line of business. Releases in the short tail lines relate primarily to the 2005 and 2006 accident years. The casualty and other lines favorable development of $87.4 million reflects the net result of releases of $121.4 million primarily in the U.S. and non U.S. casualty portfolios, partially offset by net adverse development of $13.0 million associated with the results of an external review of the Companys asbestos and environmental reserves and $21.0 million related to a commutation of a stop loss reinsurance agreement. Favorable gross prior year development of $259.7 million was in line with the net development. Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by 5.1 loss percentage points as compared to the same period in 2006 as a result of higher attritional losses within the property risk book of business as well as losses recorded relating to certain catastrophe losses including European windstorms Kyrill and Per/Hanno, California wildfires and the Peru earthquake. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the same period in 2007, was due to a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 1.7 points (19.2% compared to 20.9%) and was partially offset by an increase in the operating expense ratio of 0.6 points (9.5% compared to 8.9%). The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio was primarily due to a favorable variance in performance related commissions in 2008 as compared to 2007. Although operating expenses were lower in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007, the lower level of net premiums earned as noted above caused an increase in the operating expense ratio. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly as a result of a bad debt provision and higher performance related compensation expenses both recorded in 2007 and was partially offset by the impact in 2008 of costs associated with the Companys restructuring activities as well as administrative expenses associated with the expansion of the Companys reinsurance operations in Brazil. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2006, was due to an increase in both operating expense and acquisition expense ratios to 8.9% and 20.9%, respectively, as compared with 7.4% and 19.9%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in acquisition expenses was primarily due to a change in the mix of business as well as an adjustment related to the earning of acquisition expenses within the U.S. individual risk portfolio recorded in the first quarter of 2007. The operating expense ratio increase was due primarily to higher compensation expenses and corporate allocations, combined with a lower level of net premiums earned. Foreign exchange gains in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were due primarily to the change in the value of the U.S. dollar against certain European currencies including the U.K. Sterling and the Euro on certain inter company balances and net underwriting liability balances. Net results from structured reinsurance products include certain structured indemnity contracts that are accounted for as deposit contracts. Results from these products for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, increased slightly compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to lower interest expenses associated with a higher accretion rate recorded in 2007 on certain workers compensation coverage and were partially offset by lower net investment income. Net investment income decreased mainly as a result of lower yields earned on invested assets in 2008 as compared to 2007 combined with the impact of a lower average investment asset base. Results from these products for the year ended December 31, 2007 decreased compared to the same period in 2006 mainly as a result of a higher accretion rate recorded in 98 2007 on deposit liabilities relating to certain workers compensation coverage and partially offset by higher net investment income in 2007 as a result of an increase in the average size of investment asset balances as a result of new transactions. Life Operations In 2008, the Company announced its intention to review strategic opportunities relating to its Life reinsurance business which resulted in the Company selling the renewal rights to its life, accident and health business, a relatively small block of business, in late 2008. The Company continues to explore various strategic options for its annuity book, the mortality and critical illness book and as well for its U.S. life business.

Second quarter of 2007 one Irish immediate annuity portfolio bound, for which net premium earned totaled $94.6 million. 2. Second and fourth quarters of 2006 two Irish immediate annuity portfolios bound, for which net premium earned totaled $152.5 million. The Company acquired cash and investment assets related to the future policy benefit reserves assumed at inception of these large contracts. While the Company may write more of these contracts, the frequency of these transactions will likely continue to be irregular and their sizes will differ from transaction to transaction. Gross premiums written relating to other life business increased by $63.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to premium growth in the core underlying book of term assurance and critical illness business of $47.0 million, premium growth in U.S. business of $25.0 million and partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements of $16.0 million. In addition, gross premiums written related to short term life, accident and health business 99 increased by $7.0 million primarily as a result of favorable foreign exchange rate movements and partially by decreases in gross premiums written associated with soft market conditions experienced in 2008. Gross premiums written relating to annuity business decreased by $115.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to a single Irish immediate annuity contract totaling $94.6 million written during 2007, unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements of $19.3 million and $1.4 million lower premiums from other annuity business which decreases through time as defined by the treaties. Ceded premiums written were roughly consistent with the prior year. Gross premiums written relating to other life business increased by $98.9 million or 29.4% in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily as a result of growth in the underlying book of term assurance and critical illness business of $79.6 million, combined with favorable foreign exchange movements of $19.3 million. Gross premiums written relating to annuity business decreased by $42.6 million or 12.2% in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended 2006 mainly due to a lower level of single premium annuity portfolio business of $57.8 million, offset by favorable foreign exchange rate movements of $15.2 million. Ceded premium ratios remained roughly consistent with the prior year. Net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by 7.3% as compared to the same period in 2007. Net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2007 increased 8.4% as compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease in 2008 and the increase in 2007 were consistent with the movements in total gross and net premiums written as described above. Changes in claims and policy benefit reserves were generally consistent with movements in gross and net premiums written but also included the movement in policy benefit reserves related to other contracts (such as tranches of immediate annuity portfolios) where investment assets were acquired with the assumption of the policy benefit reserves at the inception of the contract. Claims and policy benefit reserves decreased by $119.7 million or 13.5% in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of the factors noted above affecting gross and net premiums written, combined with a loss recognition adjustment of $25.4 million recorded in 2007 relating to certain novated blocks of U.S. based term life mortality reinsurance business and partially offset by higher incurred losses of $11.5 million associated with certain short term life, accident and health business. Claims and policy benefit reserves increased by $81.4 million or 10.1% in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 mainly as a result of growth in the underlying block of term assurance and critical illness business increasing losses by $65.2 million, unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements of $52.8 million, a loss recognition adjustment of $25.4 million relating to certain novated blocks of U.S. based term life mortality reinsurance business, offset by lower losses relating to single premium immediate annuity business of $62.0 million from fewer single premium portfolio contracts bound during the year. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, acquisition costs increased by 5.9% as compared to the same period in 2007, largely as a result of the growth in regular premium business as noted above and partially offset by a favorable profit commission adjustment associated with the short term life, accident and health business and favorable foreign exchange rate impacts. Operating expenses decreased by 4.8% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to lower performance based compensation expenses and a decrease in professional fees as a result of costs recorded in 2007 related to an actuarial loss reserve review. Acquisition costs increased by 21.8% in 2007 as compared to 2006 mainly as a result of the growth in the book of regular term assurance and critical illness treaties consistent with the earned premium variance, as well as the impact of a favorable profit commission adjustment recorded in 2006 relating to a term life treaty. Operating expenses decreased by 2.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a decrease in both professional fees and corporate allocations, offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements and higher compensation costs. Net investment income is included in the calculation of contribution from Life Operations, as it relates to income earned on portfolios of separately identified and managed life investment assets and other allocated assets. Net investment income decreased by $7.2 million or 1.9% in the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of negative foreign exchange rate impacts and partially offset by higher net investment income associated with growth in the average size of the investment asset balances due to premiums associated with regular premium business. However, it 100 should be noted that as at December 31, 2008, approximately $1.1 billion of the gross unrealized losses on the Companys investments related to portfolios of Life Operations investment assets primarily as a result of increases in credit spreads during this period, primarily in the U.K. and Euro zone, and the long duration of the underlying assets. Refer to Balance Sheet Analysis below for further discussion of unrealized losses and gains on investments. Net investment income increased by $38.3 million or 10.9% in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of favorable foreign exchange rate movements of $23.9 million and increases in the average size of investment asset balances. Other Financial Lines The Other Financial Lines segment is comprised of the funding agreement business and previously, the GIC business. As at December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $4.0 billion of deposit liabilities associated with GICs which were correspondingly matched with invested assets. Based on the terms and conditions of the underlying GICs, upon the downgrade of Syncora Guarantee (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc. or XLCA), below certain ratings levels, all or portions of outstanding principal balances on such GICs would come due. Throughout 2008, several rating agencies downgraded Syncora and its subsidiaries and, as a result, the Company settled during 2008 all of the GIC liabilities. At December 31, 2008, the remaining balance of funding agreements, excluding accrued interest of $6.6 million, was $600.0 million, with settlements scheduled through to 2010. Management does not expect any significant impact on the Companys results of operations or liquidity as a result of the maturity of these contracts. At December 31, 2007, a significant component of the investments held in the Companys Other Financial Lines segment portfolios was comprised of Topical Assets and CDOs. Liquidations necessary to fund the repayment of the GIC liabilities following the downgrade of Syncora Guarantee and the maturity of certain funding agreements, were funded through sales of assets in these portfolios as well as the general investment portfolios. Managements approach was to avoid the sale of assets where current market prices did not reflect intrinsic values or where transaction costs for liquidation were excessive. As a result, the Company continues to hold a number of the Topical Assets and CDOs and these were transferred to the general investment portfolio in exchange for those assets that were liquidated. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the net results from these structured products were $18.1 million and included net investment income, interest expense and operating expenses of $100.4 million, $72.6 million, and $9.7 million, respectively, while for the year ended December 31, 2007, the net results from these structured products were $48.1 million and included net investment income, interest expense and operating expenses of $389.0 million, $326.4 million, and $14.5 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the net results from these structured products were $34.7 million and included net investment income, interest expense and operating expenses of $341.9 million, $296.9 million, and $10.4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net investment income, interest expense and operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the average deposit liability balance and the associated asset portfolios as a result of the settlement of the GIC portfolio and certain funding agreements noted above. In addition, operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in compensation expense associated with a lower headcount. While not reported within the contribution from the Other Financial Lines segment, approximately $97.1 million of the reported realized losses on investments during 2008 related to portfolios associated with GICs and funding agreements. For 2007, net investment income increased primarily as a result of an increase in yields on invested assets. Interest expense increased due to an increase in the average deposit liability balance combined with an increase in crediting rates consistent with the yield changes noted above. Operating expenses increased by $4.1 million during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to reclassification of certain contract expenses and partially offset by reduced corporate allocations.

Investment Activities The following table illustrates the change in net investment income from property and casualty operations, net income from investment fund affiliates, net realized (losses) gains on investments, and net realized and unrealized (losses) gains on investment derivative instruments for each of the three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2008 % Change08 vs 07 2007 % Change07 vs 06 2006 Net investment income property and casualty operations (1) $ 1,174,856 (8.9 )% $ 1,289,554 18.2 % $ 1,090,785 Net (loss) income from investment fund affiliates (2) (277,696 ) NM * 326,007 21.2 % 269,036 Net realized (losses) on investments (962,054 ) (59.5 )% (603,268 ) NM * (116,458 ) Net realized and unrealized (losses) gains on investment and other derivative instruments (3) (73,368 ) (32.3 )% (55,451 ) NM * 101,183 (1) Net investment income relating to property and casualty operations does not include the net investment income related to the net results from structured products.

(3) For a summary of realized and unrealized gains and losses on all derivative instruments, see Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments. * NM Not meaningful Net investment income related to property and casualty operations decreased in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 due primarily to declining portfolio yields. Portfolio yields decreased as yields earned on investment of cash flows and reinvestment of maturing or sold securities were generally lower than on securities previously held, as prevailing market interest rates, particularly in the U.S., decreased over the last year. As well, the portfolio mix changed as a result of the settlement of the GIC and funding agreements liabilities, as the property and casualty operations assumed a number of the floating rate securities previously held in the Companys Other Financial Lines segment and as a result is more sensitive to changes in short term U.S. interest rates as well as increased allocations to lower yielding government, agency and cash securities. Net investment income related to property and casualty operations increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to a higher investment base and increases in the yield of the portfolio. The increase was primarily due to the full 2007 financial year impact of the higher interest rates experienced in the U.S., U.K. and Euro zone, during the latter part of 2006 and the beginning part of 2007. Net income from investment fund affiliates includes earnings from the Companys investments in closed end investment funds and partnerships and similar vehicles that are equity accounted. The Companys net loss from investment fund affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2008 reflected negative returns in the Companys alternative portfolio. Broad based market declines, combined with extreme volatility, a sharp pull back in the availability of credit and short sale restrictions implemented by securities market regulators proved highly challenging for the strategies employed by many of the Companys alternative investment managers as the markets during 2008 were particularly challenging for strategies employed by the Companys alternative investment managers given the extreme volatility, overall pull back of credit availability, Net income from investment fund affiliates increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 due primarily to exceptional results in the alternative portfolio and as a result of a higher investment asset base Investment Performance The Company manages its investment grade fixed income securities using an asset/liability management framework. Due to the unique nature of the underlying liabilities, customized benchmarks are used to measure investment performance and comparison to standard market indices is not meaningful. 102 Investment performance is not monitored for certain assets primarily consisting of operating cash and special regulatory deposits. The following is a summary of the investment portfolio returns for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 of the asset/liability portfolio and risk asset portfolios: 2008(1) 2007(1) Asset/Liability Portfolio USD fixed income portfolio (9.2)% 1.6% Non USD fixed income portfolio (2.0)% 1.0% Risk Asset Portfolio Alternative portfolio (2). (16.3)% 17.0% Equity portfolio (44.1)% 10.1% High Yield fixed income portfolio (22.9)% 0.9% (1) Portfolio returns are calculated by dividing the sum of the net investment income or net income from investment fund affiliates, realized gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) by the average market value of each portfolio. Performance is measured in either the underlying asset currency or the functional currency. (2) Performance on the alternative portfolio reflects the twelve months ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net Realized Gains and Losses on Investments and Other than Temporary Declines in the Value of Investments The Companys investment portfolio is classified as available for sale. Realized investment gains and losses occur through the normal turnover of the Companys investment portfolio. Realized investment losses include impairment charges relating to declines in value of securities that are considered to be other than temporary. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for further information. Net realized losses on investments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 included net realized losses of approximately $1,023.6 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys fixed income, equity and other investments, including those relating to Lehman, where the Company determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments, including a charge of $400.0 million related to assets for which the Company could no longer assert its intent to hold until recovery. See below for further information. Included in net realized losses noted above are net realized gains of $98.8 million related to the foreign exchange component of inter company sales of assets. Further details are included in Results of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, management recorded a charge for OTTI of $400.0 million on assets for which it could no longer assert its intent to hold until recovery. Management believes that these securities were at risk for further mark to market declines, and potentially real economic losses, to the extent that economic conditions were to deteriorate further than present estimates and the Companys allocation to these asset classes is overweight relative to a traditional P&C portfolio. Accordingly, in conjunction with its risk reduction exercise, management is likely to pursue targeted sales of these assets over the course of 2009, and expects to realize the associated losses on these securities. The assets are concentrated in certain holdings within the Companys BBB and lower corporate, CMBS, equity and consumer ABS portfolios. In 2007, net realized losses on investments were $603.3 million which included $1,012.8 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $46.9 million of gross realized losses on equity securities. Gross realized losses in 2007 included $611.0 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary. As a percentage of the total fixed income portfolio, the write down for other than temporary declines was 1.5% in 2007 as compared to 0.3% in 2006. In 2006, net realized losses on investments were $116.5 million which includes $390.4 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $88.5 million of gross realized losses on equity securities. Gross realized losses in 2006 included $151.4 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary. With respect to those securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2008, the following is an analysis of the period of time that those securities had been in a continual unrealized loss position, the amount of the realized loss recorded in the Companys results of operations as of the sale date and the amount of the impairment charge taken in the year: 103 Length of time in a continual unrealized loss position(U.S. dollars in thousands) Fixed IncomeSecurities EquitySecurities Less than 6 months $ 178,194 $ 74,619 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 44,626 30,547 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 53,852 9,549 At least 2 years 68,367 404 Total gross realized loss from sales 345,039 115,119 Impairment charges for declines in value considered to be other than temporary 912,228 109,928 Total gross realized loss $ 1,257,267 $ 225,047 With respect to those securities that were sold at a loss during the year ended December 31, 2007, the following is an analysis of the period of time that those securities had been in a continual unrealized loss position, the amount of the realized loss recorded in the Companys results of operations as of the sale date and the amount of the impairment charge taken in the year: Length of time in a continual unrealized loss position(U.S. dollars in thousands) Fixed IncomeSecurities EquitySecurities Less than 6 months $ 111,174 $ 32,023 At least 6 months but less than 12 months. 202,682 8,294 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 42,234 3,887 At least 2 years 48,393 126 Total gross realized loss from sales 404,483 44,330 Impairment charges for declines in value considered to be other than temporary 608,322 2,600 Total gross realized loss $ 1,012,805 $ 46,930 The Companys process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors, as discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company realized losses of $122.2 million and $10.0 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equity securities, respectively, that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company realized losses of $90.6 million and $4.0 million upon the sale of fixed income securities and equity securities, respectively, that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months. The decisions to sell these securities were made by the Companys investment managers based upon a change in market conditions and other factors (these decisions were independent of the Companys previously stated intent and ability to hold such securities). Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on Derivatives Net realized and unrealized losses on investment derivatives for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted from the Companys investment strategy to manage interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk, and to replicate permitted investments. Included in these amounts are gains associated with purchased credit default swaps offset by losses related to interest rate swap positions. Net realized and unrealized losses on investment and other derivatives for the same period in 2007 resulted primarily from a mark to market loss of $37.0 million with respect to a total return swap on the capital notes of a structured investment vehicle impacted by the markdown in the underlying net asset value of the assets of the capital notes, combined with mark to market losses associated with the Companys capital, investment and hedging activities.

Net losses from financial operating affiliates in 2007 include the results and related write downs associated with Syncora and Primus as well as the impact of losses recorded on previous reinsurance transactions with Syncora of approximately $351.0 million. For further details relating to Syncora and the closing of the Master Agreement, see Results of Operations above as well as Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Syncora Holdings Ltd. (Syncora). Investment manager affiliate income decreased by $83.8 million or 88.5% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of recent volatility in both the credit and equity markets, impacting investment manager affiliates specializing in global equities and fixed income securities most significantly. Investment manager affiliate income increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 mainly due to strong results generated from certain global equity and mortgage specialist investment manager affiliates, partially offset by the write off of the Companys investment in a manager that managed a series of structured investment vehicles and conduits. Net income from other strategic operating affiliates decreased in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to lower earnings reported in 2008 from both an insurance affiliate which writes largely direct U.S. homeowners insurance and the Companys Brazilian joint venture ITA&Uacute; XL. Offsetting these decreases was earnings from an investment in an affiliate entered into in the second quarter of 2008 that provides reinsurance to certain Lloyds syndicates. Net income from other strategic operating affiliates increased in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily as a result of strong 105 results from the same insurance affiliate noted above which writes largely U.S. homeowners insurance and the Companys Brazilian joint venture ITA&Uacute; XL. Due to the financial market and economic events that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test for goodwill subsequent to its annual testing date of June 30. The interim impairment test resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $990.0 million. For further information, see Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and see further discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Amortization of intangible assets increased in 2008 as a result of the increase in intangible assets related to the XL GAPS acquisition in 2007. Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2007 as a result of certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during 2006. Corporate operating expenses in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 increased compared to the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of increases in professional fees associated with the execution of the Master Agreement described above as well as costs recorded in 2008 relating to the Companys expense reduction initiative, including employee termination benefits as well as costs associated with ceasing to use certain leased property accounted for as operating leases. For further information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. Offsetting these increases were lower compensation expenses as a result of performance based accruals recorded in 2007. Corporate operating expenses decreased by 30.2% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily as a result of certain compensation costs being allocated to the operating segments in 2007. Interest expense from property and casualty operations includes costs related to the Companys debt and collateral facilities as well as certain deposit liability accretion. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 was lower primarily due to costs associated with the retirement of the 2009 Senior Notes recorded in 2007, lower interest expense as a result of the early redemption, in August 2008, of X.L. America, Inc.s 6.58% Notes and was partially offset by interest expense associated with the 10.75% Equity Security Units (the 10.75% Units) issued in August 2008. Interest expense was higher in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes in early May 2007 as well as the costs associated with the retirement of the 2009 Senior Notes. For more information on the Companys financial structure, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. In connection with the early redemption of the 6.58% Notes as noted above, the Company recorded debt extinguishment costs of approximately $22.5 million in 2008. The decrease in the Companys income taxes in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily a result of a change in the geographical locations of the profits earned primarily by the Companys U.S. and European operations, including the impact of losses associated with the Master Agreement and goodwill impairment charges related to operating entities in jurisdictions not subject to income tax. The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 differed as compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to significant charges for which no tax benefit accrued and which resulted in a loss before tax. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased as compared to the same period in 2006, principally from an improvement in the profitability of the Companys U.S. and European property and casualty operations in those respective years. The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased from that in 2006 due primarily to non deductible asset impairment charges recorded in Bermuda, the U.S. and the U.K. The deferral of tax losses is evaluated based upon the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities and, under current projections, the Company anticipates using this asset. The Companys net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2008 was $331.3 million, which consisted primarily of net operating losses generated by subsidiaries in the U.K. Should the taxable income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance may have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax effected. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxation. Minority interest expense in 2007 related primarily to the 37% ownership interest in Syncora common shares held by the public prior to the secondary offering of Syncora common shares on June 6, 2007, while minority interest expense in 2006 related primarily to the 37% ownership interest in Syncora following the 106 initial public offering in August 2006 as well as the minority interest ownership in preferred shares of Syncora Guarantee Re. Balance Sheet Analysis Investments The primary objectives of the investment strategy are to support the liabilities arising from the operations of the Company, generate stable investment income and to build book value for the Company over the longer term. The strategy strives to balance investment returns against market and credit risks taken. The Companys overall investment portfolio is structured to take into account a number of variables including local regulatory requirements, business needs, collateral management and risk tolerance. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, total investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased) were $34.3 billion and $43.7 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes the composition of the Companys invested assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Fair Value2008 Percent ofTotal Fair Value2007 Percent ofTotal Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,353,826 12.7 % $ 3,880,030 8.9 % Net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased) 99,455 0.3 % (191,472 ) (0.4 )% Accrued investment income 363,376 1.1 % 447,660 1.0 % Short term investments 1,466,323 4.3 % 1,803,198 4.1 % Fixed maturities: U.S. Government and Government agency $ 3,978,342 11.6 % $ 2,685,773 6.1 % Corporate 9,288,603 27.1 % 12,987,248 29.7 % Mortgage and asset backed securities 8,526,256 24.9 % 14,493,877 33.1 % U.S. States and political subdivisions of the States 468,770 1.4 % 253,534 0.6 % Non U.S. Sovereign Government 3,374,397 9.8 % 3,187,358 7.3 % Total fixed maturities $ 25,636,368 74.8 % $ 33,607,790 76.8 % Equity securities 361,819 1.0 % 854,815 2.0 % Investments in affiliates 1,552,789 4.5 % 2,611,149 6.0 % Other investments 459,481 1.3 % 708,476 1.6 % Total investments and cash and cash equivalents $ 34,293,437 100.0 % $ 43,721,646 100.0 % The Company reviews on a regular basis its issuer concentration, credit quality and compliance with established guidelines. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the average credit quality of the Companys total fixed income portfolio (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) was AA. At December 31, 2008 approximately 53.9% of the fixed income portfolio (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased)) was rated AAA by one or more of the principal ratings agencies. Approximately 2.5% of the fixed income portfolio was below investment grade or not rated. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, total investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased) were $34.3 billion and $43.7 billion, respectively. This decrease of $9.4 billion was primarily due to the settlement of the Companys GIC liabilities in 2008, the mark to market effect as a result of the challenging credit markets, depreciation of the Sterling assets as measured in U.S. dollars, the payment of $1.8 billion to Syncora under the Master Agreement and was partially offset by cash flow from the Companys financing activities in August 2008. The annualized effective yield of the total investment portfolio (excluding non recurring items) was 4.8% for 2008 as compared to 5.2% for 2007, a 0.4% decrease. The decrease in the effective yield of the total investment portfolio was primarily due to declines in U.S. interest rates and the resulting impact on the Companys floating rate assets, as well as increased allocations to lower yielding government, agency and cash securities. 107 Refer to Results of Operations for further discussion surrounding the impact of credit market movements on the Companys investment portfolio and exposure to sub prime related assets. Net Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments At December 31, 2008, the Company had net unrealized losses on fixed maturities and short term investments of $3,388.6 million and net unrealized gains on equity securities of $24.1 million. Of these amounts, gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and short term investments and equities were $4,122.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, the Company had net (pre tax) unrealized losses on fixed maturities and short term investments of $637.3 million and net unrealized gains on equity securities of $190.6 million. Of these amounts, gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and short term investments and equities were $1,069.5 million and $14.9 million, respectively. The impact of the deteriorating corporate and structured credit spreads during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, was the primary reason for the decline in the net unrealized position on fixed maturities and short term investments, offset by the impact of declining government rates in the U.S.and the U.K. The information shown below about the unrealized losses on the Companys investments at December 31, 2008 and 2007 concerns the potential effect upon future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of these investments are other than temporary. The following is an analysis of how long each of those investment securities with an unrealized loss at December 31, 2008 and 2007 had been in a continual unrealized loss position: Type of Securities(U.S. dollars in thousands) Length of time in a continualunrealized loss position Amount ofunrealized loss atDecember 31, 2008 Amount ofunrealized loss atDecember 31, 2007 Fixed Maturities and Short Term Investments Less than six months $ 798,866 $ 145,992 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 664,593 575,913 At least 12 months but less than 2 years 1,955,760 309,148 2 years or more 703,104 38,446 Total $ 4,122,323 $ 1,069,499 Equities Less than six months $ 5,584 $ 10,400 At least 6 months but less than 12 months 1,994 4,496 Total $ 7,578 $ 14,896 At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the following table sets forth the maturity profile of the fixed income securities that were in a gross unrealized loss position: Maturity profile in years of fixed maturitysecurities in a gross unrealized loss position(U.S. dollars in thousands) Amount ofunrealized loss atDecember 31, 2008 Amount ofunrealized loss atDecember 31, 2007 Less than 1 year remaining $ 38,702 $ 23,695 At least 1 year but less than 5 years remaining 622,011 103,081 At least 5 years but less than 10 years remaining 438,837 150,786 More than 10 years but less than 20 years remaining 205,371 60,471 At least 20 years or more remaining 843,274 233,689 Mortgage and asset backed securities 1,974,128 497,777 Total $ 4,122,323 $ 1,069,499 At December 31, 2008, the total gross unrealized losses represented approximately 7,800 fixed income securities out of a total of approximately 14,100 fixed income securities (representing fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) and approximately 30 equity securities out of a total of approximately 1,475. At December 31, 2007, the total gross unrealized losses represented approximately 7,600 fixed income securities out of a total of approximately 17,100 fixed income securities (representing fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) and approximately 300 equity securities out of a total of approximately 1,000. 108 Of the gross unrealized investment losses on the fixed income and short term investments portfolio at December 31, 2008 of $4.1 billion, approximately $2.0 billion related to corporate fixed income securities. Within the corporate fixed income securities, approximately 48.5% of the losses were in the financial sector and 20.1% in the diversified sector. No other sector was greater than 5%. The largest unrealized loss in the fixed income portfolio was $29.4 million. No equity securities held by the Company at December 31, 2008 were in a continual unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer. The largest individual unrealized loss in the equity portfolio was $6.8 million. Of the gross unrealized investment losses on the fixed income and short term investments portfolio at December 31, 2007 of $1.1 billion, approximately $546.1 million related to corporate fixed income securities. Within the corporate fixed income securities, approximately 68.0% of the losses were in the financial sector and 12.3% in the diversified sector. No other sector was greater than 5%. The largest unrealized loss in the fixed income portfolio was $7.9 million. No equity securities held by the Company at December 31, 2007 were in a continual unrealized loss position for 12 months. The largest individual unrealized loss in the equity portfolio was $1.0 million. Factors considered in determining that additional OTTI charges were not warranted include managements consideration of current and near term liquidity needs and other available sources, an evaluation of the factors and time necessary for recovery, and the results of on going retrospective reviews of security sales and the basis for such sales. Gross unrealized losses of $4.1 billion at December 31, 2008 can be attributed to the following significant drivers: gross unrealized losses of $1.0 billion related to the Companys Life Operations investment portfolio, which had a fair value of $5.6 billion as at December 31, 2008. Of this, $673.4 million of gross unrealized losses related to $1.7 billion of exposures to corporate financial institutions including Tier One and Upper Tier Two securities. At December 31, 2008, this portfolio had average interest rate duration of 8.9 years, primarily denominated in U.K. Sterling and Euros. As a result of the long duration, significant gross losses have arisen as the fair values of these securities are more sensitive to prevailing government interest rates and credit spreads. This portfolio has limited turnover as it is matched to corresponding long duration liabilities. A hypothetical parallel increase in interest rates and credit spreads of 50 and 25 basis points, respectively, would increase the unrealized losses related to this portfolio at December 31, 2008 by approximately $236.9 million and $82.2 million, respectively. Given the long term nature of this portfolio, and the level of credit spreads as at December 31, 2008 relative to historical averages within the U.K. and Euro zone as well as the Companys liquidity needs at December 31, 2008, the Company believes that these assets will continue to be held until such time as they mature, or credit spreads revert to levels more consistent with historical averages. The Company continues to explore strategic alternatives with respect to its Life Operations segment. The conclusion of such consideration could impact the amount and timing of any impairment related to this portfolio. gross unrealized losses of $1.1 billion related to the corporate holdings within the Companys non life fixed maturity portfolios, which had a fair value of $6.9 billion as at December 31, 2008. The Company believes these impairments are a function of the currently elevated levels of corporate credit spreads in the U.S. and globally, which spiked particularly during the third and fourth quarters of 2008, resulting in a severely depressed level of valuations. The amount of these gross losses has proven very volatile as a result of the severe deterioration in credit spreads in recent months. For example, the gross unrealized losses increased by approximately $458.3 million or 6.7% of amortized cost during the third and fourth quarters of 2008, a period in which U.S. corporate credit spreads increased by approximately 300 basis points from what were already elevated levels, excluding the impact of foreign currency movements and offset by the impact of interest rate declines. The Company believes that the gross unrealized losses are a reflection of a severe premium being charged by the market for credit, rather than fundamental deterioration in the debt service capabilities of the issuers. 109 gross unrealized losses of $602.9 million related to the Topical Asset portfolio (which consists of the Companys holdings of sub prime non agency securities, second liens, ABS CDOs with sub prime collateral as well as Alt A mortgage exposures), which had a fair value of $963.3 million as at December 31, 2008. The Company undertook a security level review of these securities and recognized charges to the extent it believed the intrinsic value of any security was below its amortized cost. The Company has recognized realized losses, consisting of charges for OTTI and realized losses from sales, of approximately $660.8 million since the beginning of 2007 and through December 31, 2008 on these asset classes. The Company purchased a number of these assets to support the previously written GIC and funding agreement contracts and has announced its intention to reduce its exposure to this asset class as part of its strategic portfolio realignment. The Company believes that based on market conditions and liquidity needs at December 31, 2008, this reduction will be realized through natural cash flows of the portfolio, and limited selective sales, rather than selling these assets into markets which continue to be illiquid and not reflective of the intrinsic value of these assets. The weighted average term to maturity of the sub prime and Alt A residential holdings within this portfolio at December 31, 2008 were 3.6 years and 3.5 years, respectively. The Company, based on current market conditions and liquidity needs as well as its assessment of the holdings, believes it will continue to hold these securities until either maturity, or a return of liquidity and valuations more reflective of the intrinsic value of these holdings. gross unrealized losses of $469.9 million related to the non life portfolio of Core CDO holdings (defined by the Company as investments in non mortgage collateralized debt obligations), which consisted primarily of collateralized loan obligations and had a fair value of $665.5 million as of December 31, 2008. The Company undertook a security level review of these securities and recognized charges to the extent it believed the intrinsic value of the security was below the amortized cost. The Company believes that the level of impairment is primarily a function of historically wide spreads in the collateralized loan obligations market during the period, driven by the high level of illiquidity in this market. The Company purchased a number of these assets to support the previously written GIC and Funding Agreement contracts and has announced its intention to reduce its exposure to this asset class over time as a part of its strategic portfolio realignment. The Company, based on current market conditions and liquidity needs as well as its assessment of the holdings, believes it is likely that the Company will continue to hold these securities until either maturity or a recovery of value, following which the Company intends to reduce its exposure to this asset class. gross unrealized losses of $346.5 million related to the non life portion of CMBS holdings, which had a fair value of $2.1 billion as at December 31, 2008. The Companys holdings in CMBS are 97.5% rated AAA. The Companys exposure to downgrades has been negligible, and it believes that the currently depressed pricing, which represents approximately 79.8% of the par value of the securities, is directly related to the 753 basis point widening in credit spreads within this market, as a result of the heightened risk premium attached to property collateral. Our portfolio is highly diversified, has limited delinquencies and has experienced limited downgrades. 110 The following table summarizes the fair value, gross unrealized losses, credit rating and asset class of securities in a gross unrealized loss position within the Companys structured credit and corporate portfolios, which comprised $4.3 billion of the Companys total gross unrealized loss position of $4.1 billion at December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in millions) Corporates AAA AA A BBB BB & Below Total Financials (1) Fair value $ 435.2 $ 1,014.2 $ 2,079.8 $ 222.1 $ 36.5 $ 3,787.8 Gross unrealized loss $ (25.4 ) $ (149.0 ) $ (660.5 ) $ (159.8 ) $ (44.0 ) $ (1,038.7 ) Non Financials Fair value $ 184.9 $ 302.4 $ 1,407.9 $ 1,211.2 $ 463.0 $ 3,569.4 Gross unrealized loss $ (25.5 ) $ (35.8 ) $ (335.3 ) $ (311.4 ) $ (230.1 ) $ (938.1 ) Total Fair value $ 620.1 $ 1,316.6 $ 3,487.7 $ 1,433.3 $ 499.5 $ 7,357.2 Gross unrealized loss $ (50.9 ) $ (184.8 ) $ (995.8 ) $ (471.2 ) $ (274.1 ) $ (1,976.8 ) % Impaired (of amortized cost)(3) (7.8 )% (12.5 )% (22.6 )% (25.1 )% (35.9 )% (21.6 )% Structured Credit AAA AA A BBB BB & Below Total CMBS Fair value $ 1,426.8 $ 7.9 $ 6.7 $ 9.5 $ 8.8 $ 1,459.7 Gross unrealized loss $ (331.9 ) $ (5.1 ) $ (4.9 ) $ (7.7 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (362.0 ) Prime RMBS Fair value $ 645.9 $ 125.5 $ 56.6 $ 8.0 $ 24.8 $ 860.8 Gross unrealized loss $ (222.7 ) $ (67.7 ) $ (45.7 ) $ (5.9 ) $ (13.9 ) $ (355.9 ) Topical Assets Fair value $ 534.0 $ 175.8 $ 87.0 $ 28.4 $ 53.5 $ 878.7 Gross unrealized loss $ (312.6 ) $ (157.5 ) $ (63.7 ) $ (29.9 ) $ (39.3 ) $ (603.0 ) Core CDOs (2) Fair value $ 166.7 $ 324.6 $ 51.7 $ 109.2 $ 10.2 $ 662.4 Gross unrealized loss $ (61.7 ) $ (173.9 ) $ (46.6 ) $ (163.7 ) $ (24.4 ) $ (470.3 ) Other Asset & Mortgage Backed Securities Fair value $ 790.0 $ 97.9 $ 220.8 $ 60.4 $ 27.8 $ 1,196.9 Gross unrealized loss $ (58.2 ) $ (18.4 ) $ (74.1 ) $ (28.9 ) $ (2.3 ) $ (181.9 ) Total Fair Value $ 3,563.4 $ 731.7 $ 422.8 $ 215.5 $ 125.1 $ 5,058.5 Gross unrealized loss $ (987.1 ) $ (422.6 ) $ (235.0 ) $ (236.1 ) $ (92.3 ) $ (1,973.1 ) % Impaired (of amortized cost)(3) (21.8 )% (36.8 )% (35.9 )% (52.7 )% (42.8 )% (28.2 )% (1) Included in the gross unrealized losses on corporate financials are gross unrealized losses of $637.1 million on Tier One and Tier Two securities of financials institutions (Hybrids), as well as $159.2 million of subordinated debt. (2) The Company defines Core CDOs as investments in non mortgage collateralized debt obligations, primarily consisting of collateralized loan obligations. (3) Management considers these impairments to be temporary. Management, in its assessment of whether securities in a gross unrealized loss position are temporarily impaired, considers the significance of the impairments. The Company had securities with gross unrealized losses of $1,174.6 million, with a fair value of $724.8 million, which as at December 31, 2008 were impaired by greater than 50% of amortized costs. The Company has evaluated each of these securities and believes it is probable that the issuer will be able to satisfy all principal and interest payments, and believes that the current levels of impairments are a function of the currently extremely elevated levels of credit spreads. Structured credit securities with gross unrealized losses representing greater than 50% of amortized cost represent $680.1 million of gross unrealized losses, with a fair value of $384.1 million. Of these gross unrealized losses, $621.6 million are rated investment grade. The Company has evaluated each of these holdings on a security by security basis in conjunction with its investments managers and utilizing 111 additional corroborative modeling techniques, and believes these securities will satisfy all principal and interest payments. These securities include $305.4 million of Topical investments, $265.9 million of Core CDOs, $69.6 million of prime RMBS and $25.6 million of CMBS holdings. Corporate securities with gross unrealized losses representing greater than 50% of amortized cost represent $494.5 million of gross unrealized losses, with a far value of $340.8 million. Of these gross unrealized losses, $394.1 million are rated investment grade. Gross unrealized losses of $238.3 million are related to holdings of financial issuers, with the majority ($190.6 million) representing hybrid instruments. The Company believes these are high grade issuers which will continue to service their principal and interest obligations. Gross losses of $186.9 million are related to diversified notes for which the Company has evaluated the underlying collateral and believes the notes will fully perform. As noted in Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies, the determination of the amount of OTTI varies by investment type and is based upon managements periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects additional impairments in net income as determinations are made. Managements determination of the amount of the impairment taken on investments is highly subjective and could adversely impact the Companys results of operations. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of OTTI taken and reflected in the Companys financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. Levels of write down or OTTI are also impacted by the Companys assessment of the intent and ability to hold securities which have declined in value until recovery. If, due to changes in circumstances, the Company determines to reposition or realign portions of the portfolio where the Company determines not to hold certain securities in an unrealized loss position to recovery, then the Company will incur OTTI charges, which charges could be significant. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Unpaid losses and loss expenses reserves relate primarily to the casualty insurance and reinsurance business written by the Company. The balance was $21.7 billion at December 31, 2008, which is a decrease of $1.5 billion from December 31, 2007. The decrease was due primarily to favorable prior year reserve development reducing losses and loss expenses incurred during 2008 and the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, paid losses in 2008 included loss reserves associated with previous reinsurance agreements with Syncora that were settled as part of the Master Agreement. The table below represents a reconciliation of the Companys unpaid losses and loss expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Gross unpaidlosses and lossexpenses Unpaidlosses andloss expensesrecoverable Netunpaid lossesand lossexpenses Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 23,207,694 $ (4,665,615 ) $ 18,542,079 Losses and loss expenses incurred 4,695,258 (732,360 ) 3,962,898 Losses and loss expenses paid/recovered (1) (5,559,039 ) 1,366,542 (4,192,497 ) Incurred case losses and unwind of discount on reserves associated with reinsurance agreements with Syncora 50,663 50,663 Foreign exchange and other (744,261 ) 66,597 (677,664 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 21,650,315 $ (3,964,836 ) $ 17,685,479 (1) Includes paid losses relating to loss reserves associated with previous reinsurance agreements with Syncora that were settled as part of the Master Agreement. 112 While the Company reviews the adequacy of established reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses regularly, no assurance can be given that actual claims made and payments related thereto will not be in excess of the amounts reserved. In the future, if such reserves develop adversely, such deficiency would have a negative impact on future results of operations. See Item 1, Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses, Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Losses and Loss Expenses, for further discussion. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit the Companys losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its ultimate liability to the Companys insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on the balance sheet represent the Companys total unpaid gross losses. Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverable relates to estimated reinsurance recoveries on the unpaid loss and loss expense reserves. Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverables were $4.0 billion and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, reinsurance balances receivable were $0.6 and $0.8 billion, respectively. The table below presents the Companys net reinsurance recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2008 and 2007: (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2008 December 31,2007 Reinsurance balances receivable $ 636,284 $ 872,465 Reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits 32,886 31,856 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 4,079,860 4,804,209 Bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (187,614 ) (193,128 ) Net paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable $ 4,561,416 $ 5,515,402 The Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due. Of the $4.6 billion total unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2008, no individual reinsurer accounted for 15% or more of the total. The Company is the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2008, collateralizing reinsurance recoverables with respect to certain reinsurers. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies. As at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had a reserve for potential non recoveries from reinsurers of $187.6 million and $193.1 million, respectively. Approximately 85% of the total unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (excluding collateral held) outstanding at December 31, 2008, were due from reinsurers rated A or better by S&P. The following is an analysis of the total recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2008, by reinsurers owing more than 3% of such total: Name of reinsurer S&Ps rating % of total Munich Reinsurance Company AA /Stable 13.3% Swiss Reinsurance Company (1) AA /Watch Neg. 9.4% Lloyds Syndicates A+/Stable 6.2% Transatlantic Reinsurance Company A+/Stable 3.7% Swiss Re Frankona Rueckversicherungs AG (1) AA /Watch Neg. 3.3% (1) In February 2009, the Swiss Reinsurance Company entities were downgraded by S&P to A+ (Stable). 113 The following table sets forth the ratings profile of the reinsurers that support the unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable net of security noted above: Standard andPoors rating % of total AAA 8.0 % AA 44.9 % A 31.6 % BBB 0.9 % BB and below 0.1 % Captives 11.1 % Not Rated 0.4 % Other 3.0 % Total 100 % Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities As disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Fair Value Measurements, effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FAS 157 and has accordingly provided required disclosures by level within the fair value hierarchy of the Companys assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value. As defined in the hierarchy, those assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3 have valuations determined using unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs and may include the entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions, applied to a modeled valuation, however, this is not the case with respect to the Companys Level 3 assets and liabilities. The vast majority of the assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 are made up of those securities for which the values were obtained from brokers where either significant inputs were utilized in determining the value that were difficult to corroborate with observable market data, or sufficient information regarding the specific inputs utilized by the broker was not obtained to support a Level 2 classification or the Company utilized internal valuation models. At December 31, 2008, a significant component of Level 3 assets represented either Core CDOs, totaling $614.9 million, or securities within the Companys portfolio of Topical Assets, totaling $49.8 million. Certain asset classes, primarily consisting of privately placed investments, did not have sufficient market corroborated information available to allow a pricing service to provide a price and accordingly the valuation was determined by the use of broker quotes. In addition, in certain instances given the market dislocation, the Company had elected to utilize Level 3 broker valuations over available pricing service valuations during the fourth quarter of 2008; however, during the latter part of 2008, fixed maturity investments were recorded based upon pricing service valuations where available resulting in transfers being recorded from Level 3 to Level 2. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments as is currently the case for certain U.S. CMOs, ABSs, CMBSs, certain collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and other Topical Assets which include certain securities with underlying sub prime and related residential mortgage exposures (such as sub prime first liens and Alt A asset backed securities) for which sufficient information, such as cash flows or other security structure or market information, was not available to enable a third party pricing service to provide a price and as such valuation is determined based on broker quotes for which sufficient information regarding the specific inputs utilized by the broker in determining the fair value was not obtained to support a Level 2 classification. In addition, as noted below, for certain CDO holdings, the Company, in the latter part of 2008, determined that internal models would be more appropriate and better representative of the fair value of these securities given that current valuations were as a result of broker bids or valuation models that used recent market trading which the Company considered to be stressed transactions. While the remainder of the Companys holdings in securities exposed to sub prime mortgages are generally not based on quoted prices for identical securities, they are based on model derived valuations from pricing services in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are considered to be observable in active markets, and these securities continue to be classified within Level 2. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company determined that for certain of its CDO holdings with a fair value of $483.2 million and a par value of $801.5 million, valuations were as a result of broker bids that used recent market trading which the Company considered to be stressed transactions. The markets for 114 CDOs have become extremely illiquid due to a number of factors including risk aversion and reduction among institutional buyers. As a result, the Company believes that current broker bids reflect loss expectations that do not reflect fair values at which willing buyers and sellers would transact. The Company determined that internal models would be more appropriate and better representative of the fair value these securities would be sold at in an orderly market. Although similar conditions exist in other portions of the Companys holdings, primarily RMBS, the Company believes that there was only sufficient and robust historical data covering previously stressed market conditions in its CLO portfolio. The Companys internal models resulted in a fair value that was $211.7 million higher than those that would have been determined by its previous methodology of utilizing third party values sourced through brokers or pricing services. This variance represents 26.4% of par value of these holdings, which based on the portfolios spread duration of 4.7 years corresponds to a 560 basis point decrease relative to the spread levels implied in current market levels of trading which management believes are distressed trades. The Company believes that, in the aggregate, this is appropriate as compared to current estimates of market credit spreads. The Companys approach for determining its CLO portfolio fair value was to apply a 60% weighting to three scenarios that the Company considered as extreme, and 40% weighting to a scenario that the Company viewed as likely. This resulted in a valuation that was based primarily on extreme loss outcomes, which the Company does not believe are likely, but recognizes as a possibility that an orderly market would price into its credit assessments given the level of uncertainty currently in the market. The individual components can be summarized as follows: 60% extreme loss outcomes: 20% weighting to current third party valuations, with a fair value of $271.5 million, which the Company believes includes the current market liquidity premium; 20% weighting to current cash flow estimates discounted at managements view of current market spreads, with a fair value of $316.8 million, which the Company believes includes the current market liquidity premium; 20% weighting to current cash flow estimates, adjusted to double the current underlying loss estimates, discounted at the coupon of the securities, with a further reduction in value representing a liquidity premium equal to double the prevailing total credit spread levels of the most severe previous CLO market deterioration, which resulted in a fair value of $410.1 million; and 40% weighting to likely loss outcomes, representing current cash flow estimates discounted at the coupon of the securities, with a further reduction in value representing a liquidity premium equal to the prevailing credit spread levels of the most severe previous CLO market deterioration, which resulted in a fair value of $702.0 million. While a number of the Level 3 investments have been written down as a result of the Companys impairment analysis, the Company continues to report, at December 31, 2008, gross unrealized losses of $535.0 million related to Level 3 available for sale investments. Management completed a detailed review; in conjunction with its external investment managers and third party advisors, of the Companys underlying sub prime and related residential mortgage exposures, as well as a consideration of the broader structured credit market, and concluded that the unrealized gains and losses in these asset classes are the result of a decrease in value due to technical spreads widening and broader market sentiment, rather than fundamental collateral deterioration and are temporary in nature. The remainder of the Level 3 assets relate to private equity investments where the nature of the underlying assets held by the investee include positions such as private business ventures and are such that significant Level 3 inputs are utilized in the valuation, and certain derivative positions. Controls over Valuation of Financial Instruments The Company performs quarterly reviews of the prices received from its third party valuation sources to assess if the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. This process is completed by investment and accounting personnel who are independent of those responsible for providing the valuations. The approaches taken to gain comfort include, but are not limited to, valuation comparisons between 115 external sources and completing recurring reviews of third party pricing services methodologies. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data, the price received from one third party may be substituted for another, or in limited circumstances management may determine that an adjustment is required to a third party value. In addition, similar valuation controls are followed by external parties responsible for sourcing appropriate valuations from third parties on the Companys behalf which provides additional comfort over the reasonableness of the fair values recorded in the Companys financial statements. Valuation Methodology of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Refer to Notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies and Fair Value Measurements for a description of the valuation methodology utilized to value Level 3 assets and liabilities, how the valuation methodology is validated as well as further details associated with various assets classified as Level 3. As at December 31, 2008, the Company did not have any liabilities that were carried at fair value based on Level 3 inputs other than derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2008. Fair Value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities At December 31, 2008, the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities as a percentage of the Companys total assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows: (U.S. dollars in thousands)(Unaudited) Total Assets andLiabilities Carriedat Fair Value atDecember 31, 2008 Fair Value ofLevel 3 Assetsand Liabilities Level 3 Assetsand Liabilities asa Percentage ofTotal Assets andLiabilitiesCarried at FairValue, by class Assets Fixed maturities, at fair value $ 25,636,368 $ 951,879 3.7 % Equity securities, at fair value 361,819 0.0 % Short term investments, at fair value 1,466,323 20,746 1.4 % Total investments available for sale $ 27,464,510 $ 972,625 3.5 % Cash equivalents (1) 2,310,274 0.0 % Other investments (2) 364,679 65,354 17.9 % Other assets (3) 122,956 314,906 256.1 % Total assets carried at fair value $ 30,262,419 $ 1,352,885 4.5 % Liabilities Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (4) $ 26,536 $ 0.0 % Other liabilities (5) 75,957 88,088 116.0 % Total liabilities carried at fair value $ 102,493 $ 88,088 85.9 % (1) Cash equivalents balances subject to fair value measurements include certificates of deposit and money market funds. (2) The other investments balance excludes certain unrated tranches of collateralized loan obligations which are carried under the cost recovery method given the uncertainty of future cash flows, as well as certain investments in project finance transactions which are carried at amortized cost. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. (3) Other assets include derivative instruments, reported on a gross basis. (4) Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased are included within Net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased) on the balance sheet. (5) Other liabilities include derivative instruments, reported on a gross basis. As at December 31, 2008, the balance of Level 3 assets as a percentage of the Companys total assets that were carried at fair value was 4.5%. The comparable percentage at December 31, 2007 was 3.7%. The increase was primarily as a result of a change in the mix of assets during 2008 due to the sale of investments associated with the settlement of the entire GIC portfolio and certain funding agreements during 2008. Partially offsetting the increase was decreases as a result of the Company, during the latter part of 2008, recording the fair value of fixed maturity investments based upon pricing service valuations where 116 available, resulting in transfers being recorded from Level 3 to Level 2. For further discussion of the Companys liquidity and available capital resources see Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. Changes in the Fair Value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Fair Value Measurements, for an analysis of the change in fair value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is a measure of the Companys ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of the Companys business operations. As an insurance company, one of the Companys principal responsibilities to its clients is to ensure that the Company has ready access to funds to settle large unforeseen claims. The Company would generally expect that positive cash flow from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most future loss scenarios. However, there is a possibility that unforeseen demands could be placed on the Company due to unforeseen events and as such the Companys liquidity needs may change. Such events include, among other things, several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time resulting in material incurred losses; rating agency downgrades of the Companys core insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries which would require posting of collateral, return of unearned premium and or the settlement of derivative transactions; large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables), etc. Any one of or a combination of such events may cause a liquidity strain for the Company. In addition, a liquidity strain could also occur in an illiquid market, such as that which was experienced in 2008 and which has continued into 2009. Investments that may be used to meet liquidity needs in the event of a liquidity strain may not be liquid, given inactive markets, or may have to be sold at a significant loss as a result of depressed prices. Because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the consolidated group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. As a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. If such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, XL Capital Ltd may be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. A downgrade below A of the Companys principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by either S&P or A.M. Best, which is two notches below the current S&P financial strength rating of A (Negative) and the A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Stable) of these subsidiaries, may trigger cancellation provisions in a significant amount of the Companys assumed reinsurance agreements and may potentially require the Company to return unearned premiums to cedants. In addition, due to collateral posting requirements under the Companys letter of credit and revolving credit facilities, such a downgrade may require the posting of cash collateral in support of certain in use portions of these facilities. Specifically, a downgrade below A by A.M. Best would trigger such collateral requirements for the Companys two largest credit facilities. In certain limited instances, such downgrades may require the Company to return cash or assets to counterparties or to settle derivative and or other transactions with the respective counterparties. See Item 1, Business Ratings, for further information. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. Holding Company Liquidity As a holding company, XL Capital Ltd has no operations of its own and its assets consist primarily of its investments in its subsidiaries. Accordingly, XL Capital Ltds future cash flows depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries and states in which XL Capital Ltds subsidiaries operate, including, among others, Bermuda, New York, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. See Item 8, Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Statutory 117 Financial Data, for further discussion and details regarding dividend capacity of the Companys major operating subsidiaries. See Risk Factors Risks Related to the Company Because we are a holding company, if our subsidiaries do not make dividend and other payments to us, we may not be able to pay dividends or make payments on our debt securities and other obligations in Item 1A. The ability to pay such dividends is also limited by the regulations of the Society of Lloyds and certain contractual provisions. No assurance can be given that the Companys subsidiaries will pay dividends in the future to XL Capital Ltd. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, dividends of approximately $620 million were paid to XL Capital Ltd. from various subsidiaries. XL Capital Ltds principal uses of liquidity are for dividend payments to holders of its ordinary shares and preferred shares, interest and principal payments on debt, capital investments in its subsidiaries and corporate operating expenses. XL Capital Finance (Europe) plc (XLFE) is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of the XL Capital Ltd. In January 2002, XLFE issued $600 million par value 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2012. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by XL Capital Ltd. The Company and its subsidiaries provide no guarantees or other commitments (express or implied) of financial support to the Companys subsidiaries or affiliates, except for such guarantees or commitments that are in writing. See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Sources of Liquidity for the Company As at December 31, 2008, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.4 billion as compared to approximately $3.9 billion at December 31, 2007. There are three main sources of cash flows for the Company those provided by operations, investing activities and financing activities. Operating Cash Flows Historically, cash receipts from operations, consisting of premiums and investment income, generally have provided sufficient funds to pay losses as well as operating expenses of the Companys subsidiaries and to fund dividends to XL Capital Ltd. Cash receipts from operations is generally derived from the receipt of investment income on the Companys total investment portfolio as well as the net receipt of premiums less claims and expenses related to the Companys underwriting activities in its property and casualty operations as well as its Life Operations segment. The Companys operating subsidiaries provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to such premiums. Premiums and acquisition expenses are settled based on terms of trade as stipulated by an underwriting contract, and generally are received within the first year of inception of a policy when the premium is written, but can be up to three years on certain reinsurance business assumed. Operating expenses are generally paid within a year of being incurred. Claims especially for casualty business, may take a much longer time before they are reported and ultimately settled and this is why the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses. Therefore, the amount of claims paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net losses incurred, as reported in the consolidated statement of income. During the year ended 2008, net cash flows used in operating activities were $427.3 million primarily as a result of the payment of approximately $1.8 billion to Syncora under the Master Agreement. The Company funded the payment to Syncora by using proceeds from the offering of both ordinary shares and ESUs, as well as from the proceeds received following the exercise by the Company of the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility as described below. Excluding the payment to Syncora, net cash flows from operations was approximately $1.3 billion in 2008. For the same period in 2007, net cash flows from operations was $2.2 billion. The decrease in net cash flow from operations, excluding the payment to Syncora, was primarily as a result of decreases in net premiums written in the Companys P&C operations as described above and as a result of lower net investment income related to both P&C operations and structured products mainly due to a lower asset base and changes in the portfolio mix following the sale of assets used to settle the GIC liabilities. In addition, yields earned on investment of cash flows and reinvestment of maturing or sold securities have decreased, as prevailing market interest rates, in most major geographies, have decreased overall during the last twelve months. 118 Total net paid losses were $3.8 billion in each of 2008 and 2007, and $3.9 billion and 2006, respectively. Net losses incurred were $4.0 billion, $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Investing Cash Flows Generally, positive cash flow from operations and financing activities is invested in the Companys portfolio, including affiliates or acquisition of subsidiaries. Net cash provided by investing activities of $3.8 billion in 2008 was mainly associated with the sale and redemption of the Companys investments in fixed maturities, short term investments and equity securities. The sales of such securities exceeded related purchases, due mainly to the sale of assets used to settle the GIC liabilities and as a result of the Companys intention to reposition its investment portfolio and increase its holdings of cash as well as government agency holdings. Net cash used in investing activities in 2007 and 2006 was primarily related to the purchase and sale of portfolio investments, with purchases of investments exceeding the related sales and redemptions. In addition, in 2007, the Company sold a portion of its interest in Syncora, through a secondary offering for $316.3 million. However, as a result of the sale and subsequent deconsolidation of Syncora, investing cash flows were reduced by $110.8 million. If paid losses accelerate beyond the Companys ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows or events lead to negative cash flows from financing activities, the Company might need to either liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio or arrange for financing. Throughout 2008, the Companys investment portfolio has been significantly impacted by the current financial and credit crises and unprecedented market volatility, resulting in significant increases in both unrealized and realized losses. Such extreme volatility has negatively impacted market liquidity and as a result, many of the Companys assets, including certain fixed income and structured credit assets remain illiquid. However, to ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle claims, the Company holds a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short term investments and maintains available credit facilities. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was $4.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. In addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, the Company attempts to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration matched with the related liabilities. Certain of the Companys invested assets are held in trust and pledged in support of insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Such pledges are largely required by the Companys operating subsidiaries that are non admitted under U.S. state insurance regulations, in order for the U.S. cedant to receive statutory credit for reinsurance. In addition certain deposit liabilities and annuity contracts require the use of pledged assets. As at December 31, 2008 the Company had approximately $13.7 billion in pledged assets. Financing Cash Flows Cash flows related to financing activities include ordinary and preferred share related transactions, the payment of dividends, the issue or repayment of debt and deposit liability transactions. In order to fund the payment of approximately $1.8 billion to Syncora under the Master Agreement and the payment of approximately $283 million to consummate the redemption of X.L. America, Inc.s 6.58% Notes, the Company raised approximately $2.8 billion in August 2008 through an issuance of both ordinary shares and ESUs. Concurrent with the execution of the Master Agreement, the Company exercised the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility entered into in July 2003, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $500 million in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 20,000,000 Series C Preference Ordinary Shares, par value U.S. $0.01 per share (the Series C Preference Shares). For further details on these transactions, see Capital Resources, below. In July 2008, in conjunction with the issuance of ordinary shares and ESUs as described above, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.19 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in September 2008. In addition, in February 2009, the Board of Directors approved a further reduction in the quarterly dividend 119 payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.10 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in March 2009. As noted above, the Company settled during 2008, approximately $4.0 billion of GIC liabilities through the sale of certain assets from its fixed income portfolio. In addition, $1.2 billion of funding agreements were settled during 2008. At December 31, 2007, a significant component of the investments held in the Companys Other Financial Lines segment portfolios was comprised of Topical Assets and CDOs. Liquidations necessary to fund the repayment of the GIC liabilities following the downgrade of Syncora Guarantee and the maturity of certain funding agreements, were funded through sales of assets in these portfolios as well as the general investment portfolios. Managements approach was to avoid the sale of assets where current market prices did not reflect intrinsic values or where transaction costs for liquidation were excessive. As a result, the Company continues to hold a number of the Topical Assets and CDOs and these were transferred to the general investment portfolio in exchange for those assets that were liquidated. At December 31, 2008, the remaining balance of funding agreements, excluding accrued interest of $6.6 million, was $600.0 million, with settlements scheduled as follows: $150.0 million in October 2009 and $450.0 million in August 2010. The Company continues to manage its liquidity needs through changes in the mix of its investment portfolio as well as through other available capital resources and lines of credit as noted below. In 2007, the Company repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of ordinary shares through its share repurchase programs and issued approximately $825.0 million of ordinary shares in connection with the maturity of the purchase contracts associated with the 6.5% Equity Security Units. In addition, the Company issued Series E preference ordinary shares for $1 billion and redeemed both its Series A and Series B preference ordinary shares for $230.0 million and $287.5 million, respectively. With regards to debt transactions in 2007, the Company purchased and retired the 2009 Senior Notes for $825.0 million in connection with the 6.5% Units and issued the 2027 Senior Notes for gross proceeds of approximately $324.4 million. In 2007, dividends paid were $274.0 million for ordinary shares and $69.5 million for preferred shares. In 2007, the Company paid out $360.0 million of net cash relating to deposit liability contracts. In 2006, the Company received $342.2 million related to the sale of a portion of its interest in Syncora through a primary offering. The Company is considered a Well Known Seasoned Issuer (WKSI) under the rules of the SEC. The Company maintains shelf registration statement on Form S 3 and is eligible for automatically effective future registration statements for the potential offering and sale of an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities. The Registration Statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: (i) debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the Company, (ii) preferred securities of any of one or more capital trusts organized by the Company and guarantees of such securities by the Company and (iii) debt securities of XL Capital Finance (Europe) plc and guarantees of such securities by the Company. In addition the Company maintains letter of credit facilities which provide liquidity. Details of these facilities are described below in Capital Resources. Capital Resources In addition to ordinary share capital, the Company depends on external sources of financing to support its underwriting activities in the form of: a. debt; b. preference shares; c. contingent capital; and d. letter of credit facilities and other sources of collateral. In particular, the Company requires, among other things: 120 sufficient capital to maintain its financial strength and credit ratings, as issued by several ratings agencies, at levels considered necessary by management to enable the Companys key operating subsidiaries to compete. sufficient capital to enable its regulated subsidiaries to meet the regulatory capital levels required in the U.S., the U.K., Bermuda, Ireland, Switzerland and other key markets. letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are required to be posted or deposited, as the case may be, by the Companys operating subsidiaries that are non admitted under U.S. state insurance regulations in order for the U.S. cedant to receive statutory credit for reinsurance. The Company also uses letters of credit to support its operations at Lloyds revolving credit to meet short term liquidity needs. The following risks are associated with the Companys requirement to renew its credit facilities in future years: the credit available from banks may be reduced resulting in the Companys need to pledge its investment portfolio to customers. This could result in a lower investment yield. the Company may be downgraded by one or more rating agencies which could materially and negatively impact the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. the volume of business that the Companys subsidiaries that are not admitted in the U.S. are able to transact could be reduced if the Company is unable to renew its letter of credit facilities at an appropriate amount. Continued consolidation within the banking industry may result in the aggregate amount of credit provided to the Company being reduced. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by identifying and or selecting additional banks that can participate in the credit facilities upon renewal. a) Share Capital At December 31, 2008, the Company had total combined common and preferred share capital of $6.6 billion. In addition to ordinary and preferred share capital, the Company depends on external sources of financing such as debt, credit facilities and contingent capital to support its underwriting activities. The continuation of the current capital and credit market disruption, as well as any future disruptions or rating agency actions, could limit the Companys ability to raise capital in the future. If the Companys sources of liquidity described above prove to be insufficient, the Company may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Pursuant to the Companys shelf registration statement, the Company issued 143.8 million Class A ordinary shares in August 2008 at a price of $16.00 per share, with net proceeds totaling approximately $2.2 billion. The proceeds were used to fund the payments described above in relation to the Master Agreement as well as to redeem X.L. Americas 6.58% Notes as described below. In addition, proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and capital funding for certain of the Companys subsidiaries. In addition, as part of the Master Agreement, the Company issued 8,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, valued at $16.00 per share, to Syncora and its subsidiaries. The shares are subject to a registration rights agreement. In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.19 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in September 2008. In addition, in February 2009, the Board of Directors approved a further reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.10 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in March 2009. The Companys Rights Plan expired in accordance with its terms on September 30, 2008. Rights to purchase Class A ordinary shares (the Rights) were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one Right for each Class A ordinary share held of record as of the close of business on October 31, 1998. Each Right entitled holders of Class A ordinary shares to buy additional ordinary shares with a value of $700 at the then current market price, at an exercise price of $350. The Rights would have been exercisable, and would have detached from the Class A ordinary shares, only if a person or group were to have acquired 20% or more of the Companys outstanding Class A ordinary shares, or were to have announced a tender or 121 exchange offer that, if consummated, would have resulted in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of Class A ordinary shares. Upon a person or group without prior approval of the Board acquiring 20% or more of Class A ordinary shares, each Right would have entitled the holder (other than such an acquiring person or group) to purchase Class A ordinary shares (or, in certain circumstances, Class A ordinary shares of the acquiring person) with a value of twice the Rights exercise price upon payment of the Rights exercise price. The Company would have been entitled to redeem the Rights at $0.01 per Right at any time until the close of business on the tenth day after the Rights became exercisable. In 2007, in connection with the maturity of the purchase contracts associated with the 6.5% Units, the Company issued 10,799,913 Class A ordinary shares for net proceeds of approximately $823.0 million, a portion of which was used to retire the 2009 Senior Notes. On September 24, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its Class A ordinary shares. During the year ended December 31, 2008, no share repurchases were made under the share repurchase program. As at December 31, 2008, the Company could repurchase $375.5 million of its equity securities under the share repurchase program. In February 2009, in connection with the maturity of the purchase contracts associated with the 7.00% Units, the Company issued 11,461,080 Class A ordinary shares for net proceeds of approximately $743.1 million, which was used to retire the 2011 Senior Notes. b) Debt Concurrent with the issuance of Class A ordinary shares as described above and pursuant to the Companys shelf registration statement, the Company, in August 2008, issued 23.0 million 10.75% Equity Security Units (the 10.75% Units) in a public offering in order to fund payments described above in relation to the Master Agreement and remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The Company received approximately $557.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of the 10.75% Units after deducting underwriting discounts. Each 10.75% Unit has a stated amount of $25 and consists of (a) a purchase contract pursuant to which the holder agreed to purchase, for $25, a variable number of shares of the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares on August 15, 2011 and (b) a one fortieth, or 2.5%, ownership interest in a senior note issued by the Company due August 15, 2021 with a principal amount of $1,000 (the 2021 Senior Notes ). The 2021 Senior Notes are pledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase contract. The number of shares issued under the purchase contract is contingently adjustable based on, among other things, the share price of the Company on the stock purchase date and the dividend rate of the Company. The Company will make quarterly payments at the annual rate of 2.50% and 8.25% under the purchase contracts and senior notes, respectively. For all periods reported, the Company may defer the contract payments on the purchase contract, but not the senior notes, until the stock purchase date. In August 2011, the senior notes will be remarketed whereby the interest rate on the senior notes will be reset in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the 10.75% Unit holders obligations under the purchase contracts. If the senior notes are not successfully remarketed, then the Company will exercise its rights as a secured party and may retain or dispose of the senior notes to satisfy, in full, the 10.75% Unit holders obligations to purchase its ordinary shares under the purchase contracts. In connection with this transaction, $37.9 million, which is the estimated fair value of the purchase contract, was charged to Additional paid in capital and a corresponding liability was established. Of the $18.0 million total accrued costs associated with the issuance of the 10.75% Units, $14.7 million was charged to Additional paid in capital with the remainder deferred and amortized over the term of the senior debt. The number of ordinary shares to be issued under each purchase contract depends on, among other things, the average market price of the ordinary shares on the settlement date. The maximum number of ordinary shares to be issued under the purchase contracts is approximately 35.9 million. The Company accounts for the effect on the number of weighted average ordinary shares, assuming dilution, using the treasury stock method. The purchase contract component of the 10.75% Units will have no effect on the number of weighted average ordinary shares, assuming dilution, except when the average market price of 122 the Companys ordinary shares is above the threshold appreciation price of $18.88 per share. Because the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period the 10.75% Units were outstanding was below this price, the shares issuable under the purchase contracts were excluded from the computation of net income per ordinary share assuming dilution for the year ended December 31, 2008. As noted above, the Company utilized a portion of the net proceeds from the capital raising activities described above, to redeem, in August 2008, X.L. America, Inc.s $255 million 6.58% Notes. In connection with the early redemption of the 6.58% Notes, the Company incurred debt extinguishment costs of approximately $22.5 million. At December 31, 2008, banks and investors provided the Company and its subsidiaries with $4.3 billion of debt capacity, of which $3.2 billion was utilized by the Company. These facilities consist of: revolving credit facilities of $1.1 billion in aggregate. senior Unsecured Notes of approximately $3.2 billion. These notes require the Company to pay a fixed rate of interest during their terms. At December 31, 2008, there were six outstanding issues of senior unsecured notes: $745 million of the 2011 Senior Notes. These securities were a component of the 7.00% Equity Security Units (the 7.00% Units) that were publicly traded. As noted above, in February 2009, the 2011 Senior Notes were retired using the proceeds from the issuance of Class A ordinary shares in connection with the maturity of the purchase contracts associated with the 7.00% Units. $600 million senior notes due January 2012, with a fixed coupon of 6.5%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at $99.469 and gross proceeds were $596.8 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $7.9 million. $600 million senior notes due September 2014, with a fixed coupon of 5.25%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued in two tranches of $300 million aggregate principal amount each one tranche at 99.432% and the other at 98.419%. Aggregate gross proceeds were $593.6 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $4 million. $575 million of senior notes due August 2021, with a fixed coupon of 8.25%. These securities are a component of the 10.75% Units that are publicly traded. In addition to the coupon paid on the senior notes, quarterly contract adjustment payments at an annual rate of 2.50% per annum are paid on forward purchase contracts for the Companys common shares for a total distribution of 10.75% per annum. The purchase contracts mature in 2011, and the senior notes mature in 2021. In August 2011, the senior notes will be remarketed whereby the interest rate will be reset in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the 10.75% Unit holders obligations under the purchase contract. $350 million senior notes due November 2024, with a fixed coupon of 6.375%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at 100.0% and gross proceeds were $350 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $2 million. $325 million of senior notes due 2027, with a fixed coupon of 6.25%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at 99.805% and gross proceeds were $324.4 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $2.5 million. 123 The following tables present the Companys debt under outstanding securities and lenders commitments as at December 31, 2008: Notes Payable and Debt(U.S. dollars in thousands) Commitment In Use Year ofExpiry Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years After 5Years 5 year revolvers (1) $ 1,000,000 $ 2010 2012 / $ $ $ $ 5 year revolver 100,000 2010 5.25% Senior Notes 745,000 745,000 2011 745,000 6.50% Guaranteed Senior Notes 599,032 599,032 2012 600,000 5.25% Senior Notes 596,283 596,283 2014 600,000 8.25% Senior Notes 575,000 575,000 2021 575,000 6.375% Senior Notes 350,000 350,000 2024 350,000 6.25% Senior Notes 324,419 324,419 2027 325,000 $ 4,289,734 $ 3,189,734 $ $ 745,000 $ 600,000 $ 1,850,000 Commitment and In Use data represent December 31, 2008 accreted values. Payments Due by Period data represent ultimate redemption values. (1) The 2010 and 2012 5 year revolving credit facilities share a $1.0 billion revolving credit sublimit. c) Preference shares On March 15, 2007, the Company issued 1,000,000 Fixed/Floating Series E Perpetual Non Cumulative Preference Ordinary Shares, par value $0.01 per share, with liquidation preference US$1,000 per share (the Series E Preference Shares). The Company received net proceeds of approximately $983.8 million from the offering. Until April 15, 2017, dividends on the Series E Preference Shares are payable semiannually on a non cumulative basis, when, as and if declared by the Companys Board of Directors, on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing in 2007, at a fixed rate equal to 6.5% per annum on the liquidation preference. From and after April 15, 2017, dividends on the Series E Preference Shares are payable quarterly on a non cumulative basis, when, as and if declared by the Companys Board of Directors, on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 2.4575% on the liquidation preference. The Series E Preference Shares are perpetual securities with no fixed maturity date and are not convertible into any of the Companys other securities. On August 14, 2007, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 8.0% Series A Preference Ordinary Shares (the Series A Preference Shares) for approximately $25.24 per Series A Preference Share including accrued dividends. The aggregate redemption price was approximately $232.2 million. On November 18, 2007, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 7.625% Series B Preference Ordinary Shares (the Series B Preference Shares) for approximately $25.26 per Series B Preference Share including accrued dividends. The aggregate redemption price was approximately $290.5 million. Redeemable preference shares Concurrent with the execution of the Master Agreement, the Company exercised the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility entered into in July 2003, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $500 million in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 20,000,000 Series C Preference Ordinary Shares, par value U.S. $0.01 per share (the Series C Preference Shares). The liquidation preference of the Series C Preference Shares is $25 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company may redeem the Series C Preference Shares, in whole or in part, on or after July 15, 2013, at a redemption price of $25 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company may, under certain circumstances, redeem the Series C Preference Shares before July 15, 2013 at specific redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. These circumstances include an amalgamation, consolidation or other similar transaction involving the Company in which the Series C Preference Shares are entitled to a class vote ($26 per share redemption price), or a change in tax laws that requires the Company to pay additional amounts with respect to the Series C Preference Shares ($25 per share redemption price). The Series C Preference Shares may be redeemed by the holders after July 15, 2033. Until July 15, 2013, dividends on the Series C Preference Shares are payable semiannually on a cumulative 124 basis, when, as and if declared by the Companys Board of Directors, on January 15 and July 15 of each year at a fixed rate equal to 6.102% per annum on the liquidation preference. From and after July 15, 2013, dividends on the Series C Preference Shares are payable quarterly on a cumulative basis, when, as and if declared by the Companys Board of Directors, on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 3.145% on the liquidation preference. The Series C Preference Shares have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and are not convertible into any of the Companys other securities. On February 27, 2009, the Company initiated a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding Series C Preference Shares. d) Contingent Capital In addition to funded debt transactions, the Company has previously entered into contingent capital transactions. As noted above, in August 2008, the Company exercised the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility entered into in July 2003, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $500 million in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 20,000,000 Series C Preference Shares. At December 31, 2008, the Company has one contingent capital transaction where the outstanding put option has not been exercised. No up front proceeds were received by the Company under this transaction, however, in the event that the associated irrevocable put option agreement is exercised, proceeds previously raised from investors from the issuance of pass through trust securities would be received in return for the issuance of preferred shares. See below for further details on this transaction. On December 5, 2006, the Company and certain operating subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into a securities issuance agreement (the Securities Issuance Agreement), and certain of its foreign insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the Reinsurance Agreement), Stoneheath Re (Stoneheath). The net effect of these agreements to the Company is the creation of a contingent put option to issue $350.0 million of preference ordinary shares in the aggregate. The agreements provide the Company with a Reinsurance Collateral Account in support of certain Covered Perils named in the Reinsurance Agreement. The Covered Perils include United States wind, European wind, California earthquake and terrorism worldwide. After an initial three month period, the covered perils as well as the attachment points and aggregate retention amounts may be changed by the Ceding Insurers in their sole discretion. This may result in a material increase or decrease in the likelihood of payment under the Reinsurance Agreement. On each date on which a Ceding Insurer withdraws funds from the Reinsurance Collateral Account, the Company shall issue and deliver to Stoneheath an amount of XL Capital Ltd Series D Preference Shares (the XL Preferred Securities) having an aggregate liquidation preference that is equal to the amount of funds so withdrawn from the Collateral Account. The Company is obligated to reimburse Stoneheath for certain fees and ordinary expenses. The initial term of the Reinsurance Agreement will be for the period from the Closing Date through June 30, 2007, with four annual mandatory extensions through June 30, 2011 (unless coverage is exhausted thereunder prior to such date). The Ceding Insurers may thereafter extend the Reinsurance Agreement at their option for additional calendar quarters without limit (unless coverage is exhausted there under). The contingent put option is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The XL Preferred Securities, if issued, will pay dividends on a non cumulative basis at a fixed rate of 6.868% per annum through October 15, 2011 and thereafter at a floating rate based on 3 month LIBOR, plus 3.12%. 125 e) Letter of Credit Facilities and other sources of collateral At December 31, 2008, the Company had six letter of credit facilities in place with total availability of $6.9 billion, of which $3.7 billion was utilized. Other Commercial Commitments(U.S. dollars in thousands) Commitment In Use Year ofExpiry Amount of CommitmentExpiration per period Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years After 5Years Letter of Credit Facility $ 150,000 $ 142,783 Continuous $ 150,000 $ $ $ Letter of Credit Facility (1) 2,250,000 2010 2,250,000 Letter of Credit Facility (1) 4,000,000 3,071,765 2012 4,000,000 Letter of Credit Facility 280 280 2009 280 Letter of Credit Facility 107 107 2009 107 Letter of Credit Facility 450,261 450,261 2009 450,261 Six letter of credit facilities $ 6,850,648 $ 3,665,196 $ 600,648 $ 2,250,000 $ 4,000,000 $ (1) Of the total letter of credit facilities above, $1 billion is also included in the revolvers under notes payable and debt. Renewals of these commercial facilities are subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by the Company, or other financial institutions. In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedants. This could take the form of insurance trusts supported by the Companys investment portfolio or funds withheld (amounts retained by ceding companies to collateralize loss or premium reserves) using the Companys cash resources or combinations thereof. The face amount of letters of credit required is driven by, among other things, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business. In addition to letters of credit, the Company has established insurance trusts in the U.S. that provide cedants with statutory credit for reinsurance under state insurance regulation in the U.S. The Company reviews current and projected collateral requirements on a regular basis, as well as new sources of collateral. Managements objective is to maintain an excess amount of collateral sources over expected uses. The Company also reviews its liquidity needs on a regular basis. The following letter of credit facilities were originated, renewed or terminated during 2008: On November 30, 2008, the 450 million letter of credit facility issued on November 14, 2007 that was supporting the Companys syndicates at Lloyds of London terminated. However, this facility was structured so that the letters of credit issued on it are effective and support the syndicates for the 2009 underwriting year. Cross Default and Other Provisions in Debt Instruments The following describes certain terms of the documents referred to below. All documents referred to below have been filed with the SEC and should be referred to for an assessment of the complete contractual obligations of the Company. In general, all of the Companys bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Companys outstanding indebtedness, including the credit facilities discussed above (collectively, the Companys Debt Documents), contain cross default provisions to each other and the Companys Debt Documents contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, among other things, minimum required ratings of the Companys insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries and the level of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generally each of the Companys Debt Documents provide for an event of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or some events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. A downgrade below A of the Companys principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by either S&P or A.M. Best, which is two notches below the current S&P financial strength rating of A (Negative) and the A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Stable) of these subsidiaries, may trigger cancellation provisions in a significant amount of the Companys assumed reinsurance agreements and may potentially require the Company to return unearned premiums to cedants. In addition, due to collateral posting requirements under the Companys letter of credit and revolving credit facilities, such a downgrade may 126 require the posting of cash collateral in support of certain in use portions of these facilities (see Liquidity and Capital Resources). Specifically, a downgrade below A by A.M. Best would trigger such collateral requirements for the Companys two largest credit facilities. In certain limited instances, such downgrades may require the Company to return cash or assets to counterparties or to settle derivative and or other transactions with the respective counterparties. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. Under the Companys 2 year Lloyds and five year U.S. credit facilities placement notes described above, in the event that the XL Capital Group, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least A from A.M. Best, an event of default would occur. The 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures contain a cross default provision. In general, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $50.0 million or more, an event of default would be triggered under the Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures. Given that all of the Companys Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due and payable and an acceleration of all debt due under those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness. In addition, the Companys unsecured Lloyds letter of credit facility provides that, in the event that the Companys insurance and reinsurance rated operating subsidiaries in Bermuda fall below a rating of A from A.M. Best, the facility would then be required to be fully secured by the Company, at which time the Company would be required to either (i) provide an amount in cash to cover an amount equal to the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time or (ii) deposit assets in trust securing 105% of the aggregate letters of credit outstanding at that time. Long Term Contractual Obligations The following table presents the Companys long term contractual obligations and related payments as at December 31, 2008, due by period. This table excludes further commitments of $104.5 million to the Companys related investment funds and certain limited partnerships, and letter of credit facilities of $3.7 billion. See Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments, and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. See Item 8, Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes Payable and Debt and Financing Arrangements, for further information.

The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on payments due in the future. The payment related to these liabilities varies primarily based on interest rates. The ultimate payments associated with these liabilities could differ from the Companys estimate. See Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Deposit Liabilities, for further information. (2) Future policy benefit reserves related to Life operations were $5,452,865 on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008. Amounts included above include an allowance for future premiums in respect of contracts under which premiums are payable throughout the life of the underlying policy. The value of the discount is also included for those lines of business that have reserves where future claim payments and future premium receipts can be estimated using actuarial principles. 127 The timing and amounts of actual claims payments and premium receipts related to these reserves vary based on the underlying experience of the portfolio. Typical elements of the experience include mortality, morbidity and persistency. The ultimate amount of the claims payments and premium receipts could differ materially from the Companys estimated amounts. (3) The unpaid loss and loss expenses were $21,650,315 on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008. The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on certain workers compensation and financial guarantee liabilities. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments related to these P&C and financial guarantee reserves vary based on many factors including large individual losses, changes in the legal environment, as well as general market conditions. The ultimate amount of the claims payments could differ materially from the Companys estimated amounts. For information regarding the estimates for unpaid loss and loss expenses as well as factors effecting potential payment patterns of reserves for actual and potential claims related the Companys different lines of business see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Certain lines of business written by the Company, such as excess casualty, have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns and, therefore, may impact the related asset/liability investment management process. In order to be in a position, if necessary, to make these payments, the Companys liquidity requirements are supported by having revolving lines of credit facilities available to the Company and significant reinsurance programs, in addition to the Companys general high grade fixed income investment portfolio. Variable Interest Entities and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At times, the Company has utilized variable interest entities both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of the Companys business. The Company invests in CDOs, and other investment vehicles that are issued through variable interest entities as part of the Companys risk asset portfolio. On December 5, 2006, the Company and certain operating subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into a securities issuance agreement (the Securities Issuance Agreement), and certain of its foreign insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the Reinsurance Agreement), with Stoneheath Re (Stoneheath). The net effect of these agreements to the Company is the creation of a contingent put option in the amount of $350.0 million in the aggregate. The agreements provide the Company with a Reinsurance Collateral Account in support of certain Covered Perils named in the Reinsurance Agreement. The Covered Perils include United States wind, European wind, California earthquake and terrorism worldwide. After an initial three month period, the covered perils as well as the attachment points and aggregate retention amounts may be changed by the Ceding Insurers in their sole discretion. This may result in a material increase or decrease in the likelihood of payment under the Reinsurance Agreement. On each date on which a Ceding Insurer withdraws funds from the Reinsurance Collateral Account, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Issuer an amount of XL Capital Ltd Series D Preference Shares having an aggregate liquidation preference that is equal to the amount of funds so withdrawn from the Collateral Account. The Company is obligated to reimburse Stoneheath for certain fees and ordinary expenses. The initial term of the Reinsurance Agreement was for the period from the Closing Date through June 30, 2007, with four annual mandatory extensions thereafter through June 30, 2011 (unless coverage is exhausted there under prior to such date). The Ceding Insurers may thereafter extend the Reinsurance Agreement at their option for additional calendar quarters without limit (unless coverage is exhausted there under). The contingent put option is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Stoneheath preferred securities and, if issued, the XL Series D Preference Shares will pay dividends on a non cumulative basis at a fixed rate of 6.868% per annum through October 15, 2011 and thereafter at a floating rate based on 3 month LIBOR, plus 3.12%.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and value at risk (VaR) analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of the Companys investment portfolio. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See 129 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial and other instruments. The Company is principally exposed to the following market risks: interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk; equity price risk; credit risk; legacy weather and energy related risk, and other related market risks. For a discussion of related risks, see the risk factor titled We are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in Item 1A Risk Factors, above. The Companys investment market risk arises from its investment portfolio which consists of fixed income securities, alternative investments, public equities, private investments, derivatives, other investments, and cash, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and other related market risks. The Companys fixed income and equity securities are classified as available for sale, and as such, changes in interest rates, credit spreads on corporate and structured credit, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or other related market instruments will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income or loss and shareholders equity but may not have an immediate effect on net income. Changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and other related market instruments affect consolidated net income when, and if, a security is sold or impaired. The Company conducts its derivative activities primarily in investment related derivatives, which may include credit derivatives, and previously within weather and energy derivatives. From time to time, the Company uses investment derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of its investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. The Companys derivative transactions can expose or have exposed the Company to credit derivative risk, weather and energy risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, etc. The Company attempts to manage these risks based on guidelines established by senior management and approved by the Finance and Risk Oversight Committee. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value with the resulting changes in fair value recognized in income in the period in which they occur. Credit derivatives are purchased within the Companys investment portfolio, have been sold through a limited number of contracts written as part of the Companys previous XL Financial Solutions business, and were previously entered into through the Companys prior reinsurance agreements with Syncora. Following the closing of the Master Agreement which terminated certain reinsurance and other agreements, these credit derivative exposures were eliminated by virtue of the commutation of the relevant reinsurance agreement. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining credit derivative exposure outside of the Companys investment portfolio consisted of 23 contracts written by the Company that provide credit protection on senior tranches of structured finance transactions with total net par values outstanding of $639.5 million, a weighted average contractual term to maturity of 5.7 years, a total liability recorded of $28.6 million, and an average rating of AA on the underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2008, there have been no reported events of default on the underlying obligations. This risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and VaR analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of the Companys investment portfolio. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See generally Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Item 2. Interest Rate Risk The Companys fixed income portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates generally would decrease the fair value of the Companys investment portfolio, offset by the Companys ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates generally would increase the fair value of the Companys investment portfolio, offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested. 130 The Company manages interest rate risk within the context of its overall asset liability management strategy by setting duration targets for its investment portfolio in line with the estimated duration of its liabilities, thus mitigating the overall economic effect of interest rate risk. The Company remains nevertheless exposed to accounting interest rate risk since the assets are marked to market, thus subject to market conditions, while liabilities are accrued at a static rate. The hypothetical case of an immediate 100 basis point adverse parallel shift in global bond curves as at December 31, 2008, would decrease the fair value of the Companys fixed income portfolio by approximately 4.2% or $1.3 billion. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Many of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses arise for accounting purposes where net assets or liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the functional currency of those subsidiaries. While unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on underwriting balances are reported in earnings, the offsetting unrealized gains and losses on invested assets are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, to the extent that the asset currency does not match that entitys functional currency. This results in an accounting mismatch that will result in foreign exchange gains or loss in the consolidated statements of income depending on the movement in certain currencies. In order to improve administrative efficiencies as well as to address this accounting imbalance, the Company formed several branches with Euro and U.K. Sterling functional currencies during 2006, 2007 and 2008. Management continues to focus on attempting to limit this type of exposure in the future. Foreign currency exchange rate risk in general is reviewed as part of the Companys risk management process. Foreign exchange contracts within the investment portfolio are utilized to manage individual portfolio foreign exchange exposures, subject to investment manager guidelines established by management. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. These contracts generally have maturities of three months or less. The Company also attempts to manage the foreign exchange volatility arising on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These include, but are not limited to, premium receivable, reinsurance contracts, claims payable and investments in subsidiaries. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for the Company are the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Swiss Franc, and the Canadian dollar. The Companys net notional foreign currency denominated exposure on foreign exchange contracts was $186.2 million and $341.7 million as at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, with a net unrealized loss of $3.2 million and a net unrealized gain of $0.9 million as at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Equity Price Risk The Companys equity portfolio as well as certain derivatives and certain affiliate investments are exposed to equity price risk. Equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the market value of equities. An immediate hypothetical 10% change in the value of each equity position in the Companys equity portfolio would affect the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $33.0 million as at December 31, 2008. As at December 31, 2008, the Companys equity portfolio was approximately $330 million as compared to approximately $757 million as at December 31, 2007. This excludes fixed income fund investments and publicly traded alternative funds that generally do not have the risk characteristics of equity investments. As at December 31, 2008, the Companys allocation to equity securities was approximately 1.1% of the total investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased) as compared to approximately 1.7% as at December 31, 2007. As at December 31, 2008, approximately 10.5% of the equity holdings was invested in U.S. companies as compared to approximately 28.8% as at December 31, 2007. As at December 31, 2008, the top ten equity holdings represented approximately 10.4% of the Companys total equity portfolio as compared to approximately 11.5% as at December 31, 2007. 131 For further discussion of the exporsure to equity market movements in the Companys investment portfolio see the Investment Value at Risk (VaR) section below. Credit Risk The Companys exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads will increase the net unrealized loss position of the investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit based non qualifying derivatives where the Company assumes credit exposure, and, if issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an extended period of time, would likely result in higher other than temporary impairments. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of the Companys securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Credit spreads on both corporate and structured securities widened during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting in continuing depressed pricing. Continuing challenges include continued weakness in the U.S. real estate market and increased mortgage delinquencies, investor anxiety over the U.S. economy, rating agency downgrades of various structured products and financial issuers, unresolved issues with structured investment vehicles and monolines, deleveraging of financial institutions and alternative funds and a serious dislocation in the inter bank market. If significant, continued volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in credit spreads and defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market liquidity, declines in equity prices, and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions. The Companys exposure to market movements related to credit risk is primarily due to its investment portfolio, receivable and ceded reinsurance balances. Within the investment portfolio, credit risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the creditworthiness of individual investment holdings, issuers, groups of issuers, industries or countries. In addition, credit risk pertains to adverse change in the creditworthiness of the Companys reinsurers and retrocessionaires, and their ability to pay certain reinsurance receivable and recoverable balances. The hypothetical case of an immediate 25 basis point increase in all the global corporate and structured credit spreads to which the Companys fixed income portfolio is exposed to at December 31, 2008 would decrease the fair value of the Companys fixed income portfolio by approximately $243.4 million. This excludes exposure to credit in the Companys alternative investments. The Company manages credit risk in the investment portfolio, including fixed income, alternative and short term investment through the credit research performed primarily by the external investment professionals and limitations on the investment portfolios exposure to individual credits. Credit limits for corporate exposures are based on an internal model that allows the limits to be linked to the Companys balance sheet credit risk taking capacity while also taking into consideration internal views on specific issuers and on current or expected market credit conditions. Credit limits for other sectors are derived from the corporate limits using multipliers as a way to quantify intrinsic credit quality characteristics differences with the corporate sector. Limits are reviewed annually and ensure that potential losses from individual defaults should not exceed predetermined levels. In the investment portfolio, the Company reviews on a regular basis its issuer concentration, credit quality and compliance with established credit limits. Any issuer over its credit limits, experiencing financial difficulties, material credit quality deterioration or potentially subject to forthcoming credit quality deterioration is placed on a watch list for closer monitoring. Where appropriate, exposures are reduced or prevented from increasing. The Company has also developed a proprietary model for the investment portfolio to assess corporate credit risk based upon its individual holdings mark to market exposure, credit rating, seniority in the capital structure, migration and default probabilities, durations, default correlations and loss severity given a default event. Based upon these factors and related market based inputs, the Company can estimate the credit risk of the Companys investment portfolio and its various components. Assumptions are reviewed regularly to ensure the risk estimates are reasonable and reflect underlying exposures. 132 The table below shows the Companys fixed income portfolio by credit rating in percentage terms of the Companys total fixed income exposure (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) as at December 31, 2008. Total AAA 53.9 AA 21.1 A 15.7 BBB 6.8 BB & below 2.4 NR 0.1 Total 100.0 % At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the average credit quality of the Companys total fixed income portfolio was AA. The Companys $13.2 billion portfolio of government, agency, sovereign and cash holdings was rated AAA at December 31, 2008. The Companys $10.1 billion portfolio of corporates is rated A, which includes $4.6 billion of corporate financial issues which are A+ rated. The Companys $8.6 billion structured credit portfolio is AA+ rated. The Company is closely monitoring its corporate financial bond holdings in light of the current credit market conditions.

Credit derivatives are purchased within the Companys investment portfolio, have been sold through a limited number of contracts written as part of the Companys previous XL Financial Solutions business, and were previously entered into through the Companys prior reinsurance agreements with Syncora, as described below. From time to time, the Company may purchase credit default swaps to hedge an existing position or concentration of holdings. The credit derivatives are recorded at fair value. Following the secondary sale of Syncora common shares, the Company retained some credit derivative exposures written by Syncora and certain of its subsidiaries through reinsurance agreements that had certain derivatives exposures embedded within them. Following the closing of the Master Agreement which terminated certain reinsurance and other agreements, these credit derivative exposures were eliminated by virtue of the commutation of the relevant reinsurance agreements. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining credit derivative exposure outside of the Companys investment portfolio consisted of 23 contracts written by the Company that provide credit protection on senior tranches of structured finance transactions with total net par values outstanding of $639.5 million, a weighted average contractual term to maturity of 5.7 years, a total liability recorded of $28.6 million, and an average rating of AA on the underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2008, there have been no reported events of default on the underlying obligations. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, alternatives and other investment funds and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the Companys counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure that is due. The Company also has exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions, revolving credit facility and letter of credit commitments and equity investments. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. With regards to unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable, the Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due to the Company; however, these exposures are not marked to market. For further information relating to reinsurer credit risk, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable. 135 The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the other parties to its derivative instruments in general; however, the Company does not anticipate non performance. The difference between the notional principal amounts and the associated market value is the Companys maximum credit exposure. Weather and Energy Risk Prior to August 2008, the Company previously offered weather and contingent energy risk management products in insurance or derivative form to end users and managed the risks in the OTC and exchange traded derivatives markets or through the use of quota share or excess of loss arrangements. However, as part of the Companys strategy to focus on its core Insurance and Reinsurance P&C operations, the Company, in August 2008, closed this unit and ceased writing such weather and energy risk management products. Fair values for the Companys existing portfolio of previously written speculative natural gas derivative contracts are determined through the use of quoted market prices. As quoted market prices are not widely available in the weather derivative market, management uses available market data and internal pricing models based upon consistent statistical methodologies to estimate fair values. Estimating fair value of instruments that do not have quoted market prices requires managements judgment in determining amounts that could reasonably be expected to be received from, or paid to, a third party in respect of the contracts. The amounts could be materially different from the amounts that might be realized in an actual sale transaction. Fair values are subject to change in the near term and reflect managements best estimate based on various factors including, but not limited to, realized and forecasted weather conditions, changes in interest rates and other market factors. Previously, when the Company offered weather and contingent energy risk management products, the Company managed its portfolio of such products through the employment of a variety of strategies. These included geographical and directional diversification of risk exposures and direct hedging within the capital and reinsurance markets. As at December 31, 2008, the Companys VaR related to these risks did not exceed $20.0 million in any one season. The majority of existing weather and energy contracts expired at the end of 2008 with the remainder of the portfolio expected to expire by mid 2009. Other Market Risks The Companys private investment portfolio is invested in limited partnerships and other entities which are not publicly traded. In addition to normal market risks, these positions may also be exposed to liquidity risk, risks related to distressed investments, and risks specific to startup or small companies. As at December 31, 2008, the Companys exposure to private investments was $404.8 million representing 1.2% of the fixed income portfolio compared to $427.5 million as at December 31, 2007. The Companys alternative investment portfolio, which is exposed to equity and credit risk as well as certain other market risks, had a total exposure of $1.1 billion making up approximately 3.2% of the total investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net payable for investments purchased) at December 31, 2008, as compared to December 31, 2007, where the Company had a total exposure of $2.3 billion representing approximately 5.2% of the total investment portfolio. The VaR associated with the alternative investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 was approximately $35.6 million. At December 31, 2008, bond and stock index futures outstanding had a net long position of $101.7 million as compared to a net short position of $384.5 million at December 31, 2007. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying exposure to these derivative instruments would have resulted in realized gains or realized losses of $10.2 million as at December 31, 2008 and $38.5 million as at December 31, 2007, respectively. The Company may reduce its exposure to these futures through offsetting transactions, including options and forwards. Investment Value at Risk (VaR) Central to the Companys market risk management framework is VaR. VaR is a statistical risk measure, calculating the level of potential losses that could be expected to be exceeded, over a specified 136 holding period and at a given level of confidence, in normal market conditions, due to adverse movements in the investment portfolios underlying securities and investments valuations. The Company uses VaR as a statistical risk measure of the two main components of its investment portfolio the Asset Liability Portfolio and the Risk Portfolio. The Asset Liability Portfolio principal objectives are to support the liabilities arising from the Companys operations, to produce a steady stream of investment income and to preserve capital. The Asset Liability portfolio is invested in investment grade fixed income and cash securities (fixed income instruments maturing one year or less at the time of issuance). The Risk Portfolio principal objective is to build book value over the long term. The Risk Portfolio is invested in equity securities, below investment grade fixed income securities, alternative investment strategies and private investments. The Company calculates the VaR of the investment portfolio using a one month time horizon and a 95% level of confidence. This means that, on average, the Company could expect marked to market results greater than predicted by the VaR results 5% of the time, or once every 20 months. The calculation of VaR is performed monthly using an analytical, or variance covariance approach, based on the linear sensitivity of the portfolio and individual securities to a broad set of systematic market risk factors and idiosyncratic risk factors. The Company computes the parametric sensitivity of every security in a portfolio to changes in key interest rates, spreads, implied volatility, equities, and foreign exchange rates. The parametric exposures are summed using the appropriate portfolio weights to compute a portfolios exposure to these systematic and idiosyncratic market risk factors. Results are expressed both in terms of U.S. dollars and as a percentage of the Companys investment portfolio. As part of the Companys ongoing initiatives to enhance its risk reporting activities, the Company has expanded its modeling capabilities and analytics to measure the VaR of the investment portfolio excluding the foreign exchange rate risk within the investment portfolio. Within its asset liability framework for the investment portfolio, the Company pursues a general policy of holding the assets and liabilities in the same currency and as such the Company is not exposed to the risks associated foreign exchanges movements within the investment portfolio, as currency impacts on the assets are generally matched by corresponding impacts on the related liabilities, and accordingly are neutral to the Companys book value. The Company considers that the investment portfolio VaR results excluding foreign exchange rate risk are the more relevant and appropriate metrics to consider when assessing the actual risk of the investment portfolio. The Company has implemented such analysis as of December 31, 2008 and expects to report the VaR of the investment portfolio excluding foreign exchange risk in future periods. The results for December 31, 2008 are reported in the table below. The modeling of the risk of any portfolio, as measured by VaR, involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While the Company believes that its assumptions and approximations are appropriate, there is no uniform industry methodology for calculating VaR. The Company notes that different VaR results can be produced for the same portfolio dependent not only on the approach used but also on the assumptions employed when implementing the approach. The VaR approach uses historical data to determine the sensitivity of each of the underlying securities to the risk factors incorporated into the pricing models employed in the VaR calculations. In calculating these sensitivities, greater importance is placed on the more recent data points and information. Since the VaR approach is based on historical positions and market data, VaR results should not be viewed as an absolute and predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for the Company to predict risk. There is no assurance that the Companys actual future losses will not exceed its VaR and the Company expects that 5% of the time the VaR will be exceeded. Additionally, the Company acknowledges the fact that risks associated with abnormal market events can be significantly different from the VaR results and these are by definition not reflected or assessed in the VaR analysis, rather this is evaluated using the Companys stress testing framework. The VaR of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 was approximately $1.5 billion including foreign exchange rate risk and $0.9 billion excluding foreign exchange rate risk. The VaR of all investment related derivatives excluding investments in affiliates and other investments was approximately $42.9 million. 137 In instances where the data or time series are insufficient to determine the risk factor sensitivities, the VaR approach uses proxy time series data available for similar instruments. As at December 31, 2008, approximately $5.8 billion used proxy time series data. Approximately $1.1 billion related to various fixed income portfolios (of which $0.5 billion was in mortgage backed and asset backed securities), $3.0 billion to various cash portfolios, $1.1 billion to alternative investments, $0.4 billion to private investments, $0.1 billion to equity portfolios, and nil to derivatives. The Company reviews the proxies to ensure that an appropriate data and time series is being used in the calculations and that the proxies used are conservative. The following table shows the Companys average, minimum and maximum VaR in percentage and dollar terms for the investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2008, based upon the VaR at quarter end dates. The table also includes the Companys VaR in percentage and dollar terms, respectively, for the investment portfolio as at December 31, 2008. The Companys investment portfolio VaR as at December 31, 2008 is not necessarily indicative of future VaR levels. The Company uses VaR as a statistical risk measure of the two main components of its investment portfolio only the Asset Liability Portfolio and the Risk Asset Portfolio.

(2) Based on a 95% confidence level with a one month holding period and expressed as a percentage of the investment portfolio excluding foreign exchange rate risk as described above. (3) Average Undiversified VaR for the year ended December 31, 2008 and Undiversified VaR at December 31, 2008 is the summation of the individual VaRs for the Asset Liability and Risk Asset portfolios and, by construction, ignores any and all correlations between these portfolios (and their underlying asset classes). The Undiversified VaR therefore ignores diversification benefits that exist in between these portfolios (and their respective underlying asset classes). Maximum and Minimum Undiversified VaR is not necessarily the summation of the individual VaRs for each of the separate portfolios since the Maximum and Minimum VaR and the Maximum and Minimum Undiversified VaR do not necessarily refer to the same point in time. (4) Diversification VaR equals the difference between the Investment Portfolio VaR and the Undiversified VaR. As the former explicitly accounts for the correlations and diversification benefits that exist between the Asset Liability and Risk Asset portfolios and the latter explicitly does not, the difference in the two VaR results is due to the diversification benefits. These diversification benefits arise due to the risk reduction that occurs when different assets, that are not perfectly correlated, are combined in a portfolio. It will vary over time dependent on: changes in allocations; changes in the correlations between the different underlying asset classes; and changes in the underlying asset class risks. The NA reflects the fact that, since the Minimum and Maximum VaR do not refer to the same point in time, it is therefore not meaningful to calculate the Diversification VaR. (5) Investment Portfolio VaR is based on the prescribed methodology that explicitly accounts for the diversification benefits that occur when each of the allocations to the Asset Liability and Risk Asset portfolios (and their underlying asset classes) are included in the investment portfolio. (6) Based on a 95% confidence level with a one month holding period, expressed in millions of U.S. Dollars. (7) Based on a 95% confidence level with a one month holding period, expressed in millions of U.S. Dollars excluding foreign exchange rate risk. (8) Investment Portfolio refers to the two main components of the Companys investment portfolio the Asset Liability Portfolio and the Risk Asset Portfolio. The Companys total investment portfolio VaR is driven by: the size of the overall investment portfolio; the size of the allocations to the different asset classes and securities in the asset classes; the risks 138 associated with each of the asset classes and securities; and the correlations and diversification benefits between each of the asset classes and securities. Changes in any of these variables will have a direct impact on the Companys VaR. Stress Testing VaR does not provide the means to estimate the magnitude of the loss in the 5% of occurrences that the Company expects the VaR level to be exceeded. To complement the VaR analysis based on normal market environments, the Company considers the impact on the investment portfolio in several different historical stress periods to analyze the effect of unusual market conditions. The Company establishes certain historical stress test scenarios which are applied to the actual investment portfolio. As these stress tests and estimated gains and losses are based on historical events, they will not necessarily reflect future stress events or gains and losses from such events. The results of the stress test scenarios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they are appropriate, based on current shareholders equity, market conditions and the Companys total risk tolerance. It is important to note that when assessing the risk of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company does not take into account either the value or risk associated with the liabilities arising from the Companys operations. Since the principal objectives of the Asset Liability portfolio component of the investment portfolio are to support and generally offset or hedge certain of the risks associated with the liabilities. The table below shows the maximum impact on the Companys investment portfolio including the impact of foreign exchange rates if all events stress tested were to repeat themselves, given the actual investment portfolios allocations at the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2008. The Company assumes that no action is taken during the stress period to either liquidate or rebalance the portfolio. The Company believes that this fairly reflects the potential decreased liquidity that is often associated with stressed market environments. Stress Test March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 (1) Maximum loss impact on portfolio (6.2 )% (6.3 )% (4.4 )% (7.3 )% Maximum gain impact on portfolio 18.9 % 19.5 % 18.9 % 20.1 % (1) In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company added an additional historical stress scenario to reflect the 2008 Credit Crisis. From the different scenarios that the Company analyzes, the largest downside event risk exposure during 2008 was 7.3%, based on the investment portfolio as at December 31, 2008. This largest downside event risk exposure of 7.3% is reflective of a new 2008 Credit Crisis stress test implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008 and assumes a repeat of the extreme volatility in the capital markets experienced the period from September 12, 2008 to November 3, 2008; the day before the Lehman bankruptcy announcement. Excluding this new stress test, the Maximum loss impact on the portfolio as of December 31 2008 was 4.8%. The largest upside risk exposure during 2008 was 20.1% as at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008 the Companys maximum loss impact and maximum gain impact on the investment portfolio were at their maximum month end ranges. The higher year end results were primarily a reflection of the extreme volatility levels observed in the level of interest rates, spread levels and other key risk factors during the fourth quarter of 2008 following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, Inc. Given the investment portfolio allocations as at December 31, 2008, the Company would expect to lose approximately 7.3% of the portfolio if the most damaging event stress tested (2008 Credit Crisis) was repeated, all other things held equal. Given the investment portfolio allocations as at December 31, 2008, the Company would expect to gain approximately 20.1% of the portfolio if the most favorable event stress tested was repeated, all other things held equal. 139
