The Company operates in markets where it believes its underwriting expertise and financial strength represent a relative advantage. The Company has grown through acquisitions and development of new business opportunities. Acquisitions included Global Capital Re in 1997, Mid Ocean Limited in 1998, ECS, Inc. and NAC Re Corp. in 1999, Winterthur International in 2001 and Le Mans Re in 2002. All acquisitions were entered into in order to further support the Companys strategic plan to develop a global platform in insurance and reinsurance. The Company competes as an integrated global business and at December 31, 2009 employed 3,565 employees in 24 countries. For further information in relation to the Companys Operations, see Item 1, Business. Underwriting Environment The Company earns its revenue primarily from net premiums written and earned. The property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, meaning that based on market conditions, there have been periods where premium rates are high and policy terms and conditions are more favorable to the Company (a hard market) and there have been periods where premium rates decline and policy terms and conditions are less favorable to the Company (a soft market). Market conditions are driven primarily by competition in the marketplace, the supply of capital in the industry, investment yields and the frequency and severity of loss events. Managements goal is to build long term shareholder value by capitalizing on current opportunities and managing through any cyclical downturns by reducing its property and casualty book of business and exposures if and when rates deteriorate to unprofitable levels. Insurance Throughout 2009, renewal pricing in the Insurance segment experienced a modest overall increase of 1% across the entire book as compared to a 6% decrease in rates for the same period a year ago. There was overall a steady improvement in pricing throughout the year, resulting in full year increases in specialty lines of 3% and casualty lines of 1% being offset by a decrease of 1 % in property lines while professional lines pricing has been flat. Premium volumes were also negatively impacted by global economic conditions, which drove ratable exposure bases down and reduced mergers and acquisitions activity. The impact of the ratings downgrade by Standard & Poors (S&P) in December 2008 affected premiums particularly in certain longer tail lines, but this impact continued to lessen throughout the year as the Companys financial position improved. The Company exited certain lines of business, non renewed certain programs, and was exposed to the ongoing efforts of risk managers to reduce concentrations of risk (limits) with all of their insurers. However, retention rates ended the year at just less than 80% for all lines of business with property and casualty lines in the low to mid 80s. In the fourth quarter of 2009 pricing showed continued improvement with a positive aggregate price change of 1.4% with notable positive price changes in professional of 2% and aerospace of 9% offset by a 2% reduction in property rates reflecting the markets recent pricing behavior. For further information on recent rate and renewal activity, see 2010 Underwriting Outlook below. 61 The following table provides an analysis of gross premiums written, net premiums written and net premiums earned for the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 (3) 2007 (3) GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned Casualty professional lines $ 1,423,756 1,336,541 1,276,005 $ 1,472,874 $ 1,351,237 $ 1,369,668 $ 1,516,412 $ 1,376,819 $ 1,404,567 Casualty other lines 947,121 570,887 655,126 1,273,016 793,512 822,252 1,342,817 848,919 819,687 Other property 649,592 361,841 426,441 886,418 503,387 471,283 886,321 592,208 587,863 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 644,898 516,408 546,806 747,311 604,786 621,774 809,073 623,085 638,162 Other specialty lines (1) 577,804 483,166 634,436 850,404 712,307 660,322 786,074 666,208 582,565 Other (2) 5,257 1,077 12,217 22,736 (22,908 ) (11,055 ) 36,698 27,439 33,416 Structured indemnity 3,460 3,460 8,762 56,155 42,505 62,801 56,871 52,177 50,328 Total $ 4,251,888 3,273,380 3,559,793 $ 5,308,914 $ 3,984,826 $ 3,997,045 $ 5,434,266 $ 4,186,855 $ 4,116,588 (1) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, specie, middle markets and excess and surplus lines.

Reinsurance Across the Reinsurance segment, market conditions during 2009 remained stable but competitive, with the majority of classes experiencing flat rate movement. US property catastrophe margins improved as rates increased by up to 8% on an exposure adjusted basis. Non US catastrophe rates were generally flat, but there was rate fluctuation in some territories from 5% to +5%. Non catastrophe property lines of business showed flat rates for the year. Loss activity provided momentum to increase aviation rates by 10% across the sector. US casualty rates were flat to down 5%, while non US casualty rates were flat where the market remained disciplined. July 1 is one of the main renewal periods for Latin American business and substantial capacity in the market for most lines, terms and conditions remained firm in the region.

The following sets forth potential trends relevant to the Companys property and casualty operations in 2010: 2010 Underwriting Outlook Given the challenging economic environment that has been experienced throughout 2008 and 2009 including the downgrade of the financial strength ratings of the Companys leading insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by leading rating agencies, the Company shifted focus to those lines of business 62 within its insurance and reinsurance operations that provide the best return on capital. As such, the Company has been highly selective on new business, emphasizing short tail lines, where applicable, in the Companys reinsurance operations, exiting other businesses (e.g., Casualty facultative business), non renewing certain insurance programs, as well as continuing to reduce long term agreements (within the insurance operations) in order to capture the benefit of hardening markets. Following the catastrophe activity of 2008, most notably, losses resulting from Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, and more importantly, following severe economic conditions and the impacts of the financial crisis, which reduced the available capital of many property and casualty (re)insurers, market capacity decreased and in conjunction, market pricing across most insurance and reinsurance lines of business began to improve in the early part of 2009. Despite these early improvements, credit spreads narrowed sharply throughout 2009, and the credit markets brought capital back into the market, strengthening balance sheets and putting increased pressure on market pricing. The following is a summary of the January 2010 rate indications and recent renewal activity for each of the Insurance and Reinsurance segments of the Company: Insurance With regard to market conditions within the core lines of business within the Insurance segment, fourth quarter 2009 renewals reflected modest improvement in market conditions as premium rates continued to stabilize across several lines of business and certain lines experienced rate increases. Overall, fourth quarter 2009 renewals reflected an aggregate price increase of 1% for the entire book. More specifically, premium rates increased approximately 2% in both the professional and the specie books of business, 1% in both casualty and offshore energy, and over 9% in the Companys aerospace book of business. Rates in both property and environmental were down in the low single digits. While the actions taken in 2009 have impacted both gross and net premiums written, the Companys decision to focus on those lines of business that provide the best return on capital was successfully implemented. In fact, indications from recent underwriting activity highlight that renewals from the Companys European book, where just less than 50% of the book renews on January 1, were strong across all product lines, particularly casualty, at 88%, and property, at 86%. Pricing based on the January 2010 renewals continued to show rate improvement with an aggregate rate increase of 1% compared to rate declines in January 2009 of minus 2%. Reinsurance Across the Reinsurance segment, initial indications, based on January 1, 2010 renewals, points to an increase in renewable premium of 6% with almost half of this increase being driven by recaptured business that was lost at the end of 2008 due to security concerns by customers. The reminder of the increase was through new business opportunities and increased catastrophe capacity in certain regions. However, there was a moderate decrease in premium rates across most major lines of business. Market rates are flat, with softening where loss activity was low in 2009. U.S. and non U.S. catastrophe exposed property lines experienced rate decreases of approximately 7.5% and 5.0% respectively, while other property lines in the U.S. were generally flat. While U.S. casualty rates, excluding D&O, were down slightly, casualty motor rates in Europe saw increases of up to 10% with rates in other casualty lines remaining flat. In addition, aviation and marine lines of business experienced rate increases of up to 10% whereas rates for the large property risks in Latin America continue to weaken. Looking ahead for the remainder of 2010, while the reinsurance market remains disciplined, the segment is impacted by the competitive conditions already outlined in the insurance segment above. The reinsurance segment will continue its philosophy of disciplined underwriting and will shrink the portfolio if market conditions do not warrant deploying capital. Investment Environment The Company seeks to generate revenue from investment activities through returns on its investment portfolio. The Companys current investment strategy seeks to support the liabilities arising from the operations of the Company, generate investment income and build book value over the longer term. 63 During the year ended December 31, 2009, financial market conditions continued to be extremely volatile, characterized by increasing long term global interest rates over the course of the year, combined with deterioration in credit markets early in the year, followed by rallies in credit markets in the latter half of the year. There was also significant quarter to quarter volatility during the year. The Companys results of operations and investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2009 were impacted by these trends. Net investment income yields were negatively impacted as a result of lower short term interest rates, particularly U.S. LIBOR, on floating rate assets, higher allocations to lower yielding government, agency and cash securities as a result of the Companys derisking efforts, and reduced prevailing yields on reinvestment income. Net realized losses resulted from sales transactions in relation to the Companys de risking efforts, and other than temporary impairment charges relating to the deterioration of future cash flow estimates, particularly in the non agency RMBS and medium term notes asset classes. Net unrealized losses for the Company declined as a result of both the mark to market impact of the credit rally during the year and the impact of realized losses on the year, offset by the effect of increasing interest rates. For further information, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Investment Activities Claims Environment The Companys profitability in any given period is based upon its premium and investment revenues as noted above, less net losses incurred and expenses. Net losses incurred are based upon claims paid and changes to unpaid loss reserves. Unpaid loss reserves are estimated by the Company and include both reported loss reserves and reserves for losses incurred but not reported, or IBNR. The Companys improved underwriting results for 2009 as compared to 2008 were largely due to minimal large loss activity in 2009 compared to the catastrophe and property risk losses experienced in 2008. In addition, included in the current year incurred losses was $284.7 million of net favorable prior year reserve development in various lines of business within the Companys Insurance and Reinsurance segments. In contrast, the Companys lower underwriting results for 2008 as compared to 2007 were largely a reflection of the increase in catastrophe and property risk losses experienced in 2008 offset by net favorable development of prior years reserves of $610.7 million. In addition, during 2007 and 2008, claims activity within the D&O and Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance markets overall, rose as a result of an increase in class action lawsuits filed against public companies due to market losses and related stock price depreciation associated with the sub prime mortgage and credit crisis in the U.S. This sub prime related claim activity decreased during 2009. Management actively monitors its potential exposure to potential clash events such as sub prime mortgage developments and gives due consideration to emerging claim trends in determining its loss reserve requirements at each quarter end. For further analysis of this exposure, see Results of Operations below. Results of Operations and Key Financial Measures The following table presents an analysis of the Companys net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and other financial measures (described below) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 206,607 $ (2,632,458 ) $ 206,375 Earnings (loss) per ordinary share basic $ 0.61 $ (10.94 ) $ 1.14 Earnings (loss) per ordinary share diluted $ 0.61 $ (10.94 ) $ 1.14 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents basic 340,612 240,657 180,353 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents diluted 340,966 240,657 181,209 64 The following are some of the financial measures management considers important in evaluating the Companys operating performance in the Companys property and casualty operations: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except ratios and per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 Underwriting profit property and casualty operations $ 327,306 $ 303,017 $ 723,939 Combined ratio property and casualty operations 93.6 % 94.9 % 88.8 % Net investment income property and casualty operations (1) $ 882,748 $ 1,174,856 $ 1,289,554 Book value per ordinary share $ 24.64 $ 15.46 $ 50.30 Fully diluted book value per ordinary share (2) $ 24.60 $ 15.46 $ 50.29 Return on average ordinary shareholders equity 3.1 % NM* 2.2 % (1) Net investment income relating to property and casualty operations does not include the net investment income related to the net results from structured products. (2) Fully diluted book value per ordinary share, a non GAAP measure, represents book value per ordinary share combined with the impact from dilution of share based compensation including in the money stock options at any period end. The Company believes that fully diluted book value per ordinary share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry. However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry. * NM Not Meaningful Key Financial Measures Underwriting profit property and casualty operations One way that the Company evaluates the performance of its insurance and reinsurance operations is the underwriting profit or loss. The Company does not measure performance based on the amount of gross premiums written. Underwriting profit or loss is calculated from premiums earned less net losses incurred and expenses related to underwriting activities. The Companys underwriting profit in the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily reflective of the combined ratio discussed below. Combined ratio property and casualty operations The combined ratio for property and casualty operations is used by the Company and many other insurance and reinsurance companies as another measure of underwriting profitability. The combined ratio is calculated from the net losses incurred and underwriting expenses as a ratio of the net premiums earned for the Companys insurance and reinsurance operations. A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit and greater than 100% reflects an underwriting loss. The Companys combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009, is slightly lower than the same period in the previous year, primarily as a result of a decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio, partially offset by an increase in the underwriting expense ratio. The loss and loss expense ratio has declined as a result of lower levels of catastrophe losses in both the insurance and reinsurance segments and lower current year professional lines losses in the insurance segment partially offset by larger prior year reserve releases reported in 2008. The increased underwriting expense ratio has been driven largely by increases in operating expenses against lower net premiums earned. Operating expenses increased mainly as a result of the Companys two restructuring activities as described further below. Going forward, with the two restructuring initiatives now essentially complete, we expect our targeted cost savings will be reflected in a lower 2010 expense ratio. The Companys combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008, was higher than the previous year, primarily as a result of an increase in the loss and loss expense ratio as well as the underwriting expense ratio. The higher loss and loss expense ratio resulted from higher current year attritional and catastrophe losses, primarily in property lines, combined with lower net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007, as a result of the continuing competitive underwriting environment and softening market conditions noted above. The higher 2008 loss ratio also results from a higher level of loss activity in professional lines due to the subprime and related credit crises. Partially offsetting the increase in incurred losses was higher favorable prior year reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2008. While acquisition expenses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007, the increase in operating expenses combined with the impact from the lower level of net premiums earned caused an increase in the underwriting expense ratio. 65 Net investment income property and casualty and corporate operations Net investment income related to property and casualty and corporate operations is an important measure that affects the Companys overall profitability. The largest liability of the Company relates to its unpaid loss reserves, and the Companys investment portfolio provides liquidity for claims settlements of these reserves as they become due. Thus, a significant part of the investment portfolio is invested in fixed income securities. Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates and credit spreads and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income related to property and casualty and corporate operations decreased by $398.6 million during 2009 as compared to same period in the prior year. Overall, portfolio yields have decreased as a result of the impact of declines in U.S. interest rates, and particularly the impact of decreased U.S. Dollar Libor on the Companys floating rate securities previously supporting the GIC and funding agreement business. In addition, the Company increased its holdings in lower yielding cash, government and agency RMBS securities in connection with its investment portfolio de risking efforts as the Company re aligns its portfolio to one more typical of a P&C portfolio and to increase liquidity. Net investment income related to property and casualty operations, excluding structured products, decreased by $114.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 2007. Overall, investment portfolio yields decreased in 2008 as yields earned on investment of cash flows and reinvestment of maturing or sold securities were generally lower than on securities previously held, as prevailing market interest rates, particularly in the U.S., decreased overall during 2008. The investment portfolio mix also changed as a result of the settlement of the GIC and funding agreement liabilities, as the property and casualty operations assumed a number of the floating rate securities previously held in the Companys Other Financial Lines segment and accordingly, net investment income is more sensitive to changes in short term interest rates. The Company also increased allocations to lower yielding cash, government and agency RMBS investments. Book value per ordinary share Management also views the change in the Companys book value per ordinary share as an additional measure of the Companys performance. Book value per share is calculated by dividing ordinary shareholders equity by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end. Book value per ordinary share is affected primarily by the Companys net income (loss), by any changes in the net unrealized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, currency translation adjustments and also the impact of any share repurchase or issuance activity. Book value per ordinary share increased by $9.14 in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to a decrease of $34.83 during 2008. During 2009, there was a decrease in net unrealized losses of $2.2 billion, net of tax. Although there was significant quarter to quarter volatility, in aggregate the impact of tightening credit spreads combined with the benefit from declining interest rates resulted in overall increased book value. Book value was further increased by the issuance of 11,461,080 shares issued at $65.00 per share upon the maturity of the purchase contracts associated with the 7.0% Equity Security Units, as such issuance was accretive to book value. In addition, book value per ordinary share increased as a result of net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of $206.6 million which included a $211.8 million gain associated with the purchase of a portion of the Companys Redeemable Series C Preference Ordinary Shares. Book value per ordinary share decreased by $34.83 in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to a decrease of $2.72 during 2007. The decrease in 2008 was primarily as a result of the Companys issuance of Class A ordinary shares issued at a discount to book value (as described below), the Companys net loss of $2.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008 and the increase in net unrealized losses on investments of approximately $2.9 billion, net of tax, during the same period. In addition, book value per ordinary share decreased as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $472.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. In August 2008, the Company issued 143.8 million Class A ordinary shares at a price of $16.00 per share, which was lower than the Companys book value per ordinary share at the time and thus dilutive. The Companys net loss of $2.6 billion was mainly due to the impact of the closing of the Master Agreement in August 2008 as described above, the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 of $990.0 million, catastrophe and attritional losses, as well as from 66 net realized losses on investments and losses from investment fund affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in net unrealized losses on investments of $2.2 billion, net of tax, during the year ended December 31, 2009 was mainly as a result of tightening credit spreads on corporate and structured credit assets and realized losses incurred during the year, offset by increases in prevailing government interest rates. As noted above, fully diluted book value per ordinary share represents book value per ordinary share combined with the impact from dilution of share based compensation including in the money stock options at any period end. Fully diluted book value per ordinary share increased by $9.14 and decreased by $34.83 during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a result of the factors noted above. Return on average ordinary shareholders equity Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE) is another financial measure that management considers important in evaluating the Companys operating performance. ROE is calculated by dividing the net income for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes minimum target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys minimum ROE targets over the longer term are not met with respect to any line of business, the Company seeks to modify and or exit these lines. In addition, among other factors, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is dependent on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance shareholder value as measured by ROE (adjusted for certain items considered to be non operating in nature). In 2009, ROE was 3.1%, significantly higher than the same period in the prior year when it was negative, mainly as a result of the closing of the Master Agreement in August 2008 as described above. Shareholders equity increased over the past twelve months mainly as a result of the decreases in unrealized losses on investments and favorable foreign exchange translation adjustments during this period. In 2008, ROE was negative, mainly as a result of the impact of the closing of the Master Agreement in August 2008 as described above, the goodwill impairment charge recorded in late 2008, as well as from catastrophe losses, net realized losses on investments and losses from the Companys investment fund affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2008. Significant Items Affecting the Results of Operations The Companys net income (loss) and other financial measures as shown above for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 have been affected by among other things, the following significant items: 1 ) impact of credit market movements in 2009, 2008 and 2007 on the Companys investment portfolio and investment fund affiliates; 2 ) impact of the closing of the Master Agreement (discussed below) in August 2008 and the impact in 2007 of the Companys investment in and relationships with Syncora; 3 ) continuing competitive underwriting environment; 4 ) net favorable prior year loss development; 5 ) impact of increased property risk and catastrophe activity in 2008 and limited property risk catastrophe activity in 2009 and 2007; 6 ) goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008; 7 ) redemption of a portion of the Companys Series C Preference Ordinary Shares; 8 ) impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges. 1. Impact of credit market movements in 2009, 2008 and 2007 on the Companys investment portfolio and investment fund affiliates During the year ended December 31, 2009, financial market conditions continued to be extremely volatile, characterized by increasing long term global interest rates over the course of the year, combined with deterioration in credit markets early in the year, followed by rallies in credit markets in the last three 67 quarters of the year. The net impact of the market conditions on the Companys investment portfolio for the year resulted in a decrease in net unrealized losses on available for sale investments as compared to December 31, 2008 of $2.1 billion. This represents approximately a 4.5% appreciation on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Net realized losses on investments in the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $921.4 million, included net realized losses of approximately $812.5 million related to the impairment of certain of the Companys fixed income, equity and other investments, where the Company determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments. For further analysis of this, see Results of Operations below. Of the $921.4 million, there was net realized losses of $406.6 million related to credit impairments on structured credit securities. Primarily these represented below investment grade non Agency RMBS, including those with sub prime and Alt A collateral. A further $226.9 million in net realized losses related to impairments of medium term notes backed primarily by investment grade European credit and $160.6 million of impairments related primarily to the intent to sell certain Tier One and Upper Tier Two securities. The remaining impairment during the year was spread across the investment portfolio including equities and other fixed income investments. Consistent with prior years, management continues to evaluate the impairment of the investment portfolio and satisfy itself that the remaining gross unrealized losses are temporary in nature. 2. Impact of the closing of the Master Agreement in August 2008 and the impact in 2007 of the Companys investment in and relationships with Syncora On July 28, 2008, the Company announced that it and certain of its subsidiaries had entered into an agreement (the Master Agreement) with Syncora and certain of its subsidiaries (sometimes collectively referred to herein as Syncora) as well as certain counterparties to credit default swap agreements (the Counterparties), in connection with the termination of certain reinsurance and other agreements. The transactions and termination of certain reinsurance and other agreements under the Master Agreement closed on August 5, 2008. For a description of the Master Agreement, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Syncora Holdings Ltd. (Syncora). After the closing of the Master Agreement on August 5, 2008, approximately $64.6 billion of the Companys total net exposure (which was $65.7 billion as at June 30, 2008) under reinsurance agreements and guarantees with Syncora subsidiaries was eliminated. Pursuant to the terms of the Master Agreement, Syncora is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commute the agreements that are the subject of the Companys guarantee of Syncora Guarantees obligations under certain financial guarantees issued by Syncora Guarantee to the European Investment Bank (the EIB Policies), subject to certain limitations. As at December 31, 2009, the Companys exposure relating to the EIB Policies (which relate to project finance transactions) was approximately $920.4 million as compared to $955.4 million at December 31, 2008, decreasing mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of the underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2009, there had been no reported events of default on the underlying obligations. Accordingly, no reserves have been recorded. 68 The terms of the Master Agreement were agreed in consideration of a number of commercial and economic factors associated with all existing relationships with Syncora, including, but not limited to, a valuation of the consideration for the commuted agreements and any potential future claims there under and the impact of outstanding uncertainty on both the ratings and business operations of the Company. The total value of the consideration noted above of $1.775 billion as well as the eight million ordinary shares of the Company transferred to Syncora valued at $128.0 million, significantly exceeded the carried net liabilities of approximately $490.7 million related to such reinsurances and guarantees. Management considers the execution of the Master Agreement as the event giving rise to the additional liability. As detailed in the table below, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $1.4 billion in respect of the closing of the Master Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2008: (U.S. dollars in millions) Carried liabilities in relation to reinsurance and guarantee agreements commuted under the Master Agreement $ 490.7 Other accruals (5.2 ) Cash payment made to Syncora in August 2008 (1,775.0 ) Value of XL common shares transferred under the Master Agreement (128.0 ) Net loss associated with Master Agreement recorded in the year ended December 31, 2008 $ (1,417.5 ) Given managements view of the risk exposure along with the uncertainty facing the entire financial guarantee industry in the latter part of 2007, the Company reduced the reported value of its investment in Syncora to nil at December 31, 2007, from the reported equity method value of $669.8 million as at September 30, 2007. In addition, net losses were recorded in 2007 within loss from operating affiliates with respect to the previous excess of loss and facultative reinsurance of Syncora subsidiaries in the amounts of $300.0 million and $51.0 million, respectively. In addition, during 2007, the Company incurred $17.9 million in additional mark to market losses related to those underlying contracts in credit default swap form subject to the provisions noted above. 3. Continuing competitive underwriting environment Soft market conditions were experienced across most lines of business throughout 2007, 2008 and 2009, resulting in an overall decrease in gross and net premiums written. For further information in relation to the underwriting environment, including details relating to rates and retention, see Executive Overview Underwriting Environment, above. 4. Net favorable prior year loss development Net favorable prior year loss development occurs when there is a decrease to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prior years that is less than expected loss development. Net prior year adverse loss development occurs when there is an increase to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prior years exceeding expected loss development. The following table presents the net (favorable) adverse prior year loss development of the Companys loss and loss expense reserves for its property and casualty operations which include the Insurance and Reinsurance segments for each of the years indicated: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Insurance segment $ (62.9 ) $ (305.5 ) $ (158.1 ) Reinsurance segment (221.8 ) (305.2 ) (267.3 ) Total $ (284.7 ) $ (610.7 ) $ (425.4 ) During 2009, net favorable prior year development totaled $284.7 million in the Companys property and casualty operations and included net favorable development in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments of $62.9 million and $221.8 million, respectively. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Losses and Loss Expenses, for further information regarding the developments in prior year loss reserve estimates for each of the years indicated within each of the Companys operating segments. 69 5. Impact of increased property risk and catastrophe activity in 2008 and limited property risk and catastrophe activity in 2009 and 2007 Current year net losses in 2009 decreased by $794.1 million over 2008, primarily due to lower levels of large property risk and catastrophe losses occurring in the current year as compared to 2008. On September 1, 2008, Hurricane Gustav hit the Louisiana coast of the U.S. as a Category 2 hurricane, causing considerable damage to insured property and loss of life. On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike made landfall near Galveston, Texas as a strong Category 2 hurricane, causing significantly more damage and loss of life than Hurricane Gustav. Hurricane Ike was the third costliest hurricane to ever make landfall in the U.S. In 2008, the Company incurred losses, net of reinsurance recoveries and reinstatement premiums, of $22.5 million and $210.0 million related to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, respectively. In addition to natural peril catastrophes, there was also an increase in large property risk losses globally during 2008 that contributed to higher loss ratios in both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Overall, 2009 and 2007 experienced a lower number of natural catastrophes as compared to 2008. In 2009, natural catastrophes included Hailstorm Wolfgang, Japanese earthquake, Windstorm Klaus, Typhoon Ketsana, Asian earthquake and tsunami and Australian wildfires. In 2007, six hurricanes formed in the Atlantic region including two Category 5 hurricanes, while other natural catastrophes in 2007 included European windstorms Kyrill and Per/Hanno, California wildfires, floods in the U.K. and Mexico, the Peruvian earthquake and five hurricanes in the Eastern Pacific region. 6. Goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2008 Due to the financial market and economic events that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test for goodwill subsequent to its annual testing date of June 30. The interim impairment test resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $990.0 million. The charge relates primarily to certain reinsurance unit goodwill associated with the merger of Mid Ocean Limited (Mid Ocean) in 1998. The fair value of the Mid Ocean reporting unit was calculated using the methodologies as described within Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below, and by comparison with similar companies using their publicly traded price multiples as the basis for valuation. For further information, see Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and see further discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 7. Redemption of a portion of the Companys Series C Preference Ordinary Shares On March 26, 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding Series C Preference Ordinary Shares that resulted in approximately 12.7 million Series C Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation value of $317.3 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $104.7 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, combined with professional fees totaling $0.8 million. As a result, a book value gain to ordinary shareholders equity of approximately $211.8 million was recorded. Subsequent to December 31, 2009 the Company repurchased 4.4 million Series C Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation value of $110.8 million for approximately $94.2 million. 8. Restructuring and asset impairment charges During the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, expense reduction initiatives were implemented in order to reduce the Companys operating expenses. The goal of these initiatives was to achieve enhanced efficiency and an overall reduction in operating expenses by streamlining processes across all geographic locations, with a primary emphasis on corporate functions. To date, this has been achieved through reductions in redundancies, increased outsourcing and the cessation of certain projects and activities. Charges have been recognized and accrued as restructuring and asset impairment charges and allocated to the Companys reportable segments in accordance with authoritative guidance over accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and guidance over accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Other costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual are being expensed as restructuring charges as they are incurred. Restructuring charges relate mainly to employee termination benefits as well as costs associated with ceasing to use certain leased property accounted for as operating leases. Asset impairment charges relate primarily to the write off of certain IT system and equipment costs 70 previously capitalized. The Company recognizes an asset impairment charge when net proceeds expected from disposition of an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset and reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 costs incurred in relation to the restructuring and asset impairment charges noted above are $81.5 million and $50.8 million, respectively. These charges have been recorded in the Companys income statement under Operating Expenses. See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges, for further information regarding the actual and expected costs for each of the years indicated within each of the Companys operating segments. Other Key Focuses of Management Throughout the latter part of 2008 and 2009 and into 2010, the Company remains focused on, among other things, simplifying the Companys business model to focus on core property and casualty business and enhancing its enterprise risk management capabilities. Details relating to these initiatives are highlighted below. Simplify the Companys Business Model and Enhance Risk Management In relation to this top management priority, certain initiatives that have taken place or are underway include the following: Focus on P&C Businesses: As previously announced, the Company is focusing on those lines of business within its Insurance and Reinsurance segments that provide the best return on capital. As such, the Company will continue to be highly selective on new business, emphasize short tail lines, where applicable, in the Companys Reinsurance segment, exit other businesses (e.g., Casualty facultative business), non renew certain insurance programs. In addition, in December 2008 the Company completed a strategic review of its Life reinsurance business. In connection therewith, the Company announced that it sold renewal rights to a portion of its European life, accident and health reinsurance business, a relatively small block of business, and it will run off its existing book of U.K. and Irish life and annuity business. In addition, during December 2009, the Company sold its U.S. life reinsurance business. Enterprise Risk Management: The Company is focused on enhancing its risk management capabilities throughout all facets of its operations. This initiative is led by the Companys Chief Enterprise Risk Officer (CERO) and is supported by, among others, the Companys ERC comprised of the most senior risk management executives of the Company. The ERM Committee will continue to assist with the efficient identification, assessment, monitoring and reporting of key risks across the Company. See Item 1, Business Enterprise Risk Management for further information. Simplify P&C Investment Portfolio: The Company has continued to reposition the Companys P&C investment portfolio to one that supports a P&C focused operation so that a) book value volatility, particularly related to credit spreads arising from the investment portfolio, is reduced, b) a reduction in lower rated corporate securities and financial issuers is achieved, c) exposure to commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) is reduced and d) a reduction in asset classes such as sub prime, Alt A and Core collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) previously supporting the guaranteed investment contract and funding agreement businesses is achieved. The Company estimates that its derisking efforts within the P&C investment portfolio are now approximately 80% complete in terms of the potential mark to market that would arise from a repeat of the credit crisis of January 2007 to March 2009. The estimated mark to market represents estimated modeled portfolio level results, rather than individual security level results. Although the actual P&C investment portfolio lost approximately $4.0 billion of mark to market over this period, it is estimated that the P&C investment portfolio, as structured at December 31, 2009, would have lost $1.6 billion over this period. The Companys target P&C SAA benchmark would have lost approximately $1.0 billion over the same period. As a result of this progress, the Company will now focus on optimizing the P&C investment portfolio, as compared to its previous focus on pure de risking. Accordingly, the remaining positions in legacy asset classes such as Agency RMBS and 71 Core CDOs are most likely to be reduced through natural bond maturities and opportunistic sales based on underlying fundamentals and economics. In conjunction with its risk reduction exercise, management executed targeted sales of certain assets and completed the sales of $1.5 billion of assets associated with the restructuring charge announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. The sales concentrated in certain holdings within the Companys BBB and lower corporate, CMBS, equity and consumer ABS portfolios. Consistent with this strategy, management continued the process of reducing risk in the investment portfolio during 2009. As a result of these sales, and additional derisking steps executed over the course of 2009, the Company reduced its exposures to more volatile asset classes. Management reduced the aggregate CMBS and non Agency US RMBS (includes sub prime, Alt A, second lien, ABS CDOs, and Prime assets) portfolio holdings significantly, through maturities and paydowns and certain opportunistic sales by $2.2 billion during 2009 ($4.6 billion cumulatively since 2008), in particular $1.4 billion in the CMBS portfolio. As well, the aggregate corporate portfolio was reduced by $1.8 billion during 2009 ($2.9 billion cumulatively since 2008). The Company reduced its exposure to alternative investments by approximately $0.4 billion during 2009 ($1.3 billion cumulatively since 2008), and its exposure to equities by $0.3 billion during 2009 ($0.5 billion cumulatively since the beginning of 2008) in response to adverse market conditions and in regards to the risk reduction exercise ongoing within its investment portfolio. Management further reduced interest rate risk exposure in 2009 by shortening the duration of the investment portfolio supporting the U.S. property and casualty segment operations, excluding structured products by 0.3 years (from 3.2 to 2.9). Cash, government and agency holdings and government backed or guaranteed holdings were increased to approximately $18.9 billion representing approximately 55.8% of the aggregate fixed income portfolio at December 31, 2009 as compared to $13.3 billion or 42% of the portfolio at December 31, 2008. Simplify Life Investment Portfolio: Within its Life operations, management also took measures to reduce exposure to certain more volatile asset classes. Management reduced overall exposure to hybrid bank capital securities by $126.0 million and reinvested those proceeds in higher quality issues. In addition, management also reduced exposure to $51.0 million of other investment grade and below investment grade securities as market opportunities presented. While the Company seeks to reduce the overall risk within its P&C and Life investment portfolios, it will continue to attempt to balance investment returns against market and credit risks taken. Market risk may arise due to interest rate variability and exposure to foreign denominated currencies, which the Company seeks to manage through asset/liability management, and due to the allocation to non fixed income assets, including global equity securities and alternative investments, which the Company seeks to manage through diversification. Credit risk arises from investments in fixed income securities and is managed with aggregate and portfolio limits and by establishing minimum credit quality guidelines. The Company guidelines require a minimum Aa3/AA weighted average rating for its fixed income portfolio. Capital Management Fundamental to supporting the Companys business model is its ability to underwrite business, which is largely dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. As a result, in the event that the Company is further downgraded, its ability to write business as well as its financial condition and or results of operations, could be materially adversely affected. See Item 1, Business Ratings for further information regarding recent rating actions by the various rating agencies, as well as details regarding the Companys financial strength and debt ratings. 72 In relation to the Companys capital position, several activities occurred throughout 2008 and early 2009, including the following: In order to fund payments under the Master Agreement described above, in August 2008, the Company raised approximately $2.8 billion of additional capital through an issuance of both ordinary shares and equity security units (the ESUs). The ESUs consist of: (i) forward purchase contracts to purchase, and the Company to issue, its ordinary shares and (ii) debt securities. For further details relating to the Master Agreement, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Syncora Holdings Ltd. (Syncora). In addition to the payments to Syncora, the Company used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, and the redemption of X.L. America, Inc.s $255 million 6.58% Guaranteed Senior Notes due April 2011 (the 6.58% Notes) and capital funding of certain of the Companys subsidiaries. Concurrent with the closing of the Master Agreement, the Company exercised the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility entered into in July 2003 resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $500.0 million in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 20,000,000 Series C Preference Ordinary Shares. See Capital Resources below for further details relating to the Series C Preference Ordinary Shares. In July 2008, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.19 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in September 2008. Following the settlement of the purchase contracts associated with the 7.0% ESUs in February 2009, the Company issued 11,461,080 Shares for net proceeds of approximately $743.1 million, which was used to retire the senior notes previously due February 2011 which had a fixed coupon of 5.25% (the 2011 Senior Notes). In February 2009, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.10 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in March 2009. On March 26, 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding Series C Preference Ordinary Shares that resulted in approximately 12.7 million Series C Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation value of $317.3 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $104.7 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, combined with professional fees totaling $0.8 million. As a result, a book value gain of approximately $211.8 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 to ordinary shareholders. Other capital management initiatives undertaken in 2008 and 2009 included the following: Upon expiration of the Companys quota share reinsurance treaty with Cyrus Re which reduced the Companys catastrophe exposures, the Company, effective January 1, 2008, entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty with a newly formed Bermuda reinsurance company, Cyrus Re II. Pursuant to the terms of the quota share reinsurance treaty, Cyrus Re II assumed a 10% cession of certain lines of property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocession business underwritten by certain operating subsidiaries of the Company for business that incepted between January 1, 2008 and July 1, 2008. In connection with such cessions, the Company paid Cyrus Re II reinsurance premium less a ceding commission, which included a reimbursement of direct acquisition expenses incurred by the Company as well as a commission to the Company for generating the business. The quota share reinsurance treaty also provided for a profit commission payable to the Company. Cyrus Re II was canceled and not renewed at December 31, 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company purchased additional reinsurance including several tranches of industry loss warranty contracts attaching at various levels. Such industry loss warranty contracts were short term in nature and are not considered to be a permanent component of the Companys long term risk management strategy. In relation to catastrophe risk management, the Company considers the loss of capital due to a single large event and the loss of capital that would occur from multiple (but potentially smaller) events in any given year. The Company imposes a limit to catastrophe risk from any single loss in a given region/peril at a 1% exceedance probability. 73 The Company manages its limits to a catastrophe risk from a single loss in a given peril/region at a 1% exceedance probability. Tier 1 limits which include natural catastrophes and other realistic disaster scenarios are targeted at a level not to exceed 15% of tangible shareholders equity, where Tier 2 limits, which include pandemic, longevity and country risk, are established at no more than half of Tier 1 limits. These target limits are established by a combination of commercially available models, internally developed probable maximum loss estimates and the judgment of management. Subsequent to December 31, 2009 the Company repurchased 4.4 million Series C Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation value of $110.8 million for approximately $94.2 million. Proposed Redomestication to Ireland from The Cayman Islands On January 12, 2010 the Company announced that it proposes to change the parent holding companys place of incorporation to Ireland from the Cayman Islands, with the parent holding company to be renamed XL Group plc. To effect the redomestication, a new Irish public limited company, XL Group plc, would replace XL Capital Ltd as the ultimate holding company of the XL group of companies, and the Companys ordinary shareholders would receive one ordinary share of the new Irish company in lieu of each ordinary share of the Company held by them. The Company intends to submit the proposal for redomestication, along with related proposals, to its shareholders and complete the transaction on July 1, 2010. The proposed redomestication will be subject to approval by the Companys ordinary shareholders and the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, as well as satisfaction of other conditions. The company has operated in Ireland for most of its corporate history and is very familiar with its regulatory and legal environment. Ireland has strong international relationships as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development (OECD) and the European Union, a long history of international investment, and long established commercial relationships, trade agreements and tax treaties with the other European Union member states, the United States and other countries around the world. As a result, the Company believes Ireland offers a stable long term legal and regulatory environment with the financial sophistication to meet the needs of XLs global business. The Company does not expect the redomestication will have any material impact on its financial results. The Company will continue to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and be subject to SEC reporting requirements. Further, the Company will continue to be subject to the mandates of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and will continue to report its financial results in U.S. dollars and under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, in addition to any reporting requirements under Irish law. The Companys shares will continue to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol XL. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The following are considered to be the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates due to the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and or the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions or estimates applied for any or all of the accounting policies (either individually or in the aggregate), there could be a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Other significant accounting policies are nevertheless important to an understanding of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Policies such as those related to revenue recognition, financial instruments and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies. 1) Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses and Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses Recoverable As the Company earns premiums for the underwriting risks it assumes, it also establishes an estimate of the expected ultimate losses related to the premium. Loss reserves or unpaid loss and loss expenses are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and 74 settlement of a loss. The process of establishing reserves for unpaid property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability, as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. Loss reserves include: a) Case reserves reserves for reported losses and loss expenses that have not yet been settled; and b) IBNR losses reserves for incurred but not reported losses or for reported losses over and above the amount of case reserves. Case reserves for the Companys property and casualty operations are established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies and consultation with legal counsel, and represent the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among the Companys operations. With respect to the Companys insurance operations, the Company is notified of insured losses and records a case reserve for the estimated amount of the settlement, if any. The estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of legal counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. With respect to the Companys reinsurance operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the estimated ultimate cost of a loss. The uncertainty in the reserving process for reinsurers is due, in part, to the time lags inherent in reporting from the original claimant to the primary insurer to the reinsurer. As a predominantly broker market reinsurer for both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the Company is subject to a potential additional time lag in the receipt of information as the primary insurer reports to the broker who in turn reports to the Company. As of December 31, 2009, the Company did not have any significant backlog related to its processing of assumed reinsurance information. Since the Company relies on information regarding paid losses, case reserves and IBNR provided by ceding companies in order to assist it in estimating its liability for unpaid losses and LAE, the Company maintains certain procedures in order to help determine the completeness and accuracy of such information. Periodically, management assesses the reporting activities of its ceding companies on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria. In addition to conferring with ceding companies or brokers on claims matters, the Companys claims personnel conduct periodic audits of specific claims and the overall claims procedures of its ceding companies at their offices. The Company relies on its ability to effectively monitor the claims handling and claims reserving practices of ceding companies in order to help establish the proper reinsurance premium for reinsurance agreements and to establish proper loss reserves. Disputes with ceding companies have been rare and generally have been resolved through negotiation. As noted above, case reserves for the Companys reinsurance operations are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the Companys estimated ultimate cost of a loss. In addition to information received from ceding companies on reported claims, the Company also utilizes information on the pattern of ceding company loss reporting and loss settlements from previous catastrophic events in order to estimate the Companys ultimate liability related to catastrophic events such as hurricanes. Commercial catastrophe model analyses and zonal aggregate exposures are utilized to assess potential client loss before and after an event. Initial cedant loss reports are generally obtained shortly after a catastrophic event, with subsequent updates received as new information becomes available. The Company actively requests loss updates from cedants periodically for the first year following an event. The Companys claim settlement processes also incorporate an update to the total loss reserve at the time a claim payment is made to a ceding company. While the reliance on loss reports from ceding companies may increase the level of uncertainty associated with the estimation of total loss reserves for property reinsurance relative to direct property insurance, there are several factors which serve to reduce the uncertainty in loss reserve estimates for property reinsurance. First, for large natural catastrophe events, aggregate limits in property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally fully exhausted by the loss reserve estimates. Second, as a reinsurer, the 75 Company has access to information from a broad cross section of the insurance industry. The Company utilizes such information in order to perform consistency checks on the data provided by ceding companies and is able to identify trends in loss reporting and settlement activity and incorporate such information in its estimate of IBNR reserves. Finally, the Company also supplements the loss information received from cedants with loss estimates developed by market share techniques and or from third party catastrophe models applied to exposure data supplied by cedants. IBNR reserves represent managements best estimate, at a given point in time, of the amount in excess of case reserves that is needed for the future settlement and loss adjustment costs associated with claims incurred. It is possible that the ultimate liability may differ materially from these estimates. Because the ultimate amount of unpaid losses and LAE is uncertain, the Company believes that quantitative techniques to estimate these amounts are enhanced by professional and managerial judgment. Management reviews the IBNR estimates produced by the Companys actuaries and determines its best estimate of the liabilities to record in the Companys financial statements. The Company considers this single point estimate to be the mean expected outcome. IBNR reserves are estimated by the Companys actuaries using several standard actuarial methodologies including the loss ratio method, the loss development or chain ladder method, the Bornhuetter Ferguson (BF) method and frequency and severity approaches. IBNR related to a specific event may be based on the Companys estimated exposure to an industry loss and may include the use of catastrophe modeling software. On a quarterly basis, IBNR reserves are reviewed by the Companys actuaries, and are adjusted as new information becomes available. Any such adjustments are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which they are made. The Companys actuaries utilize one set of assumptions in determining its single point estimate, which includes actual loss data, loss development factors, loss ratios, reported claim frequency and severity. The actuarial reviews and documentation are completed in accordance with professional actuarial standards with reserves established on a basis consistent with US GAAP. The selected assumptions reflect the actuarys judgment based on historical data and experience combined with information concerning current underwriting, economic, judicial, regulatory and other influences on ultimate claim settlements. When estimating IBNR reserves, each of the Companys insurance and reinsurance business units segregate business into exposure classes (over 150 classes are reviewed in total). Within each class, the business is further segregated by either the year in which the contract incepted (underwriting year), the year in which the claim occurred (accident year), or the year in which the claim is reported (report year). The majority of the Insurance segment is reviewed on an accident year basis. Professional lines insurance business is reviewed on a report year basis due to the claims made nature of the underlying policies. The majority of the Reinsurance segment is reviewed on an underwriting year basis. Generally, initial actuarial estimates of IBNR reserves not related to a specific event are based on the loss ratio method applied to each class of business. Actual paid losses and case reserves (reported losses) are subtracted from expected ultimate losses to determine IBNR reserves. The initial expected ultimate losses involve management judgment and are based on historical information for that class of business; which includes loss ratios, market conditions, changes in pricing and conditions, underwriting changes, changes in claims emergence, and other factors that may influence expected ultimate losses. Over time, as a greater number of claims are reported, actuarial estimates of IBNR are based on the BF and loss development techniques. The BF method utilizes actual loss data and the expected patterns of loss emergence, combined with an initial expectation of ultimate losses to determine an estimate of ultimate losses. This method may be appropriate when there is limited actual loss data and a relatively less stable pattern of loss emergence. The chain ladder method utilizes actual loss and expected patterns of loss emergence to determine an estimate of ultimate losses that is independent of the initial expectation of ultimate losses. This method may be appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss emergence and a relatively larger number of reported claims. Multiple estimates of ultimate losses using a variety of actuarial methods are calculated for each of the Companys (150+) classes of business for each year of loss experience. The Companys actuaries look at each class and determine the most appropriate point estimate based on the characteristics of the particular class and other relevant factors, such as historical ultimate loss ratios, the presence of individual large losses, and known occurrences that have not yet resulted in reported 76 losses. Once the Companys actuaries make their determination of the most appropriate point estimate for each class, this information is aggregated and presented to management for review and approval. The pattern of loss emergence is determined using actuarial analysis, including judgment, and is based on the historical patterns of the recording of paid and reported losses by the Company, as well as industry information. Information that may cause historical patterns to differ from future patterns is considered and reflected in expected patterns as appropriate. For property, marine and aviation insurance, losses are generally reported within 2 to 3 years from the beginning of the accident year. For casualty insurance, loss emergence patterns can vary from 3 years to over 20 years depending on the type of business. For other insurance, loss emergence patterns fall between the property and casualty insurance. For reinsurance business, loss reporting lags the corresponding insurance classes by at least one quarter due to the need for loss information to flow from the ceding companies to the Company generally via reinsurance intermediaries. Such lags in loss reporting are reflected in the actuarys selections of loss reporting patterns used in establishing the Companys reserves. Such estimates are not precise because, among other things, they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity, claim frequency, and other issues. In the process of estimating IBNR reserves, provisions for economic inflation and changes in the social and legal environment are considered, but involve considerable judgment. When estimating IBNR reserves, more judgement is typically required for lines of business with longer loss emergence patterns. Due to the low frequency and high severity nature of some of the business underwritten by the Company, the Companys reserve estimates are highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment and are therefore uncertain. In property classes, there can be additional uncertainty in loss estimation related to large catastrophe events. With wind events, such as hurricanes, the damage assessment process may take more than a year. The cost of claims is subject to volatility due to supply shortages for construction materials and labor. In the case of earthquakes, the damage assessment process may take several years as buildings are discovered to have structural weaknesses not initially detected. The uncertainty inherent in IBNR reserve estimates is particularly pronounced for casualty coverages, such as excess liability, professional liability coverages, and workers compensation, where information emerges relatively slowly over time. The Companys three types of property and casualty reserve exposure with the longest tails are: (1) high layer excess casualty insurance; (2) casualty reinsurance; and (3) discontinued asbestos and long tail environmental business. Certain aspects of the Companys casualty operations complicate the actuarial process for establishing reserves. Certain casualty business written by the Companys insurance operations is high layer excess casualty business, meaning that the Companys liability attaches after large deductibles including self insurance or insurance from sources other than the Company. The Company commenced writing this type of business in 1986 and issued policies in forms that were different from traditional policies used by the industry at that time. Initially, there was a lack of industry data available for this type of business. Consequently, the basis for establishing loss reserves by the Company for this type of business was largely judgmental and based upon the Companys own reported loss experience which was used as a basis for determining ultimate losses, and therefore IBNR reserves. Over time, the amount of available historical loss experience data has increased. As a result, the Company has obtained a larger statistical base to assist in establishing reserves for these excess casualty insurance claims. High layer excess casualty insurance claims typically involve claims relating to (i) a shock loss such as an explosion or transportation accident causing severe damage to persons and or property over a short period of time, (ii) a non shock loss where a large number of claimants are exposed to injurious conditions over a longer period of time, such as exposure to chemicals or pharmaceuticals or (iii) a professional liability loss such as a medical malpractice claim. In each case, these claims are ultimately settled following extensive negotiations and legal proceedings. This process typically takes 5 to 15 years following the date of loss. Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications to the reserving process, particularly for casualty business written, in that there is an inherent lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event 77 from an insured or ceding company to the reinsurer. This reporting lag creates an even longer period of time between the policy inception and when a claim is finally settled. As a result, more judgment is required to establish reserves for ultimate claims in the Companys reinsurance operations. In the Companys reinsurance operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the Companys estimated ultimate cost of a loss. Casualty reinsurance business involves reserving methods that generally include historical aggregated claim information as reported by ceding companies, combined with the results of claims and underwriting reviews of a sample of the ceding companys claims and underwriting files. Therefore, the Company does not always receive detailed claim information for this line of business. Discontinued asbestos and long tail environment business had been previously written by NAC Re Corp. (now known as XL Reinsurance America Inc.), prior to its acquisition by the Company. As at December 31, 2009, total gross unpaid losses and loss expenses in respect of this business represented less than 1% of unpaid losses and loss expenses. Except for certain workers compensation liabilities (including long term disability), the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving for workers compensation unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable. For further discussion see the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loss and loss expenses are charged to income as they are incurred. These charges include loss and loss expense payments and any changes in case and IBNR reserves. During the loss settlement period, additional facts regarding claims are reported. As these additional facts are reported, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the unpaid losses and loss expense reserves. The actual final liability may be significantly different than prior estimates. The Companys net unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to the Companys operating segments at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows: (U.S. dollars in millions) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Insurance $ 11,128 $ 11,126 Reinsurance 6,138 6,559 Net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves $ 17,266 $ 17,685 (U.S. dollars in millions) Net Unpaid Losses and Loss Expensesas at December 31, 2009 CaseReserves IBNRReserves TotalReserves Insurance Casualty professional lines. $ 1,443 2,962 4,405 Casualty other lines 1,529 2,329 3,858 Property 340 76 416 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 578 492 1,070 Other specialty lines (2) 351 582 933 Other (3) 251 138 389 Structured indemnity (8 ) 65 57 Total $ 4,484 6,644 11,128 Reinsurance Casualty (4) $ 1,723 2,321 4,044 Property catastrophe (1) 111 140 251 Other property 396 417 813 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 439 35 474 Other (3) 233 262 495 Structured indemnity 61 61 Total $ 2,902 3,236 6,138 TOTAL $ 7,386 9,880 17,266 78 (U.S. dollars in millions) Net Unpaid Losses and Loss Expensesas at December 31, 2008 CaseReserves IBNRReserves TotalReserves Insurance Casualty professional lines $ 1,558 $ 2,764 $ 4,322 Casualty other lines 1,551 2,190 3,741 Property 491 133 624 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 635 534 1,169 Other specialty lines (2) 341 500 841 Other (3) 233 146 379 Structured indemnity (7 ) 57 50 Total $ 4,802 $ 6,324 $ 11,126 Reinsurance Casualty (4) $ 1,715 $ 2,427 $ 4,142 Property catastrophe (1) 157 148 305 Other property 535 427 962 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 443 72 515 Other (3) 256 301 557 Structured indemnity 78 78 Total $ 3,106 $ 3,453 $ 6,559 TOTAL $ 7,908 $ 9,777 $ 17,685 (1) Property catastrophe IBNR includes event specific reserves for losses that the Companys insureds and cedants have informed the Company they expect to incur but have not yet had reported known claims. (2) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, specie, middle markets and excess and surplus lines. (3) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. (4) Within the Reinsurance segment, casualty other and casualty professional lines of business are shown in the aggregate. As noted above, management reviews the IBNR estimates produced by the Companys actuaries and determines its best estimate of the liabilities to record in the Companys financial statements. The Company considers this single point estimate to be the mean expected outcome. Management believes that the actuarial methods utilized adequately provide for loss development. Management does not build in a provision for uncertainty outside of the estimates prepared by the Companys actuaries. While the proportion of unpaid losses and loss expenses represented by IBNR is sensitive to a number of factors, the most significant ones have historically been accelerated business growth and changes in business mix. Other factors that have affected the ratio in the past include additions to prior period reserves, catastrophic occurrences, settlement of large claims and changes in claims settlement patterns. The ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased in recent years due to the growth of casualty and professional business written over that period. The ratio of IBNR to total reserves is higher for more recent years business because these immature years have relatively fewer claims reported and, as a result, a higher proportion of claims reserves are based on experience in respect of incurred but not reported losses. As each prior year of business matures and claims become known, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. Since the Company has experienced premium volume growth in recent years, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased because the Companys aggregate exposure has become relatively less mature. Conversely, in a situation of declining premium volume, this ratio will typically decline, all other factors remaining constant. The Company writes insurance and reinsurance business in many different lines. Typically, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves is greater for casualty (including professional) lines (which are longer tail in nature) than for property lines due to the policy forms utilized and timing of loss reporting. In recent years, casualty lines have increased as a proportion of the Companys business when compared to property lines (which are shorter tail in nature). 79 IBNR reserves are calculated by the Companys actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies as discussed above. Since the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company adopted a methodology that provides a single point reserve estimate separately for each line of business and also a range of possible outcomes across each single point reserve estimate. This is discussed further below. The following table shows the recorded estimate and the high and low ends of the range of the Companys net unpaid losses and loss expenses for each of the lines of business noted above at December 31, 2009: (U.S. dollars in millions) Net UnpaidLosses and LossExpensesRecorded as atDecember 31, 2009 Range of NetUnpaid Losses &Loss ExpensesEstimated as atDecember 31,2009 Range of NetUnpaid Losses &Loss ExpensesEstimated as atDecember 31,2009 High Low Insurance Casualty professional lines $ 4,405 $ 4,921 $ 3,913 Casualty other lines. 3,858 4,344 3,394 Property 416 462 373 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite. 1,070 1,183 962 Other specialty lines (2) 933 1,020 848 Other (3) 389 448 333 Total (5) $ 11,071 $ 12,071 $ 10,106 Reinsurance Casualty (4) $ 4,044 $ 4,446 $ 3,674 Property catastrophe (1). 251 317 192 Other property 813 915 718 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite. 474 537 416 Other (3) 495 567 431 Total (5) $ 6,077 $ 6,584 $ 5,604 Structured Indemnity (5) $ 118 Total $ 17,266 (1) Property catastrophe IBNR includes event specific reserves for losses that the Companys insureds and cedants have informed it they expect to incur but have not yet had reported known claims. (2) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, and excess and surplus lines. (3) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. (4) Within the Reinsurance segment, casualty other and casualty professional lines of business are shown in the aggregate. (5) The range for the total Insurance and Reinsurance segment reserves is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business shown in the table due to diversification benefits across the lines of business. In addition, the total for each of the Insurance and Reinsurance segments does not include reserves relating to structured indemnity business as the Company does not develop reserve ranges for this line of business. Actual development of recorded reserves as of December 31, 2008 during 2009 was within the estimated reserve range. There are factors that would cause reserves to increase or decrease within the context of the range provided. The magnitude of any change in ultimate losses would be determined by the magnitude of any changes to the Companys assumptions or combined impact of changes in assumptions. Factors that would increase reserves include, but are not limited to, increases in claim severity, increases in expected level of reported claims, changes to the regulatory environment which expand the exposure insured by the Company, changes in the litigation environment that increase claim awards, filings or verdicts, unexpected increases in loss inflation, and or new types of claims being pursued against the Company. Factors that would decrease reserves include, but are not limited to, decreases in claim severity, reductions in the expected level of reported claims, changes to the regulatory environment which contract the exposure 80 insured by the Company, changes in the litigation environment that decrease claim awards, filings or verdicts, and or unexpected decreases in loss inflation. The Companys methodology in 2009 for calculating reserve ranges around its single point reserve estimate is consistent with that used in 2008. The Company modeled a statistical distribution of potential reserve outcomes over a one year run off period for each of the approximately 35 lines of business. In doing so the Company evaluated a number of alternative models, and for each line of business the Companys actuaries selected the distribution parameters deemed to be most appropriate. Factors affecting this decision included an assessment of the model fit, availability and relevance of data and the impact of changes in business mix. The Company used the modeled statistical distribution to calculate an 80% confidence interval for the potential reserve outcomes over this one year run off period. The high and low end points of the ranges set forth in the above table are such that there is a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop higher than the high point and a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop lower than the low point. The development of a reserve range models the uncertainty of the claim environment as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data. These uncertainties and limitations are not specific to the Company. The ranges represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes over a one year development period. A range of possible outcomes should not be confused with a range of best estimates. The range of best estimates will generally be much narrower than the range of possible outcomes as it will reflect reasonable actuarial best estimates of the expected reserve. Reserve volatility was analyzed for each line of business (excluding structured indemnity) within each of the Reinsurance and Insurance segments using the Companys historical data supplemented by industry data. These ranges were then aggregated to the lines of business shown above taking into account correlation between lines of business. The practical result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges by line of business disclosed above, are narrower than the sum of the ranges of the individual lines of business. Similarly, the range for the Companys total reserves in the aggregate, is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business disclosed above. On an annual basis, the Company reviews the correlation assumptions between its various lines of business. Since 2006, the Company has utilized a simplified approach of assigning ratings of low, medium or high to its correlation assumptions for each line of business pairing based on the judgment of the reserving actuaries. This simplified approach has been utilized due to the limited amount of historical experience within its portfolio as well as limited applicable industry data. However, the Companys actual historical experience and industry data were used to judgmentally select a range of values for the low, medium and high correlations, respectively, of 15%, 30% and 50%. It should be noted that both the Companys own experience and the industry data exhibit negative correlations in reserve developments between certain lines of business. However, as a measure of prudence in evaluating the reserve ranges, the Company has used a minimum of 15% correlation between any two lines of business. The analysis of correlations and the reflection of potential diversification benefits across lines of business represent another area of uncertainty in the development of estimated reserve ranges. The Company is not aware of any generally accepted model to perform the reserve range analysis described above. However, other models may be employed to develop these ranges. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Segments below for further discussion on prior year development of loss reserves. Unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable The recognition of unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves the Companys estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of the Companys loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Unpaid losses and loss expenses and unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable). The second judgment involves the Companys estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that the Company will ultimately be unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in 81 a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance and shareholders equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. See Item 8, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Reinsurance, for further information. The Company uses a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, estimated recovery rates and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurers balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by the Company with the same legal entity for which the Company believes there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. 2) Future Policy Benefit Reserves Future policy benefit reserves relate to the Companys life operations and are estimated using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, expenses and provisions for adverse loss deviation. Uncertainties related to interest rate volatility and mortality experience make it difficult to project and value the ultimate benefit payments. Most of the Companys future policy benefit reserves relate to annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts under which the Company makes annuity payments throughout the term of the contract for a specified portfolio of policies. For certain of these contracts, a single premium is paid at inception of the contract by way of a transfer of cash and investments to the Company. The reserving methodology for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts is described in the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB for accounting and reporting by insurance for certain long duration contracts as well as authoritative guidance over realized gains and losses from the sale of investments. These contracts subject the Company to risks arising from policyholder mortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected. Liabilities for future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of this guidance. Claims and expenses for individual policies within these annuity reinsurance contracts are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows. Assumptions for each element of the basis (mortality, expenses and interest) are determined at the issue of the contract and these assumptions are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists. The assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements (i.e., mortality and interest). Provisions for adverse deviation are designed to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimate outcome of the contract. As the experience on the contracts emerges, the assumptions are reviewed. This occurs at least annually and includes both an analysis of experience and review of likely future experience. If such review would produce reserves in excess of those currently held then lock in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no adjustments to the locked in assumptions for these annuity reinsurance contracts. The future policy benefit reserves for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts amounted to $4.6 billion and $4.4 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively. The Company holds the investment assets backing these liabilities. These investments are primarily fixed income securities with maturities that closely match the expected claims settlement profile. A 0.1% decrease in the investment yield assumption would result in approximately a $34 million increase in the value of future claims related to annuity portfolio reinsurance. As stated above, the future policy benefit reserves include provisions for adverse deviation in excess of best estimate assumptions that amounted to approximately $232 million and $178 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The future policy benefit reserves would only be increased if these provisions for adverse deviation became insufficient in the light of emerging claims experience. The present value of future claims would increase by approximately $19 million if mortality rates were to decrease by 1% in all future years, relative to the reserving assumptions. 82 The Company also provides reinsurance of disability income protection, for an in force block of business. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $94 million and $97 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves include the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide an income if the policyholder becomes sick or disabled. The liabilities are therefore driven mainly by the rates at which policyholders become sick (where sickness is defined by the policy conditions) and by the rates at which these policyholders recover or die. A 1% increase in the incidence rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $1.6 million, while a 1% decrease in the termination rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $3.0 million. While no changes to the locked in assumptions were made in 2009 or in 2008, following a review of claim termination experience in 2007, the reserving assumptions were revised, resulting in a reduction in income of $10.0 million during the year. The Company also provides reinsurance of term assurance and critical illness policies written in the U.K., Ireland and the US. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $229 million and $279 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. $23 million of this reduction resulted from the sale of the U.S. life reinsurance business, XL Re Life America Inc. $124 million of this reduction resulted from the novation and recapture of a number of U.K. and Irish term assurance and critical illness treaties, which was offset by increases in reserves due to new business, ageing of the portfolio and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the U.K. Pound Sterling and Euro in 2009. Future policy benefit reserves include the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The provisions for adverse deviation in these reserves amounted to approximately $20 million and $25 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business and to treaties accepting new business through 2009, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies or becomes sick. For term assurance, the liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality and for critical illness cover, the liabilities are driven predominantly by the rates at which policyholders become sick, where sickness is defined by the treaty conditions (i.e., the morbidity rates). A 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $2.0 million, and a 1% increase in the morbidity rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $1.2 million. The term assurance and critical illness treaties have been written using a variety of structures, some of which incur acquisition costs during an initial period. For such treaties, a deferred acquisition cost (DAC) asset has been established and an increase in future lapse rates could impact the recoverability of such costs from future premiums. The recoverability will also be influenced by the impact of lapses on future claims. An increase in the annual lapse rates by 1% could lead to a 5% 10% reduction in future margins available for amortizing the DAC asset. The Company also provided reinsurance of a block of U.S. based term assurance, which was novated to the Company from an insurance affiliate in December 2002. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $259 million and $254 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of general authoritative guidance on accounting for insurance enterprises, including the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business, which are comprised of underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies. The liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality, and a 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $9 million. The liabilities are also affected by lapse experience, and a 1% decrease in lapse rates relative to the reserving assumption would increase the reserve by approximately $1.5 million. While no changes to the locked in assumptions were made in 2009 or in 2008, following a review of mortality and lapse experience in 2007, the locked in assumptions were revised, resulting in a reduction in income of $25.4 million during the year. For further information see Item 8, Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Future Policy Benefit Reserves. 83 3) Derivative Instruments With regards to derivative instruments, the Company conducts activities mainly in investment related derivative instruments, which may include credit derivatives. In addition, outside of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company previously wrote credit derivatives. The estimate of fair value for credit derivatives requires managements judgment. This is discussed below: a) Credit Derivatives The Company held credit derivative exposures through a limited number of contracts written as part of the Companys previous financial lines businesses, and through the Companys prior reinsurance agreements with Syncora, as described below. Following the secondary sale of Syncora common shares, the Company retained some credit derivative exposures written by Syncora and certain of its subsidiaries through reinsurance agreements that had certain derivatives exposures embedded within them. The change in value of the derivative portion of the financial guarantee reinsurance agreements the Company had with Syncora was included in Net (loss) income from operating affiliates. Following the closing of the Master Agreement during August 2008, as described in Item 8, Note 4, to the Consolidated Financial Statements Syncora Holdings Ltd. of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which terminated certain reinsurance and other agreements, these credit derivative exposures were eliminated by virtue of the commutation of the relevant reinsurance agreements. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008 the remaining credit derivative exposures outside of the Companys investment portfolio consisted of 2 and 23 contracts, respectively, written by the Company that provide credit protection on senior tranches of structured finance transactions with total insured contractual payments outstanding of $271.7 million ($244.9 million principal and $26.8 million interest), and $639.5 million ($499.5 million principal and $140.0 million of interest), weighted average contractual term to maturity of 6.0 years and 5.7 years, a total liability recorded of $18.4 million and $28.6 million, respectively, and an average rating of AA underlying obligations at each of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, there were no reported events of default on the underlying obligations. Credit derivatives are recorded at fair value, which is determined using either models developed by the Company or third party prices and are dependent upon a number of factors, including changes in interest rates, future default rates, credit spreads, changes in credit quality, future expected recovery rates and other market factors. The change resulting from movements in credit and credit quality spreads is unrealized as the credit derivatives are not traded to realize this resultant value. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for sensitivity analysis and Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments. 4) Other Than Temporary Declines in Investments (OTTI) The Companys process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors. These primary factors include (i) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and financial condition of the issuer including consideration of credit ratings, (ii) the significance of the decline, (iii) an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question, and (iv), for debt securities, whether the Company intends to sell such securities. In addition, the authoritative guidance requires that OTTI for certain asset backed and mortgage backed securities are recognized if the fair value of the security is less than its discounted cash flow value and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last reporting period. Where the Companys analysis of the above factors results in the Companys conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to discounted cash flow and the previously unrealized loss is therefore realized in the period such determination is made. As mentioned above, the Company considers whether it has an intent to sell a debt security before the value recovers as part of the process of evaluating whether a securitys unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline. However, this factor on its own does not dictate whether or not the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Companys belief that it will not be more likely than not required to sell securities is supported by positive and sufficient cash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payment obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments. 84 There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in general economic conditions as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, the Companys liability profile, subjective assessment of issue specific factors (seniority of claims, collateral value, etc.), future financial market effects, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant disclosure of accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, significant assumptions and management judgment are involved in determining if the decline is other than temporary. If management determines that a decline in fair value is temporary, then a securitys value is not written down at that time. However, there are potential effects upon the Companys future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of the investments are other than temporary declines. See Investment Activities hereinfor further information on other than temporary declines in the value of investments and unrealized loss on investments. Key Assumptions used in determination of credit losses related to fixed maturities The Company reviews, on a quarterly basis, the entirety of its investment portfolio in a gross unrealized loss position to assess whether it believes a credit loss, relative to the current amortized cost of the security, exists. The Company utilizes specific screening criteria to identify securities at risk for a credit loss, and if any of these conditions exists, subject the individual security to a detailed review to determine if a credit loss exists. The screening criteria used by the Company include the absolute degree of impairment of the security as a percentage of amortized cost, the credit rating of the security, the market yield to maturity of the security, and any securities that have previously been identified as impaired due to credit losses and thus are at elevated risk of further impairments. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company reviews any current market developments and identifies if there are new issues that may adversely impact the Companys investment portfolio, and reviews any impacted holdings. Credit loss methodology structured credit Credit loss on structured credit securities is determined through a comparison of the securitys discounted cash flow to the amortized cost of the security. To the extent that the discounted cash flow is estimated to be lower than the amortized cost of the security, the security is impaired to the discounted cash flow value of all security cash flows, including both coupon and principal repayment, discounted at the original security coupon, or for certain securities, the rate which represents the current yield of the securities. The Company, in conjunction with its third party investment management service providers, makes significant assumptions in its impairment analysis with regards to the following specific asset classes. These assumptions are as at December 31, 2009 and are subject to changes in both economic fundamentals and managements estimates in future periods. (1) Non Agency RMBS The Company utilizes assumptions specific to its individual holdings and accordingly individual assumptions will differ on a security by security basis depending on the quality of the collateral and the performance of the underlying pools. In general, the Company projects that future defaults will develop based on the performance of the underlying collateral, measured by the number of loans currently in arrears. Loans &gt; 30 days in arrears 50% will ultimately default Loans 30 60 days in arrears 60% will ultimately default Loans 30 90 days in arrears 75% will ultimately default Loans in foreclosure 100% default rate Bank held 75% default rate The Company estimates that the cumulative losses on the mortgage structures it owns will vary depending on the vintage and collateral of the underlying loans in the holdings. Cumulative deal loss expectations are projected based on the number of loans expected to take a loss and the severity of loss 85 upon default. Loan loss severities depend on the borrower, geographic location and loan to value characteristics of the underlying collateral. The Company estimates that loss severities will range from 40 60% for sub prime and Alt A loans and 10 20% for Prime loans. These cumulative losses results are then compared to the level of subordination within the Companys holdings to measure if impairment exists. Vintage 2007 2006 2005 2004 2nd Lien 75 % 55 % 30 % 15 % Alt A non option ARM 30 % 25 % 14 % 6 % Alt A Option ARM 39 % 33 % 19 % 10 % Prime 12 % 10 % 6 % 2 % Subprime. 47 % 40 % 23 % 12 % (2) Core CDOs The Company utilizes a scenario based approach to reviewing the majority of its CDO portfolio, which consists primarily of collateralized loan obligations. The five significant scenarios utilized in the model consist of: 2 base cases assuming asset defaults are equivalent to either the expected corporate default probabilities, or the cumulative default rates for similar time frames from the period of 1983 to 2008 Optimistic/pessimistic cases assuming assets have a default rate equivalent to 1 rating notch higher/lower than their current rating and if on positive/negative watch then 2 notches higher/lower than their current rating A market implied scenario based on the current asset market price, assuming that lower priced loans have a higher default rate The weighted scenario of the five scenarios above is used for the determination of a potential impairment. If losses are forecast to be below the subordination level for the tranche of holding held by the Company, the security is determined not to be impaired. The weighting between these scenarios varies over time depending on market conditions, but the weighting used for the year end 2009 evaluation consisted of 45% to the base cases noted above, 0% to the optimistic case, 25% to the pessimistic case, and 30% to the market implied case. For the non CLO portion of the core CDO portfolio, the Company utilizes specific default scenarios related to the particular underlying assets. (3) Other structured credit assets classes The remainder of the gross unrealized losses related to the Companys structured credit portfolio are concentrated in the following significant asset classes: Agency RMBS, which represent AAA rated holdings backed by either the explicit or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government. The Company considers the risk of loss in these asset classes remote and linked to the overall credit worthiness of the U.S. government. CMBS, which are dominated by AAA rated holdings which generally have high levels of credit subordination, are highly diversified and despite recent volatility related to credit spreads, are priced reasonably close to par. The Company reviews these holdings on an individual security basis to the extent they meet the screens noted above, but generally does not believe these securities to have a high risk of credit loss given their high subordination levels. Other ABS, which is a mix of mostly investment grade credit card, auto and non US ABS structures have risk and performance characteristics unrelated to the US housing market. In cases where these sectors have met Company screens the individual securities are evaluated based on fundamental credit analysis of the underlying structure. Impairments in this category have been limited primarily to securities with inherent extension risk as opposed to risk of default or loss of cash flow. Credit loss analysis corporates Credit losses on corporate securities are generally determined on an individual security basis. The Company reviews the circumstances and conditions associated with its credit issuers, including considering credit rating and forecast operating and financing activities of the issuer, and will make a determination as to whether it believes the issuer is likely to fully meet its contractual principal and interest obligations. To 86 the extent the Company does not believe the issuers will meet these obligations, it recognizes a credit loss as the difference between amortized cost and the estimated present value of cash flows expected to be received. The Company reviews the ability to pay at the lowest tier (i.e. most subordinated) of the capital structure at which it holds securities, and to the extent it is satisfied in the performance of the lower tier, concludes that any more senior tiers are also likely to meet obligations. The company evaluates separately credit losses associated with below investment grade hybrid securities, representing Tier One and Upper Tier Two perpetual preferred securities that have been rated below investment grade by at least one major rating agency. The Company completes a debt based impairment review, including an analysis of whether these securities are expected to meet their obligations, and whether the issuer has the ability to call these obligations at their call date. In addition, the Company uses an equity impairment model to evaluate these holdings, including assessing the expected recovery period of the securities, the length of time these securities have been rated below investment grade, and whether alternative ratings were available that indicates these securities remain investment grade, or only slightly below investment grade. In addition, the Company evaluates the likelihood of how various governments have treated the perpetual preferred shareholdings in the event of government intervention in these institutions operations or managements decision to defer calls or coupons. The Company evaluated the credit losses associated with its medium term notes, which generally represent notes backed primarily by investment grade European credit. The Company evaluates the cash flows expected from the notes over their remaining expected life, including an evaluation of the likelihood of current holdings to meet their principal and interest obligations, and incorporates current reinvestment assumptions on any security maturities or reinvestment of cash flows. These cash flows are discounted at the original yield, adjusted for changes in interest rates for floating rate securities expected from these securities, and to the extent the discounted cash flow value is below the amortized cost, recognizes an impairment charge. 5) Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company had capitalized net operating tax losses of $314.0 million and $317.3 million against which a valuation allowance of $220.7 million and $224.3 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, was established. The Company had capitalized realized and unrealized capital losses of approximately $262.4 million and $32.3 million, respectively, against which a valuation allowance of approximately $294.7 million at December 31, 2009 was established. Included within the capitalized realized losses are $168.7 million of losses arising from the sale of investments to a group company, against which a valuation allowance of $168.7 million has been established. The deferral of benefits from tax losses is evaluated based upon managements estimates of the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities based on current forecasts, the character of income and the period for which losses may be carried forward. A valuation allowance may have to be established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. Should the future income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance would have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax affected. For further information see Other Revenues and Expenses and Item 8, Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxation. 6) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company has recorded goodwill in connection with various acquisitions in prior years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with FASB issued final authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate that potential exists for the fair value of a reporting unit to be reduced to a level below its carrying amount. The Company tests for impairment at the reporting unit level in accordance with the authoritative guidance on intangibles and goodwill. For the reinsurance segment, a 87 reporting unit is one level below the business segment, while for insurance, the segment is also the reporting unit. The first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to the estimated book value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is derived based upon valuation techniques and assumptions the Company believes market participants would use to value the business and this is then compared to the book value of the business. The Company derives the net book value of its reporting units by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each reporting unit. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are generally determined utilizing methodologies that incorporate price to net tangible book and price to earnings multiples of certain comparable companies, from an operational and economic standpoint. If such estimated fair value, combined with an estimate of an appropriate control premium, indicates a close call or potential impairment, further analysis using discounted cash flows is performed. A control premium represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company. If the estimated fair value exceeds the book value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the book value exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of impairment. For further detailed information, see Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 7) Reinsurance Premium Estimates The Company writes business on both an excess of loss and proportional basis. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the subject written premium is generally outlined within the treaty and the Company receives a minimum and or deposit premium on a quarterly basis which is normally followed by an adjustment premium based on the ultimate subject premium for the contract. The Company estimates the premium written on the basis of the expected subject premium and regularly reviews this against actual quarterly statements to revise the estimate based on the information provided by the cedant. On proportional contracts, written premiums are estimated to expected ultimate premiums based on information provided by the ceding companies. An estimate of premium is recorded at the inception of the contract. The ceding companys premium estimate may be adjusted based on their history of providing accurate premium estimates. When the actual premium is reported by the ceding company, normally on a quarterly basis, it may be materially higher or lower than the estimate. Adjustments arising from the reporting of actual premium by the ceding companies are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Written premiums on excess of loss contracts are earned in accordance with the loss occurring period defined within the treaty, normally 12 months following inception of the contract. Written premiums on proportional contracts are earned over the risk periods of the underlying policies issued and renewed, normally 24 months. For both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the earned premium is recognized ratably over the earning period, namely 12 24 months. The portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected in unearned premiums. Reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre defined contract terms and are fully earned when recognized. Accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on the Companys estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which involves management judgment as described below. Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications in that generally the ultimate premium due under a specific contract will not be known at the time the contract is entered into. As a result, more judgment and ongoing monitoring is required to establish premiums written and earned in the Companys reinsurance operations. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of premiums receivable related to the Companys reinsurance operations amounted to $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. A significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable, which represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions, are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Management reviews the premiums receivable balance at least quarterly and provides a provision for amounts deemed to be uncollectible. The Company recorded a provision for uncollectible premiums 88 receivable related to its reinsurance operations at December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $4.8 million and $19.0 million, respectively. The amount of proportional and excess of loss reinsurance gross premiums written and gross acquisition expenses recognized by the Companys reinsurance operations for each line of business for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses Proportional Contracts: Casualty other lines 44,924 12,075 47,791 16,777 133,444 52,062 Casualty professional lines 41,195 12,652 62,268 20,772 47,361 23,413 Other property 703,219 164,094 745,244 148,066 739,130 201,170 Marine, energy, aviation and satellite 34,636 8,116 32,935 14,101 47,359 14,981 Other (1) 144,116 40,628 197,418 25,339 222,374 37,177 Total Proportional contracts $ 968,090 $ 237,565 $ 1,085,656 $ 225,055 $ 1,189,668 $ 328,803 (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 December 31,2007 GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses GrossPremiumsWritten GrossAcquisitionExpenses Excess of loss Contracts: Property catastrophe $ 357,267 $ 33,074 $ 401,740 $ 30,688 $ 475,540 $ 46,621 Casualty other lines 173,853 34,383 308,932 50,565 409,807 69,133 Casualty professional lines 129,733 26,241 151,251 29,696 208,919 45,476 Other property 159,091 12,892 202,655 18,096 231,066 21,724 Marine, energy, aviation and satellite 54,463 5,429 86,658 9,191 103,189 11,121 Other (1) 11,978 2,642 22,914 8,792 17,044 2,956 Structured Indemnity 4,948 2,566 671 2,699 28,261 374 Total Excess of loss contracts $ 891,333 $ 117,227 $ 1,174,821 $ 149,727 $ 1,473,826 $ 197,405 (1) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. Segments Following a streamlining of the Companys operating segments in the first quarter of 2009, the Company is organized into three operating segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Life Operations in addition to a Corporate segment that includes the general investment and financing operations of the Company. The Company evaluates the performance of both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments based on underwriting profit and contribution from its Life Operations segment. Other items of revenue and expenditure of the Company are not evaluated at the segment level for reporting purposes. In addition, the Company does not allocate investment assets by segment for its property and casualty (P&C) operations. Investment assets related to the Companys Life Operations and certain structured products included in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments and in Corporate are held in separately identified portfolios. As such, net investment income from these assets is included in the contribution from each of these segments. See Item 8, Note 6 Segment Information for a reconciliation of segment data to the Companys consolidated financial statements. 89 Income Statement Analysis Insurance The following table summarizes the underwriting profit (loss) for the Insurance segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2009 % Change2009 vs 2008 2008 % Change2008 vs 2007 2007 Gross premiums written $ 4,251,888 (19.9 )% $ 5,308,914 (2.3 )% $ 5,434,266 Net premiums written 3,273,380 (17.9 )% 3,984,826 (4.8 )% 4,186,855 Net premiums earned 3,559,793 (10.9 )% 3,997,045 (2.9 )% 4,116,588 Net losses and loss expenses. 2,399,747 (12.2 )% 2,733,344 5.3 % 2,594,812 Acquisition costs 429,170 (7.7 )% 465,044 (3.9 )% 484,014 Operating expenses 689,131 0.3 % 687,129 0.6 % 683,108 Underwriting profit $ 41,745 (62.6 )% $ 111,528 (68.6 )% $ 354,654 Net results structured products $ 16,660 NM * $ (14,713 ) NM * $ (2,480 ) Net fee income and other (14,241 ) NM * (5,072 ) NM * 11,812 * NM Not Meaningful Gross and net premiums written decreased by 19.9% and 17.9%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in gross premiums was seen across virtually all lines of business due to a combination of factors including, strategic decisions to exit specific lines of business, poor market and economic conditions, impacts of the S&P downgrade in December 2008 which directly affected retention early in the year and new business opportunities, decreases in insured values, fewer long term agreements which are being renewed on a single year basis and unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts. Offsetting the overall decrease was growth in professional lines and new business from the Companys middle market strategy. The renewal pricing has steadily improved throughout 2009 over most lines of business, with an overall modest increase of 1% across the entire book. Retention rates have largely returned to historic levels. The decrease in net premiums written was due to the decrease in gross premiums written noted above partially offset by a reduction in ceded premiums as compared to the same period in 2008. The relative decrease in ceded premium was driven by a shift from proportional to excess of loss treaties partially offset with increased rates in property and environmental lines. Gross premiums written decreased by 2.3% during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with 2007, primarily as a result of continued decreases in premium rates as market conditions continued to soften, a reduction in long term agreements in late 2008, selective non renewals and to a lesser extent, lost business opportunities associated with rating agency downgrades that occurred in 2008. Such decreases in gross premiums written were primarily within casualty and professional lines of business as well as certain specialty lines including environmental, aerospace and marine portfolios. Partially offsetting these decreases was growth in certain property lines, particularly in the construction book in Europe, as well as excess and surplus and middle market lines and favorable foreign exchange rate movements totaling $108.4 million. Net premiums written decreased by 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the decrease in gross premiums written described above coupled with an increase in ceded premiums written associated with growth in certain property lines, change in the mix of business including an increase in long term agreements with higher cession ratios, the impact from the purchase of an adverse development cover associated with a Company owned Lloyds syndicate and unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts of $29.6 million. Net premiums earned decreased by 10.9% in 2009 as compared to 2008 and by 2.9% in 2008 as compared to 2007. These decreases were primarily a reflection of the overall reduction of net premiums written over the last 12 to 24 months. 90 The following table presents the ratios for the Insurance segment for each of the last three years ended December 31: 2009 2008 2007 Loss and loss expense ratio 67.4 % 68.4 % 63.0 % Underwriting expense ratio 31.4 % 28.8 % 28.4 % Combined ratio 98.8 % 97.2 % 91.4 % The loss and loss expense ratio noted above includes net losses incurred for both the reported year and any favorable or adverse prior year development of loss and loss expense reserves held at the beginning of the year. The following table summarizes the net (favorable) adverse prior year development by line of business relating to the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Property $ (50.7 ) $ (106.0 ) $ (95.0 ) Casualty and Professional (41.0 ) (214.1 ) (139.1 ) Specialty and Other 28.8 9.6 76.0 Structured Indemnity 5.0 Total $ (62.9 ) $ (305.5 ) $ (158.1 ) Loss and loss expense ratio excluding prior year development 69.2 % 76.0 % 66.9 % In addition, the following tables present the prior year (favorable) adverse development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves within the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: Gross: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 14,373 $ 14,856 $ 14,528 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (45 ) (610 ) (178 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 14,328 $ 14,246 $ 14,350 Net: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 11,126 $ 11,138 $ 10,608 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (63 ) (305 ) (158 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 11,063 $ 10,833 $ 10,450 Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 6.8 loss percentage points as compared 2008 due primarily to lower levels of large property risk and catastrophe losses occurring in 2009 combined with the impact of anticipated sub prime and credit related losses in 2008. These decreases were partially offset by increased current year loss ratios in certain casualty lines including US risk management. The remainder of the benefit was attributable to better loss experience on the excess and surplus lines of business as compared to 2008. Net favorable prior year reserve development of $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 was mainly attributable to the following: For property lines, net prior year development during the year was $50.7 million favorable largely as a result of a lower than expected level of attritional non catastrophe claims across older accident years as well as reserve releases in the 2008 European general property portfolio due to lower than expected reported loss activity. Prior year catastrophe loss estimates remained stable. For casualty lines, net prior year development during the year was $29.4 million unfavorable due to reserve strengthening on the European excess lines for accident years 2000 2004, and the recognition of potential excess casualty exposures on the discontinued casualty lines. Offsetting this reserve 91 strengthening were reserve releases from the casualty primary business due to better than expected loss activity from the more recent accident years, and US risk management lines due to greater reliance on actual loss experience over initial target loss ratios. For professional lines, net prior year development was $70.4 million favorable, primarily as a result of lower incurred activity than expected based on the Companys prior valuation in global D&O lines, primarily for underwriting years 2002 to 2006. This release was partially offset by strengthening of global E&O reserves primarily in the 2000 and 2001 years due to large claims. In addition, there was a reallocation of subprime and related credit crisis reserves from the 2007 to 2008 report year to better reflect the indications of our latest exposure based reserve analysis for these years. For specialty and other lines, net prior year adverse development was $28.8 million due in part to a deterioration in environmental lines but mainly from discontinued specialty lines, specifically, for surety to reflect our assessment of the potential impact of the economic downturn on ultimate loss activity, the Lloyds Accident & Health book where incurred development was higher than implied by the Companys selected benchmarks and the resulting lengthening of loss reporting patterns, and political risks where there was reserve strengthening on a specific potential claim. Offsetting the adverse development was favorable reserve development on the aerospace and marine and offshore energy lines due to better than expected activity and an update of development assumptions to reflect recent historical experience. Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 9.1 loss percentage points as compared to 2007 with 2.6 points of the loss ratio increase attributable to a higher level of catastrophe losses in the 2008 year, including the impacts of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, which resulted in net incurred losses in the Companys Insurance segment of $54.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums. The remainder of the increase in loss ratio was attributable to an increase in loss activity in the property line of business, loss activity anticipated for professional lines related to sub prime and related credit events, premium adjustments booked in the third and fourth quarters as well as the softening rate environment impacting most lines of business. Net favorable prior year development of $305.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 was mainly attributable to the following: For property and casualty lines, reserve releases in certain casualty lines primarily in 2003 to 2006 accident years due to lower than expected reported loss activity and favorable reserve development in global property lines of business as a result of favorable claim development. In addition, net reserve releases resulted from an agreement with AXA/Winterthur of approximately $80.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in regards to certain reinsurance recoverable balances relating to casualty lines and, to a lesser extent, certain property lines of business. For professional lines, reserve releases in the 2003 to 2006 accident years were largely offset by strengthening of reserves in the 2007 year. For specialty lines, modest reserve strengthening within specialty lines, primarily in the environmental lines of business, as well as strengthening associated with certain structured indemnity contracts. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, was due to an increase in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.5 points (12.1% as compared to 11.6%) combined with an increase in the operating expense ratio of 2.1 points (19.3% as compared to 17.2%). The increase in the acquisition expense ratio was primarily as a result of changes in the mix of business given the decreases in property and casualty lines which carry the lowest levels of acquisition cost. The increase in the operating expense ratio is attributable to the lower level of earned premium combined with the costs associated with the Companys expense reduction initiatives announced in the third quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 including changes to the Companys previously communicated operational transformation program and the insurance segments recently announced internal business realignment. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, was due to an increase in the operating expense ratio of 0.6 points (17.2% as compared to 16.6%) 92 and partially offset by a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.2 points (11.6% as compared to 11.8%). The increase in the operating expense ratio was mainly as a result of a higher headcount, which increased compensation, increases in professional fees and the impact of employee termination benefits recorded in the latter half of 2008, against lower net premiums earned. The increase in headcount and professional fees both supported new segment initiatives as well as the formation of XL GAPS in late 2007. Offsetting these increases in 2008 were decreases in performance related compensation. The acquisition expense ratio decreased mainly due to a reduction in foreign excise taxes as a result of a decrease in the cession percentage of an internal quota share from 75% to 50%, lower guarantee fund assessments and the impact of changes in the mix of business written. Fee income decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 mainly as a result of lower engineering fee income associated with the Companys loss prevention consulting services business coupled with other expenses in professional lines due to the cost of the National Indemnity facility. Fee income increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly as a result of higher engineering fee revenue associated with XL GAPS. Net results from structured insurance products include certain structured indemnity contracts that are accounted for as deposit contracts. Net results from these products for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased compared to the same period in 2008 mainly due to an accretion adjustment based on changes in expected cashflows of a structured indemnity contract recorded in 2008, lower operating expenses of this run off line of business and favorable development in the liability interest rate hedges in place, partially offset by lower net investment income as a result of lower yields combined with a lower average investment asset base. Results from these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to lower net investment income and higher operating expenses, partially offset by lower interest expense. Net investment income decreased as a result of lower yields earned on investment income while operating expenses increased as a result of costs recorded in the latter half of 2008 associated with employee termination benefits relating to the closure of the XLFS business unit as noted above. Interest expense decreased mainly due to negotiated cancellation of certain contracts in 2008 was partially offset by an accretion adjustment recorded during the same period, based on changes in expected cash flows on a structured indemnity contract. Reinsurance The following table summarizes the underwriting profit (loss) for this segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2009 % Change2009 vs 2008 2008 % Change2008 vs 2007 2007 Gross premiums written $ 1,859,423 (17.7 )% $ 2,260,477 (15.1 )% $ 2,663,494 Net premiums written 1,470,332 (16.1 )% 1,753,467 (16.9 )% 2,110,865 Net premiums earned 1,591,946 (20.1 )% 1,993,206 (13.4 )% 2,302,039 Net losses and loss expenses 769,090 (37.4 )% 1,229,554 (1.2 )% 1,244,764 Acquisition costs 346,699 (9.5 )% 383,136 (20.5 )% 482,024 Operating expenses 190,596 0.8 % 189,027 (8.2 )% 205,966 Underwriting profit $ 285,561 49.1 % $ 191,489 (48.1 )% $ 369,285 Net results structured products 26,374 2.6 % 25,694 0.7 % 25,520 Fee income and other 6,209 (32.9 )% 9,260 NM * 1,698 * NM Not meaningful Gross and net premiums written decreased by 17.7% and 16.1%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. The decrease in gross premiums written is mainly a result of the Companys focus on short tail lines, certain lost renewals and reduced business as a result of the S&P ratings downgrade in December 2008, strategic decisions to exit certain lines of business and unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements. Partially offsetting these decreases were rate increases in certain lines of business including property catastrophe, marine and aviation lines. The decrease in net premiums written was due to the decrease in gross premiums written noted above partially offset by a reduction in ceded premiums as compared to the same period in 2008. This decrease was mainly as a result of the cancellation and non renewal of Cyrus Re II at December 31, 2008 and a reduction in the ceded premium on the US agricultural program. Cyrus Re II previously assumed a 10% cession of certain lines of 93 property catastrophe reinsurance and retrocession business underwritten by certain operating subsidiaries of the Company. Gross and net premiums written decreased by 15.1% and 16.9%, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007. These decreases resulted from the Company declining business due to competitive pressures continuing to drive certain rates below the Companys acceptable underwriting return levels together with increased client retentions. Partially offsetting these decreases in gross premiums written were favorable foreign exchange rate movements of $55.0 million and increases of $118.4 million associated with a U.S. agricultural program whose rates are tied to commodity prices, which have increased in 2008. Ceded premiums written decreased mainly as a result of the impact of a reduction in property catastrophe cessions to Cyrus Re II of 10% in 2008 as compared to a 35% cession to Cyrus Re throughout 2007, partially offset by ceded premiums totaling $23.3 million associated with the purchase of additional catastrophe loss protection in the form of industry loss warranty covers. However, the overall ceded ratio increased mainly due to lower net retention in 2008 as compared to 2007, mainly due to higher cession ratios associated with the U.S. agricultural program noted above, causing net premiums written to decrease at a higher percentage than gross premiums written. Net premiums earned decreased by 20.1% in 2009 as compared to 2008 and by 13.4% in 2008 as compared to 2007. These decreases were primarily a reflection of the overall reduction of net premiums written over the last three years. The following table presents the ratios for the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: 2009 2008 2007 Loss and loss expense ratio 48.3 % 61.7 % 54.1 % Underwriting expense ratio 33.8 % 28.7 % 29.8 % Combined ratio 82.1 % 90.4 % 83.9 % The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred in the reported year and any favorable or adverse prior year development of loss reserves held at the beginning of the year. The following table summarizes the net (favorable) adverse prior year development by line of business relating to the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Property and other short tail lines $ (142.5 ) $ (138.4 ) $ (188.7 ) Casualty and other (80.3 ) (166.8 ) (87.4 ) Structured Indemnity 1.0 8.8 Total $ (221.8 ) $ (305.2 ) $ (267.3 ) Loss and loss expense ratio excluding prior year development 62.2 % 77.0 % 65.7 % In addition, the following tables present the prior year (favorable) adverse development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves within the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: Gross loss and loss expense reserves: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 7,278 $ 8,001 $ 8,193 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (257 ) (444 ) (260 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 7,021 $ 7,557 $ 7,933 94 Net loss and loss expense reserves: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 6,559 $ 7,053 $ 7,138 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (222 ) (305 ) (267 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 6,337 $ 6,748 $ 6,871 Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by 14.8 loss percentage points as compared to an increase in the same period in 2008 with 11.3 loss ratio points attributable primarily to the impact of catastrophe losses occurring in 2008 compared to 2009. Losses related to 2009 catastrophes included Hailstorm Wolfgang, Japan Earthquake, Windstorm Klaus, Typhoon Ketsana, Asian Earthquake/Tsunami and Australian Wildfires. 2008 catastrophes included losses related to Hurricanes Ike & Gustav, Midwest Floods, Windstorm Emma, China Snowstorm, Australian Floods, Greece Earthquake, China Earthquakes and Hailstorm Detmold. Net favorable prior year reserve development for the Reinsurance segment of $221.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 was mainly attributable to the following: Net favorable prior year development of $142.5 million for the short tailed lines in the year and details of these by specific lines are as follows: $46.2 million in favorable property catastrophe development due to lower than expected loss development, particularly on the 2008 underwriting year and $12.3 million in reserve reductions for several 2005 natural catastrophe events including European floods, windstorm Erwin and California wildfires. $88.8 million in favorable development due primarily to lower than expected claim emergence from underwriting years 2005 2008 in Latin America ($27.5 million), Europe ($21.6 million), Bermuda ($20.6 million) and US ($13.8 million). $7.5 million in marine and aviation lines due to lower than expected claim emergence in the European marine book for underwriting years 2007 and 2008 offset by minimal net reserve increases on the aviation book. Net favorable prior year development of $79.3 million for the long tailed lines in the year and details of these by specific lines are as follows: $21.0 million in favorable casualty development related primarily to the European General Liability and UK Motor portfolios in underwriting years 2004 2007. $40.7 million in favorable professional development due primarily to US exposures for underwriting years 2002 and prior in addition to professional indemnity exposures for European underwriting years 2006 and prior. $17.6 million in favorable development in non casualty long tail lines largely in Latin America due to favorable emergence from surety exposures. Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by 11.3 loss percentage points as compared to the same period in 2007 with 7.7 points attributable to an increase in catastrophe losses occurring during 2008 (12.0 points in 2008 versus 4.3 points in 2007), mainly as a result of the impacts of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav, which resulted in net incurred losses in the Companys Reinsurance segment of $155.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums. The remaining increase of 3.6 loss ratio points was attributable to the softening rate environment, higher attritional property losses and higher anticipated loss activity in the professional and trade credit portfolios. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net favorable prior year development totaled $305.2 million as explained below. Net favorable prior year development of $138.4 million for the property and other short tailed lines development were attributable to most business units globally. 95 Net favorable prior year development of $166.8 million for the casualty and other lines in both European and U.S. casualty and professional portfolios as well as reserve releases associated with the reinsurance to close relating to the 2005 year of account on certain Lloyds sourced business. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, was due to an increase in both operating expense and acquisition expense ratios to 12.0% and 21.8%, respectively, as compared with 9.5% and 19.2%, in 2008. Despite the marginal increase in operating expenses, there was a disproportionately larger increase in the operating expense ratio due to a greater percentage decrease in net premiums earned. The increase in the acquisition expense ratio relates to changes in the mix of business, increased commissions associated with the U.S. agricultural program as well as increased profit related commissions associated with certain Bermuda based property catastrophe business. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared with the same period in 2007, was due to a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 1.7 points (19.2% compared to 20.9%) and was partially offset by an increase in the operating expense ratio of 0.6 points (9.5% compared to 8.9%). The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio was primarily due to a favorable variance in performance related commissions in 2008 as compared to 2007. Although operating expenses were lower in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007, the lower level of net premiums earned as noted above caused an increase in the operating expense ratio. The decrease in operating expenses was mainly as a result of a bad debt provision and higher performance related compensation expenses both recorded in 2007 and was partially offset by the impact in 2008 of costs associated with the Companys restructuring activities as well as administrative expenses associated with the expansion of the Companys reinsurance operations in Brazil. Fee income decreased by $3.1 million during 2009 as compared to 2008 mainly as a result of fees associated with capacity utilization with certain Lloyds syndicates in 2008 that were not repeated in 2009. Fee income increased by $7.6 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly as a result of fees associated with capacity utilization with certain Lloyds syndicates. Net results from structured reinsurance products include certain structured indemnity contracts that are accounted for as deposit contracts. Net results from these products for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased slightly compared to the same period in 2008 mainly due to lower operating expenses of this run off line of business and favorable development in the liability interest rate hedges in place partially offset by lower net investment income as a result of lower yields combined with a lower average investment asset base. Results from these products for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased slightly compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to lower interest expenses associated with a higher accretion rate recorded in 2007 on certain workers compensation coverage partially offset by lower net investment income from lower yields earned on invested assets in 2008 as compared to 2007 combined with the impact of a lower average investment asset base. Life Operations As noted above, the Company completed a strategic review of its Life reinsurance business in early 2009. This resulted in the Company selling the renewal rights to a portion of its European life, accident and health reinsurance business, a relatively small block of business, in December 2008, as well as ceasing to write new U.K. and Irish life and annuity business from March 2009. In July 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its U.S. life reinsurance business and this transaction concluded during the fourth quarter of 2009. Business previously written by the Life Operations segment was primarily European life reinsurance and included term assurances, group life, critical illness cover, immediate annuities, disability income cover, and short term life, accident and health business. 96 The following table summarizes the contribution from the life segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2009 % Change2009 vs 2008 2008 % Change2008 vs 2007 2007 Gross premiums written $ 576,162 (16.6 )% $ 690,915 (7.0 )% $ 743,220 Net premiums written 532,852 (18.0 )% 649,844 (7.0 )% 698,693 Net premiums earned 555,101 (14.6 )% 649,851 (7.3 )% 701,047 Claims and policy benefits 677,562 (11.9 )% 769,004 (13.5 )% 888,658 Acquisition costs 77,689 (19.3 )% 96,280 5.9 % 90,923 Operating expenses 16,009 (51.7 )% 33,178 (4.8 )% 34,838 Net investment income 332,425 (13.2 )% 382,995 (1.9 )% 390,227 Net fee income and other 290 (17.1 )% 350 (49.9 )% 698 Realized and unrealized (losses) on investments (232,375 ) NM * (40,128 ) (18.8 )% (33,770 ) Contribution from Life Operations $ (115,819 ) NM * $ 94,606 NM * $ 43,783 * NM Not meaningful The following table is an analysis of the Life Operations gross premiums written, net premiums written and net premiums earned for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned GrossPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsWritten NetPremiumsEarned Other Life $ 413,831 $ 400,345 $ 422,594 $ 498,387 $ 492,346 $ 492,353 $ 435,415 $ 427,337 $ 429,690 Annuity 162,331 132,507 132,507 192,528 157,498 157,498 307,805 271,356 271,357 Total $ 576,162 $ 532,852 $ 555,101 $ 690,915 $ 649,844 $ 649,851 $ 743,220 $ 698,693 $ 701,047 Gross premiums written relating to total life business decreased by $114.8 million in the year to December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 mainly due to $79.7 million of lower renewal premiums associated with the short term life, accident and health business as the renewal rights for this business were sold in late 2008. In addition, while premium growth of $25.6 million was experienced in the core underlying book of term assurance and critical illness business, unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements of $33.7 million more than offset such growth during the year. Partially offsetting these decreases was premium growth of $3.2 million related to U.S. life business. Gross premiums written relating to annuity business decreased by $30.2 million during the year, mainly due to unfavorable exchange rate movements of $26.5 million. While gross premiums written decreased during the year to December 31, 2009, ceded premiums written increased slightly by $2.2 million mainly as a result of the 100% retrocession ratio of the small amount of short term life, accident and health business underwritten in the 2009 underwriting year, which occurred as part of the sale of the renewal rights as noted above. While in 2009 and 2008 the Companys Life Operations did not assume any new long duration single premium annuity portfolios, gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned and claims and policy benefits in the year ended December 31, 2007 included the assumption of one Irish immediate annuity portfolio bound, for which net premium earned totaled $94.6 million. The Company acquired cash and investment assets related to the future policy benefit reserves assumed at inception of this large contract. Gross premiums written relating to other life business increased by $63.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to premium growth in the core underlying book of term assurance and critical illness business of $47.0 million and premium growth in U.S. business of $25.0 million, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements of $16.0 million. In addition, gross premiums written related to short term life, accident and health business increased by $7.0 million primarily as a result of favorable foreign exchange rate movements and partially by decreases in gross premiums written associated with soft market conditions experienced in 2008. Gross premiums written relating to annuity business decreased by $115.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to a single Irish immediate annuity contract totaling $94.6 million written during 2007, unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements of $19.3 million 97 and $1.4 million lower premiums from other annuity business which decreases through time as defined by the treaties. Ceded premiums written were roughly consistent with the prior year. Net premiums earned in the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 14.6% as compared to the same period in 2008 and in the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by 7.3% as compared to the same period in 2007. The decrease in 2009 and 2008 were consistent with the movements in total gross and net premiums written as described above. Changes in claims and policy benefit reserves were generally consistent with movements in gross and net premiums written. Claims and policy benefit reserves decreased by $91.4 million or 11.9% in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of the factors noted above affecting gross and net premiums written. Claims and policy benefit reserves decreased by $119.7 million or 13.5% in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007, primarily as a result of the factors noted above affecting gross and net premiums written, combined with a loss recognition adjustment of $25.4 million recorded in 2007 relating to certain novated blocks of U.S. based term life mortality reinsurance business and partially offset by higher incurred losses of $11.5 million associated with certain short term life, accident and health business. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, acquisition costs decreased by 19.3% as compared to the same period in 2008, largely as a result of the lower renewal premiums associated with the short term life, accident and health business as noted above and favorable foreign exchange rate impacts. Operating expenses decreased by 51.7% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to lower compensation expenses resulting from lower headcount and lower costs related to acquisition of new business. Acquisition costs in 2008 increased by 5.9% as compared to the same period in 2007, largely as a result of the growth in regular premium business as noted above and partially offset by a favorable profit commission adjustment associated with the short term life, accident and health business and favorable foreign exchange rate impacts. Operating expenses decreased by 4.8% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to lower performance based compensation expenses and a decrease in professional fees as a result of costs recorded in 2007 related to an actuarial loss reserve review. Net investment income is included in the calculation of contribution from Life Operations, as it relates to income earned on portfolios of separately identified and managed life investment assets and other allocated assets. Net investment income decreased by $50.6 million or 13.2% in the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, primarily as a result of negative foreign exchange rate and yield impacts and partially offset by higher net investment income associated with growth in the average size of the investment asset balances and higher capital allocated to the Life operations. However, it should be noted that, as at December 31, 2009, approximately $0.4 billion of the gross unrealized losses on the Companys investments related to portfolios of Life Operations investment assets primarily as a result of increases in credit spreads during this period, primarily in the U.K. and Euro zone, and the long duration of the underlying assets. Refer to Balance Sheet Analysis below for further discussion of unrealized losses and gains on investments. Net investment income decreased by $7.2 million or 1.9% in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily as a result of negative foreign exchange rate impacts and partially offset by increases in the average size of investment asset balances as a result of putting in more capital.

Investment Activities The following table illustrates the change in net investment income from property and casualty operations, net income (loss) from investment fund affiliates, net realized (losses) on investments, and net 98 realized and unrealized (losses) on investment and other derivative instruments for each of the three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2009 % Change2009 vs 2008 2008 % Change2008 vs 2007 2007 Net investment income property and casualty operations (1) $ 882,748 (24.9 )% $ 1,174,856 (8.9 )% $ 1,289,554 Net income (loss) from investment fund affiliates (2) 78,867 NM * (277,696 ) NM * 326,007 Net realized (losses) on investments (3) (921,437 ) 4.2 % (962,054 ) (59.5 )% (603,268 ) Net realized and unrealized (losses) on investment and other derivative instruments (4) (33,647 ) 54.1 % (73,368 ) (32.3 )% (55,451 ) (1) Net investment income relating to property and casualty operations does not include the net investment income related to the net results from structured products.

(3) Results to March 31, 2009 include charges for OTTI related to the non credit impairment of unrealized losses. From April 1, 2009, the non credit impairment is excluded from realized losses. (4) For a summary of realized and unrealized gains and losses on all derivative instruments, see Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments. * NM Not meaningful Net investment income related to property and casualty operations decreased in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 due primarily to declining portfolio yields. Overall, investment portfolio yields have decreased as a result of the impact of declines in short term U.S. interest rates, and particularly the impact of decreased U.S. Dollar Libor on the Companys floating rate securities previously supporting the GIC and funding agreement business. In addition, the Company increased its holdings in lower yielding cash, government and agency securities in connection with its portfolio de risking efforts as the Company re aligns its portfolio to one more in line with a P&C portfolio and to increase liquidity. Net income from investment fund affiliates includes earnings from the Companys investments in closed end investment funds and partnerships and similar vehicles that are equity accounted. Net income from investment fund affiliates in the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted from the significant improvement in market sentiment and rallies in risk assets. Credit sensitive and relative value managers particularly benefited from tightening credit spreads and normalization of previously dislocated relative value relationships. Volatility remained high relative to historical levels, allowing alternative managers to be more opportunistic and take advantage of pricing dislocations, but offset by the negative mark to market in its private investment portfolio reflecting fair value adjustments, particularly from fourth quarter of 2008. Net loss from investment fund affiliates in the year ended December 31, 2008 reflected negative returns in the companys alternative portfolio as a result of broad based market declines, extreme volatility, a sharp pull back in the availability of credit and short sale restrictions resulting from the market credit crisis. Net income from investment fund affiliates in the year ended December 31, 2007 reflected exceptional results in the alternative portfolio, combined with a higher investment base. Investment Performance The Company manages its investment grade fixed income securities in accordance with investment guidelines approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. Due to the unique nature of the underlying liabilities, customized benchmarks are used to measure investment performance and comparison to standard market indices is not meaningful. Investment performance is not monitored for certain assets primarily consisting of operating cash and special regulatory deposits. The following is a summary of the 99 investment portfolio returns for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of the fixed income portfolio and non fixed income portfolios: 2009(1) 2008(1) Fixed income Portfolio USD fixed income portfolio 7.9% (9.2)% GBP fixed income portfolio 11.2% (5.0)% EUR fixed income portfolio 7.9% (1.0)% Other Portfolios Alternative portfolio (2). 16.0% (16.3)% Equity portfolio (8.2)% (44.1)% High Yield fixed income portfolio 47.1% (22.9)% (1) Portfolio returns are calculated by dividing the sum of the net investment income or net income from investment fund affiliates, realized gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) by the average market value of each portfolio. Performance is measured in either the underlying asset currency or the functional currency. (2) Performance on the alternative portfolio reflects the twelve months ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net Realized Gains and Losses on Investments Net realized losses on investments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 included net realized losses of approximately $812.5 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys fixed income, equity and other investments, as compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Impairment charges to March 31, 2009 include charges of OTTI related to the non credit impairment of unrealized losses. From April 1, 2009, as a result of changes in GAAP, the non credit impairment is excluded from net impairments. In addition, included in the net realized losses noted above are net realized losses of $131.9 million from sales of investments and net realized losses of $10.9 million from the sale of the U.S. life reinsurance business. The significant assumptions and inputs associated with the net impairment charges of $812.5 million consist of: For corporate securities, excluding medium term notes backed primarily by investment grade European credit, the Company recorded net impairments totaling $151.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The impairment charges consisted of below investment grade securities and hybrids, where the Company considered impairment factors consistent with both equity impairment model and debt impairment model, and, accordingly, recorded impairment charges to fair value, or securities in an unrealized loss position that management intended to sell. In addition, the Company recorded impairments totaling $226.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 in relation to medium term notes backed primarily by investment grade European credit. Management has concluded that, following credit spread movements during 2009, future yields within the supporting collateral were not sufficient to support the previously reported amortized cost. For structured credit securities, the Company recorded net impairments of $406.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company determined that the likely recovery on these securities was below the carrying value, and, accordingly, impaired the securities to the discounted value of the cash flows of these securities. For equity securities, the Company recorded net impairments of $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively, primarily representing securities in an unrealized loss position that management does not have the intent to hold to recovery. For the year ended December 31, 2009, included in the above totals is $160.6 million related to changes to intent to hold up to March 31, 2009, or intent to sell from April, 2009, primarily representing exchanges of hybrid securities, and as part of the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring charge. Net realized losses on investments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 included net realized losses of approximately $1,023.6 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys fixed income, equity and other investments, including those relating to Lehman, where the Company 100 determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments, including a charge of $400.0 million related to assets for which the Company could no longer assert its intent to hold until recovery. See below for further information. During the fourth quarter of 2008, management recorded a charge for OTTI of $400.0 million on assets for which it could no longer assert its intent to hold until recovery. Although management believed that these securities were likely to recover to their current amortized cost, it determined that these securities were at risk for further mark to market declines, and potentially real economic losses, to the extent that economic conditions were to deteriorate further than present estimates and the Companys allocation to these asset classes is overweight relative to a traditional P&C investment portfolio. In 2007, net realized losses on investments were $603.3 million which included $1,012.8 million of gross realized losses on fixed income and $46.9 million of gross realized losses on equity securities. Gross realized losses in 2007 included $611.0 million of provisions for declines in fair value considered to be other than temporary. As a percentage of the total fixed income portfolio, the write down for other than temporary declines was 1.5% in 2007. Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on Derivatives Net realized and unrealized losses on investment derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 resulted from the Companys investment strategy to manage interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk, and to replicate permitted investments. Derivative losses in 2009 relate primarily to the impact of tightening credit spreads on certain credit derivatives purchased within the investment portfolio. In 2008, derivative losses were driven by foreign currency exchange losses recognized on a Sterling forward currency contract hedging US dollar assets supporting Sterling liabilities in the life operations during the year. In 2007, the results were driven primarily from a mark to market loss of $37.0 million with respect to a total return swap on the capital notes of a structured investment vehicle impacted by the markdown in the underlying net asset value of the assets underlying the capital notes, combined with mark to market losses associated with the Companys capital, investment and hedging activities.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded $1.4 billion in losses related to reinsurance and guarantee arrangements with Syncora. Net losses from financial operating affiliates in 2007 include the results and related write downs associated with Syncora and Primus Guaranty Ltd as well as the impact of losses recorded on previous reinsurance transactions with Syncora. For further details relating to Syncora and the closing of the Master Agreement, see Results of Operations above as well as Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Syncora Holdings Ltd. (Syncora). Investment manager affiliate income increased by 63.0% during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of the improved conditions for alternative asset managers in the second half of 2009 resulting in higher accrued fees. The Company also benefited from a modest gain associated with its withdrawal at the end of 2009 from one of its investment manager affiliates. Investment manager affiliate income decreased by $83.8 million or 88.5% during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the volatility in both the credit and equity markets, impacting investment manager affiliates specializing in global equities and fixed income securities most significantly. As a result of improving market conditions, there were small increases across the strategic operating affiliates portfolio, which increased income by 13.9% in the year ended December 31, 2009 over the same period of 2008. Net income from other strategic operating affiliates decreased in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly due to lower earnings reported in 2008 from both an insurance affiliate which writes largely direct U.S. homeowners insurance and the Companys Brazilian joint venture ITA&Uacute; XL. Offsetting these decreases was earnings from an investment in an affiliate entered into in the second quarter of 2008 that provides reinsurance to certain Lloyds syndicates. Net income from other strategic operating affiliates in 2007 was primarily as a result of strong results from the same insurance affiliate noted above which writes largely U.S. homeowners insurance and the Companys Brazilian joint venture ITA&Uacute; XL. Foreign exchange losses in the year ended December 31, 2009 were primarily to the change in the value of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies including the U.K. Sterling and Euro on certain inter company balances. Corporate operating expenses decreased by 35.9% during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of the cost savings achieved from the restructuring activities implemented in 2008 and early 2009 as well as higher professional fees associated with the capital raise and associated costs related to the Master Agreement that was executed in July 2008. For further information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. In connection with the early redemption of the 6.58% Notes noted above, the Company recorded debt extinguishment costs of approximately $22.5 million in 2008. Interest expense from property and casualty operations includes costs related to the Companys debt and collateral facilities as well as certain deposit liability accretion. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 was lower mainly as a result of lower interest associated with the retirement of the 2011 Senior Notes in February 2009 partially offset by interest 102 associated with 8.25% senior notes which are part of the 10.75% Equity Security Units issued in August 2008. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 was lower primarily due to costs associated with the retirement of the 2009 Senior Notes recorded in 2007, lower interest expense as a result of the early redemption, in August 2008, of X.L. America, Inc.s 6.58% Notes and was partially offset by interest expense associated with the 10.75% Equity Security Units (the 10.75% Units) issued in August 2008. For more information on the Companys financial structure, see Liquidity and Capital Resources. Due to the financial market and economic events that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test for goodwill subsequent to its annual testing date of June 30. The interim impairment test resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $990.0 million. For further information, see Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and see further discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Amortization of intangible assets increased in 2008 as a result of the increase in intangible assets related to the XL GAPS acquisition in 2007. Amortization of intangible assets decreased in 2007 as a result of certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during 2006. The decrease in the Companys income taxes in 2009 as compared to 2008 arose principally from the decrease in the profitability of the Companys U.S. and European operations. The decrease in the Companys income taxes in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily a result of a change in the geographical locations of the profits earned primarily by the Companys U.S. and European operations, including the impact of losses associated with the Master Agreement and goodwill impairment charges related to operating entities in jurisdictions not subject to income tax. The Companys effective tax rate for 2008 differed as compared to 2007 mainly due to significant charges for which no tax benefit accrued and which resulted in a loss before tax. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Item 8, Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxation. Non controlling interest expense in 2007 related primarily to the 37% ownership interest in Syncora common shares held by the public prior to the secondary offering of Syncora common shares on June 6, 2007. Balance Sheet Analysis Investments The primary objectives of the investment strategy are to support the liabilities arising from the operations of the Company, generate stable investment income and build book value for the Company over the longer term. The strategy strives to balance investment returns against market and credit risks taken. The Companys investment portfolio is structured to take into account a number of variables including local regulatory requirements, business needs, collateral management and risk tolerance. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, total investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net receivable for investments sold were $35.9 billion and $34.3 billion, respectively. The following table summarizes the composition of the Companys invested assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008: 103 (U.S. dollars in thousands) Carrying value2009 (1) Percent ofTotal Carrying Value2008 (1) Percent ofTotal Cash and cash equivalents. $ 3,643,697 10.2 % $ 4,353,826 12.7 % Net receivable for investments sold 47,638 0.1 % 99,455 0.3 % Accrued investment income 350,055 1.0 % 363,376 1.1 % Short term investments 1,777,360 5.0 % 1,466,323 4.3 % Fixed maturities, available for sale: U.S. Government and Government Related/Supported 2,664,625 7.4 % 3,978,342 11.6 % Corporate 9,799,000 27.3 % 9,288,603 27.1 % Residential mortgage backed securities Agency 6,228,501 17.4 % 2,099,955 6.1 % Residential mortgage backed securities Non Agency 1,421,315 4.0 % 1,937,946 5.6 % Commercial mortgage backed securities 1,216,799 3.4 % 2,141,568 6.2 % Collateralized debt obligations 698,561 1.9 % 638,779 2.0 % Other asset backed securities 1,167,985 3.3 % 1,708,008 5.0 % U.S. States and political subdivisions of the States 913,473 2.5 % 468,770 1.4 % Non U.S. Sovereign Government, Supranational and Government Related 3,401,773 9.5 % 3,374,397 9.8 % Total fixed maturities. $ 27,512,032 76.7 % $ 25,636,368 74.8 % Fixed maturities, held to maturity 546,067 1.5 % % Equity securities 17,779 0.0 % 361,819 1.0 % Investments in affiliates 1,185,604 3.3 % 1,552,789 4.5 % Other investments 783,189 2.2 % 459,481 1.3 % Total investments and cash and cash equivalents $ 35,863,421 100.0 % $ 34,293,437 100.0 % (1) Carrying value represents the fair value for available for sale fixed maturities and amortized cost for held to maturity securities. The Company reviews on a regular basis its issuer concentration, credit quality and compliance with established guidelines. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the average credit quality of the Companys total fixed income portfolio (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) was AA. At December 31, 2009, approximately 55.2% of the fixed income portfolio (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net receivable for investments sold) was rated AAA by one or more of the principal ratings agencies. Approximately 3.5% of the fixed income portfolio was below investment grade or not rated. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, total investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net receivable for investments sold were $35.9 billion and $34.3 billion, respectively. This increase of $1.5 billion was primarily due to the mark to market effect as a result of the improving credit markets. Refer to Results of Operations for further discussion surrounding the impact of credit market movements on the Companys investment portfolio and exposure to sub prime related assets. Gross and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments At December 31, 2009, the Company had net unrealized losses on available for sale fixed maturities and short term investments of $1,276.3 million and net unrealized gains on equity securities of $5.4 million. Of these amounts, gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and short term investments and equities were $1,847.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the Company had net unrealized losses on fixed maturities and short term investments of $3,388.6 million and net unrealized gains on equity securities of $24.1 million. Of these amounts, gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and short term investments and equities were $4,122.3 million and $7.6 million, respectively. The impact of tightening credit spreads during the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was the primary reason for the improvement in the net unrealized position on fixed maturities and short term investments combined with net realized losses over the course of the year, offset by the impact of increasing government rates. The information shown below about the unrealized losses on the Companys investments at December 31, 2009 104 and 2008 may affect future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of these investments are other than temporary.

Management completed a strategic review of the Companys life reinsurance business, which are now in run off. The assets associated with that business are more heavily weighted towards longer term securities from financial institutions, including Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 securities, with a fair value of $0.7 billion representing committed term debt and hybrid instruments senior to the common and preferred equity of the financial institutions, and accounted for $175.9 million of the Companys net unrealized loss as at December 31, 2009. As at December 31, 2009, subordinated debt securities (including Lower Tier Two) had a fair value of $0.5 million and a net unrealized loss of $54.3 million. As at December 31, 2009 approximately 42.7% of the overall sensitivity to interest rate risk and 36.2% to credit risk was related to the Life investment portfolio, despite these portfolios accounting for only 19.0% of the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio. 106 The following table details the Companys structured credit exposures by certain asset classes as well as ratings levels within the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio and the current net unrealized gain (loss) position as at December 31, 2009 and 2008: (U.S. dollars in millions) As at December 31, 2009: Current Rating AAA AA A BBB BB & Below Total CMBS Fair value $ 1,033.0 $ 144.2 $ 21.0 $ 9.3 $ 15.5 $ 1,223.0 Net unrealized (loss) $ (23.3 ) $ (15.0 ) $ (7.0 ) $ (0.9 ) $ (11.8 ) $ (58.0 ) Prime RMBS Fair value $ 146.1 $ 86.7 $ 30.4 $ 46.4 $ 174.4 $ 484.0 Net unrealized (loss) $ (9.4 ) $ (28.8 ) $ (7.7 ) $ (7.7 ) $ (34.6 ) $ (88.2 ) Topical Assets (1) Fair value $ 101.7 $ 95.7 $ 98.2 $ 74.3 $ 367.7 $ 737.6 Net unrealized (loss) $ (24.6 ) $ (38.4 ) $ (73.1 ) $ (52.6 ) $ (293.7 ) $ (482.4 ) Core CDOs (2) Fair value $ 70.5 $ 146.2 $ 252.1 $ 77.2 $ 154.9 $ 700.9 Net unrealized (loss) $ (15.0 ) $ (34.2 ) $ (100.1 ) $ (39.7 ) $ (144.3 ) $ (333.3 ) Other Asset & Mortgage Backed Securities Fair value $ 811.4 $ 182.3 $ 256.2 $ 127.1 $ 33.2 $ 1,410.2 Net unrealized (loss) $ (15.9 ) $ (16.0 ) $ (15.4 ) $ (26.9 ) $ (25.9 ) $ (100.1 ) Agency RMBS Fair value $ 6,256.6 $ $ $ $ $ 6,256.6 Net unrealized gain $ 64.4 $ $ $ $ $ 64.4 Total Fair value $ 8,419.3 $ 655.1 $ 657.9 $ 334.3 $ 745.7 $ 10,812.3 Net unrealized (loss) $ (23.8 ) $ (132.4 ) $ (203.3 ) $ (127.8 ) $ (510.3 ) $ (997.6 ) As at December 31, 2008: CMBS Fair value $ 2,101.5 $ 15.2 $ 15.4 $ 11.8 $ 10.6 $ 2,154.5 Net unrealized (loss) $ (331.8 ) $ (5.1 ) $ (4.9 ) $ (7.7 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (361.9 ) Prime RMBS Fair value $ 752.6 $ 132.1 $ 57.1 $ 14.6 $ 36.3 $ 992.7 Net unrealized (loss) $ (218.8 ) $ (67.0 ) $ (45.5 ) $ (5.0 ) $ (13.0 ) $ (349.3 ) Topical Assets (1) Fair value $ 558.3 $ 183.7 $ 98.9 $ 48.0 $ 74.6 $ 963.5 Net unrealized (loss) $ (312.5 ) $ (157.5 ) $ (63.4 ) $ (24.7 ) $ (36.5 ) $ (594.6 ) Core CDOs (2) Fair value $ 166.1 $ 324.4 $ 51.7 $ 110.3 $ 13.7 $ 666.2 Net unrealized (loss) $ (61.7 ) $ (173.9 ) $ (46.6 ) $ (163.7 ) $ (24.1 ) $ (470.0 ) Other Asset & Mortgage Backed Securities Fair value $ 1,253.3 $ 108.1 $ 267.6 $ 61.7 $ 28.2 $ 1,718.9 Net unrealized (loss) $ (57.3 ) $ (18.3 ) $ (74.1 ) $ (28.9 ) $ (2.3 ) $ (180.9 ) Agency RMBS Fair value $ 2,109.8 $ $ $ $ $ 2,109.8 Net unrealized (loss) $ 63.1 $ $ $ $ $ 63.1 Total Fair value $ 6,941.6 $ 763.5 $ 490.7 $ 246.4 $ 163.4 $ 8,605.8 Net unrealized (loss) $ (919.0 ) $ (421.8 ) $ (234.5 ) $ (230.0 ) $ (88.3 ) $ (1,893.6 ) (1) Topical assets represent non agency RMBS securities with sub prime, Alt A, second lien or ABS CDO collateral.

Decreases in the ratings of such third party guarantors would typically decrease the fair value of guaranteed securities; however, at December 31, 2009, in the event of non performance at such date on the part of these third party guarantors, the Company estimated that the average credit quality of this portfolio would be A and that approximately 90.9% would have remained investment grade at such date. In addition, of the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio as at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, of $33.9 billion and $31.9 billion, respectively, less than 2% were guaranteed by such third parties with no individual third party representing more than 1%. In assessing these securities for other than temporary impairment, the Company reviews forecasted cash flows from the underlying collateral only, and does not assume that any payment will be made by these third party guarantors. At December 31, 2009, the Companys sub prime and Alt A exposures had adequate underlying loan characteristics and the Company believed at such date that they were supported by adequate subordination levels based on current expectations of house price declines, loss severities and default levels. The Company had approximately $696.8 million of Topical Assets downgraded during the year ended December 31, 2009. However, 50.1% of the Companys holdings remain rated investment grade at December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, liquidations necessary to fund the repayment of the GIC liabilities following the downgrade of Syncora Guarantee and the maturity of certain funding agreements were funded through sales of assets in the Other Financial Lines segment investment portfolios as well as the general investment portfolio. Managements approach was to avoid the sale of assets where current market prices did not reflect intrinsic values or where transaction costs for liquidation were excessive. As a result, the Company continues to hold Topical Assets and core CDOs, with a fair value of $1.4 billion which it has primarily transferred to the general portfolio. For a discussion on the significant drivers of the gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2009, please refer to Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Investments for further information. 108 The following table summarizes the fair value, gross unrealized losses, credit rating and asset class of securities in a gross unrealized loss position within the Companys structured credit and corporate portfolios, which comprised $1.7 billion of the Companys total gross unrealized loss position of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2009: (U.S. dollars in millions) Corporates AAA AA A BBB BB & Below Total Financials (1) Fair value $ 160.7 $ 280.5 $ 1,389.4 $ 474.7 $ 21.2 $ 2,326.5 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (8.4 ) $ (19.8 ) $ (215.5 ) $ (114.7 ) $ (9.2 ) $ (367.6 ) Non Financials (2) Fair value $ 24.3 $ 536.8 $ 1,267.7 $ 532.7 $ 174.8 $ 2,536.3 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (0.4 ) $ (30.5 ) $ (70.0 ) $ (94.5 ) $ (20.5 ) $ (215.9 ) Total Fair value $ 185.0 $ 817.3 $ 2,657.1 $ 1,007.4 $ 196.0 $ 4,862.8 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (8.8 ) $ (50.3 ) $ (285.5 ) $ (209.2 ) $ (29.7 ) $ (583.5 ) % Impaired (of amortized cost) (3) (4.6 )% (5.9 )% (9.9 )% (17.5 )% (13.4 )% (10.9 )% Structured Credit AAA AA A BBB BB & Below Total CMBS Fair value $ 623.2 $ 142.2 $ 14.7 $ 4.3 $ 9.1 $ 793.5 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (29.6 ) $ (15.4 ) $ (8.0 ) $ (1.3 ) $ (13.6 ) $ (67.9 ) Prime RMBS Fair value $ 133.7 $ 83.9 $ 25.6 $ 46.4 $ 166.6 $ 456.2 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (10.6 ) $ (29.4 ) $ (7.8 ) $ (7.7 ) $ (37.2 ) $ (92.7 ) Topical Assets Fair value $ 101.7 $ 88.2 $ 97.7 $ 67.6 $ 356.6 $ 711.8 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (24.6 ) $ (38.5 ) $ (73.1 ) $ (52.9 ) $ (295.9 ) $ (485.0 ) Core CDOs (4) Fair value $ 70.3 $ 146.2 $ 251.6 $ 77.0 $ 145.7 $ 690.8 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (15.0 ) $ (34.2 ) $ (100.1 ) $ (39.8 ) $ (153.1 ) $ (342.2 ) Other Asset & Mortgage Backed Securities Fair value $ 514.9 $ 137.9 $ 199.2 $ 110.5 $ 33.2 $ 995.7 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (26.4 ) $ (17.0 ) $ (16.7 ) $ (27.5 ) $ (36.2 ) $ (123.8 ) Agency RMBS Fair value $ 2,963.4 $ $ $ $ $ 2,963.4 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (37.9 ) (37.9 ) Total Fair Value $ 4,407.2 $ 598.4 $ 588.8 $ 305.8 $ 711.2 $ 6,611.4 Gross unrealized loss (3) $ (144.1 ) $ (134.5 ) $ (205.7 ) $ (129.2 ) $ (536.0 ) $ (1,149.5 ) % Impaired (of amortized cost) (3) (3.2 )% (18.4 )% (26.0 )% (29.8 )% (42.4 )% (14.7 )% (1) Included in the gross unrealized losses on corporate financials are gross unrealized losses of $225.2 million on Tier One and Upper Tier Two securities of financial institutions (Hybrids), as well as $84.3 million on subordinated debt.

(2) Included within Corporate are certain floating rate medium term notes supported primarily by pools of European credit with varying degrees of leverage. The notes have a fair value of $499.0 million and an amortized cost of $922.7 million. These notes allow the investor to participate in cash flows of the underlying bonds including certain residual values, which could serve to either decrease or increase the ultimate values of these notes. (3) Management considers these impairments to be temporary. (4) The Company defines Core CDOs as investments in non sub prime collateralized debt obligations, primarily consisting of collateralized loan obligations. Structured credit securities with gross unrealized losses representing greater than 50% of amortized cost account for $379.4 million of gross unrealized losses, with a fair value of $202.3 million. Of these gross unrealized losses, $112.0 million are rated investment grade. The Company has evaluated each of these holdings on a security by security basis in conjunction with its investment manager service providers and utilizing additional corroborative modeling techniques, and believes these securities will provide adequate principal and interest payments to satisfy the current amortized cost. These securities include $213.1 million 110 of Topical assets, $131.1 million of Core CDOs, $1.2 million of prime RMBS and $12.8 million of CMBS holdings. As noted in Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies, the determination of the amount of OTTI varies by investment type and is based upon managements periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects additional impairments in net income as determinations are made. Managements determination of the amount of the impairment taken on investments is highly subjective and could adversely impact the Companys results of operations. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of OTTI taken and reflected in the Companys financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. Levels of write down or OTTI are also impacted by the Companys assessment of the intent to sell securities which have declined in value. If, due to changes in circumstances, the Company determines to reposition or realign portions of the portfolio where the Company decides to sell certain securities in an unrealized loss position, then the Company will incur OTTI charges, which charges could be significant. Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities As disclosed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Fair Value Measurements, effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and has accordingly provided required disclosures by level within the fair value hierarchy of the Companys assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value. As defined in the hierarchy, those assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3 have valuations determined using unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs may include the entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions, applied to a modeled valuation, however, this is not the case with respect to the Companys Level 3 assets and liabilities. The vast majority of the assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 are made up of those securities for which the values were obtained from brokers where either significant inputs were utilized in determining the value that were difficult to corroborate with observable market data, or sufficient information regarding the specific inputs utilized by the broker were not obtained to support a Level 2 classification or the Company utilized internal valuation models. At December 31, 2009, certain assets which were previously classified as Level 3 assets due to a lack of observable market data are now classified as Level 2 assets due to sufficient market data now being available to determine a price and to allow the use of broker quotes. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company determined that for certain of its CDOs with a fair value of $483.2 million and a par value of $801.5 million, the Company considered the recent trading activity to be stressed transactions. The markets for CDOs had become extremely illiquid due to a number of factors including risk aversion and reduction of purchases among institutional buyers. As a result, the Company believed that broker bids reflected loss expectations that did not reflect fair values at which willing buyers and sellers would transact. The Company determined that internal models were more appropriate and better representative of the fair value at which these securities would be sold in an orderly market. As a result of numerous recent market factors, including increased volumes of trading, the Company believes that transactions in this market are no longer distressed and, accordingly, has reverted to third party vendor pricing sources where transactions are available as of December 31, 2009, and, where not available, broker quotes. Accordingly, as at December 31, 2009, for those CDOs which were previously valued using internal models, the Company now carries these assets at a fair value of $538.5 million and a par value of $789.1 million. Of these holdings, $457.6 million were valued by third party vendors and, accordingly, are now classified as Level 2, and $80.9 million were valued using broker quotations and, accordingly, remain classified as Level 3. 111 Controls over Valuation of Financial Instruments The Company performs quarterly reviews of the prices received from its third party valuation sources to assess if the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. This process is completed by investment and accounting personnel who are independent of those responsible for obtaining the valuations. The approaches taken to gain comfort include, but are not limited to, comparing valuations between external sources and completing recurring reviews of third party pricing services methodologies. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data, the price received from one third party may be substituted for another, or, in limited circumstances, management may determine that an adjustment is required to a third party value. In addition, similar valuation controls are followed by external parties responsible for sourcing appropriate valuations from third parties on the Companys behalf, which provides additional comfort over the reasonableness of the fair values recorded in the Companys financial statements. Valuation Methodology of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Refer to Notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies and Fair Value Measurements for a description of the valuation methodology utilized to value Level 3 assets and liabilities, how the valuation methodology is validated as well as further details associated with various assets classified as Level 3. As at December 31, 2009, the Company did not have any liabilities that were carried at fair value based on Level 3 inputs other than derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2009. Fair Value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities At December 31, 2009, the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities as a percentage of the Companys total assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Total Assets andLiabilities Carriedat Fair Value atDecember 31, 2009 Fair Value ofLevel 3 Assetsand Liabilities Level 3 Assetsand Liabilities asa Percentage ofTotal Assets andLiabilitiesCarried at FairValue, by class Assets Fixed maturities, at fair value U.S. Government and Government agency Related/Supported $ 2,664,625 $ % Corporate 9,799,000 10,311 0.1 % Residential mortgage backed securities Agency 6,228,501 7,894 0.1 % Residential mortgage backed securities Non Agency 1,421,315 42,190 3.0 % Commercial mortgage backed securities 1,216,799 2,755 0.2 % Collateralized debt obligations 698,561 190,663 27.3 % Other asset backed securities 1,167,985 38,179 3.3 % U.S. States and political subdivisions of the States 913,473 % Non U.S. Sovereign Government, Supranational and Government Related 3,401,773 3,217 0.1 % Total Fixed maturities, at fair value 27,512,032 295,209 1.1 % Equity securities, at fair value 17,779 % Short term investments, at fair value 1,777,360 6,486 0.4 % Total investments available for sale $ 29,307,171 $ 301,695 1.0 % Cash equivalents (1) 2,633,206 % Other investments (2) 417,589 75,584 18.1 % Other assets (3) 84,447 185,455 219.6 % Total assets carried at fair value $ 32,442,413 $ 562,734 1.7 % Liabilities Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (4) $ 36,979 $ % Other liabilities (5) 59,958 84,940 141.7 % Total liabilities carried at fair value $ 96,937 $ 84,940 87.6 % 112 (1) Cash equivalents balances subject to fair value measurements include certificates of deposit and money market funds. (2) The Other investments balance excludes certain structured transactions including certain investments in project finance transactions, a payment obligation (as described in Note 11, Other Investments), and has provided liquidity financing to a structured credit vehicle as a part of a third party medium term note facility. These investments are carried at amortized cost that totaled $365.6 million at December 31, 2009 and $94.8 million at December 31, 2008. (3) Other assets include derivative instruments, reported on a gross basis. (4) Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased are included within Net payable for investments purchased on the balance sheet. (5) Other liabilities include derivative instruments, reported on a gross basis. As at December 31, 2009, the balance of Level 3 assets as a percentage of the Companys total assets that were carried at fair value was 1.7%. The comparable percentage at December 31, 2008 was 4.5%. The decrease was primarily as a result of a change in the mix of assets during 2009. During 2009, the Company recorded the fair value of CDO holdings based upon pricing service valuations where available due to increased volumes of trading and increased new issuance of CDOs, resulting in transfers being recorded from Level 3 to Level 2. Changes in the Fair Value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Fair Value Measurements, for an analysis of the change in fair value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Unpaid losses and loss expenses reserves relate primarily to the casualty insurance and reinsurance business written by the Company. The balance was $20.8 billion at December 31, 2009, which is a decrease of $0.8 billion from December 31, 2008. The decrease was due primarily to favorable prior year reserve development reducing losses and loss expenses incurred during 2009 and the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. The table below presents a reconciliation of the Companys unpaid losses and loss expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Gross unpaidlosses and lossexpenses Unpaidlosses andloss expensesrecoverable Netunpaid lossesand lossexpenses Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 21,650,315 $ (3,964,836 ) $ 17,685,479 Losses and loss expenses incurred 3,990,455 (821,618 ) 3,168,837 Losses and loss expenses paid/recovered (1) (5,138,951 ) 1,263,016 (3,875,935 ) Foreign exchange and other 321,705 (33,953 ) 287,752 Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 20,823,524 $ (3,557,391 ) $ 17,266,133 (1) Includes paid losses relating to loss reserves associated with previous reinsurance agreements with Syncora that were settled as part of the Master Agreement. While the Company reviews the adequacy of established reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses regularly, no assurance can be given that actual claims made and payments related thereto will not be in excess of the amounts reserved. In the future, if such reserves develop adversely, such deficiency would have a negative impact on future results of operations. See Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Losses and Loss Expenses, for further discussion. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit the Companys losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its ultimate liability to the Companys insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on the balance sheet represent the Companys total unpaid gross losses. Unpaid losses and loss 113 expense recoverable relates to estimated reinsurance recoveries on the unpaid loss and loss expense reserves. Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverables were $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, reinsurance balances receivable were $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. The table below presents the Companys net reinsurance recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2009 and 2008: (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Reinsurance balances receivable $ 454,660 $ 636,284 Reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits 26,637 32,886 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 3,667,344 4,079,860 Bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (189,769 ) (187,614 ) Net paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable $ 3,958,872 $ 4,561,416 The Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due. Of the $4.0 billion total unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2009, one individual reinsurer accounted for 15% or more of the total. The Company is the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2009, collateralizing reinsurance recoverables with respect to certain reinsurers. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies. As at December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had a reserve for potential non recoveries from reinsurers of $189.8 million and $187.6 million, respectively. Approximately 88% of the total unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (excluding collateral held) outstanding at December 31, 2009, were due from reinsurers rated A or better by S&P. The following is an analysis of the total recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2009, by reinsurers owing more than 3% of such total: Name of reinsurer S&Ps rating % of total Munich Reinsurance Company AA /Stable 17.3% Swiss Reinsurance Company A+/Stable 10.9% Lloyds Syndicates A+/Stable 6.3% Swiss Re Europe S.A.

The Company would generally expect that positive cash flow from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most future loss scenarios. However, there is a possibility that unforeseen demands could be placed on the Company due to extraordinary events and as such the Companys liquidity needs may change. Such events include, among other things, several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time resulting in material incurred losses; rating agency downgrades of the Companys core insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries that would require posting of collateral, return of unearned premium and or the settlement of derivative transactions; large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables), etc. Any one or a combination of such events may cause a liquidity strain for the Company. In addition, a liquidity strain could also occur in an illiquid market, such as that which was experienced in 2008. Investments that may be used to meet liquidity needs in the event of a liquidity strain may not be liquid, given inactive markets, or may have to be sold at a significant loss as a result of depressed prices. Because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the consolidated group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. As a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. If such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, XL Capital Ltd may be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. A downgrade below A of the Companys principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by either S&P or A.M. Best, which is two notches below the current S&P financial strength rating of A (Negative) and the A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Stable) of these subsidiaries, may trigger cancellation provisions in a significant amount of the Companys assumed reinsurance agreements and may potentially require the Company to return unearned premiums to cedants. In addition, due to collateral posting requirements under the Companys letter of credit and revolving credit facilities, such a downgrade may require the posting of cash collateral in support of certain in use portions of these facilities. Specifically, a downgrade below A by A.M. Best would trigger such collateral requirements for the Companys largest credit facility. In certain limited instances, such downgrades may require the Company to return cash or assets to counterparties or to settle derivative and or other transactions with the respective counterparties. See Item 1, Business Ratings, for further information. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. Holding Company Liquidity As a holding company, XL Capital Ltd has no operations of its own and its assets consist primarily of its investments in its subsidiaries. Accordingly, XL Capital Ltds future cash flows largely depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries and states in which XL Capital Ltds subsidiaries operate, including, among others, Bermuda, New York, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. See Item 8, Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Statutory Financial Data, for further discussion and details regarding dividend capacity of the Companys major operating subsidiaries. See Risk Factors Risks Related to the Company because we are a holding company, if our subsidiaries do not make dividend and other payments to us, we may not be able to pay dividends or make payments on our debt securities and other obligations in Item 1A. The ability to pay such dividends is also limited by the regulations of the Society of Lloyds and certain contractual provisions. No assurance can be given that the Companys subsidiaries will pay dividends in the future to XL Capital Ltd. During 2009, management changed the internal ownership structure of certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries in Bermuda and Ireland in order to more efficiently utilize capital and to improve overall liquidity. In connection with these changes, certain dividends were paid to XL Capital Ltd by operating subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2009, the Holding Company, XL Capital Ltd, had cash and 115 investments of $1.5 billion compared to $0.1 billion at December 31, 2008 (net of liabilities associated with cash sweeping arrangements). XL Capital Ltds principal uses of liquidity are for dividend payments to holders of its ordinary shares and preferred shares, interest and principal payments on debt, capital investments in its subsidiaries and corporate operating expenses. XL Capital Finance (Europe) plc (XLFE) is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of the XL Capital Ltd. In January 2002, XLFE issued $600 million par value 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2012. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by XL Capital Ltd. The Company and its subsidiaries provide no guarantees or other commitments (express or implied) of financial support to the Companys subsidiaries or affiliates, except for such guarantees or commitments that are in writing. See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Sources of Liquidity for the Company As at December 31, 2009, the consolidated Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.6 billion as compared to approximately $4.4 billion at December 31, 2008. There are three main sources of cash flows for the Companythose provided by operations, investing activities and financing activities. Operating Cash Flows Historically, cash receipts from operations, consisting of premiums and investment income, generally have provided sufficient funds to pay losses as well as operating expenses of the Companys subsidiaries and to fund dividends to XL Capital Ltd. However, as a result of the combination of current soft market conditions, the decision to put the life segment and certain P&C lines into run off and lower investment yields, operating cash flows excluding extraordinary events are expected to be lower than prior years. Cash receipts from operations is generally derived from the receipt of investment income on the Companys investment portfolio as well as the net receipt of premiums less claims and expenses related to the Companys underwriting activities in its property and casualty operations as well as its Life Operations segment. The Companys operating subsidiaries provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to such premiums. Premiums and acquisition expenses are settled based on terms of trade as stipulated by an underwriting contract, and generally are received within the first year of inception of a policy when the premium is written, but can be up to three years on certain reinsurance business assumed. Operating expenses are generally paid within a year of being incurred. Claims especially for casualty business, may take a much longer time before they are reported and ultimately settled, requiring the establishment of reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses. Therefore, the amount of claims paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net losses incurred, as reported in the consolidated statement of income. During the year ended 2009, net cash flows used in operating activities were $42.8 million. This net cash outflow resulted primarily because lower premium levels did not offset the payment of claims. In addition, investment income during 2009 was significantly lower as a result of lower average invested balances and lower overall yields. During the year ended 2008, net cash flows used in operating activities were $427.3 million primarily as a result of the payment of approximately $1.8 billion to Syncora under the Master Agreement. The Company funded the payment to Syncora by using proceeds from the offering of both ordinary shares and ESUs, as well as from the proceeds received following the exercise by the Company of the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility as described below. Excluding the payment to Syncora, net cash flows from operations was approximately $1.3 billion in 2008. For the same period in 2007, net cash flows from operations was $2.2 billion. The decrease in net cash flow from operations, excluding the payment to Syncora, was primarily a result of decreases in net premiums written in the Companys P&C operations as described above and of lower net investment income related to both P&C operations and structured products mainly due to a lower asset base and changes in the portfolio mix following the sale of assets used to settle the GIC liabilities. In addition, yields earned on investment of cash flows and 116 reinvestment of maturing or sold securities have decreased, as prevailing market interest rates, in most major geographies, have decreased overall during the last twelve months. Total net paid losses were $3.9 billion in 2009 and $3.8 billion in each of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net losses incurred were $3.2 billion, $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Investing Cash Flows Generally, positive cash flow from operations and financing activities is invested in the Companys investment portfolio, including affiliates or acquisition of subsidiaries. Net cash provided by investing activities of $214.6 million in 2009 was mainly associated with normal purchase and sale of portfolio investments. During the year, the Company redeemed $441.5 million of alternative fund investments. Net cash provided by investing activities of $3.8 billion in 2008 was mainly associated with the sale and redemption of the Companys investments in fixed maturities, short term investments and equity securities. The sales of such securities exceeded related purchases, due mainly to the sale of assets used to settle the GIC liabilities and as a result of the Companys intention to reposition its investment portfolio and increase its holdings of cash as well as government agency holdings. Net cash used in investing activities in 2007 was primarily related to the purchase and sale of portfolio investments, with purchases of investments exceeding the related sales and redemptions. In addition, in 2007, the Company sold a portion of its interest in Syncora, through a secondary offering for $316.3 million. However, as a result of the sale and subsequent deconsolidation of Syncora, investing cash flows were reduced by $110.8 million. Certain of the Companys invested assets are held in trust and pledged in support of insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Such pledges are largely required by the Companys operating subsidiaries that are non admitted under U.S. state insurance regulations, in order for the U.S. cedant to receive statutory credit for reinsurance. In addition certain deposit liabilities and annuity contracts require the use of pledged assets. As at December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had $16.7 billion and $13.7 billion in pledged assets, respectively. Financing Cash Flows Cash flows related to financing activities include ordinary and preferred share related transactions, the payment of dividends, the issue or repayment of debt and deposit liability transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash flows used in financing activities were $962.6 million. Net cash outflows relate primarily to the repayment of debt and deposit liabilities and the payment of common and preferred dividends. Following the settlement of the purchase contracts associated with the 7.0% ESUs in February 2009, the Company issued 11,461,080 Shares for net proceeds of approximately $743.1 million, which was used to retire the senior notes previously due February 2011, which had a fixed coupon of 5.25%. On March 26, 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding Series C Preference Ordinary Shares that resulted in approximately 12.7 million Series C Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation value of $317.3 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $104.7 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, combined with professional fees totaling $0.8 million. As a result, a book value gain of approximately $211.8 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 to ordinary shareholders. In the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash flows used in financing activities was $2.8 billion. The main drivers for the cash outflow in 2008 are summarized below. In order to fund the payment of approximately $1.8 billion to Syncora under the Master Agreement and the payment of approximately $283 million to consummate the redemption of X.L. America, Inc.s 6.58% Notes, the Company raised approximately $2.8 billion in August 2008 through an issuance of both ordinary shares and ESUs. Concurrent with the execution of the Master Agreement, the Company exercised the put option under its Mangrove Bay contingent capital facility entered into in July 2003, resulting in net 117 proceeds to the Company of approximately $500 million in exchange for the issuance by the Company of 20,000,000 Series C Preference Ordinary Shares, par value U.S. $0.01 per share (the Series C Preference Shares). For further details on these transactions, see Capital Resources, below. In July 2008, in conjunction with the issuance of ordinary shares and ESUs described above, the Board of Directors approved a reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.19 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in September 2008. In addition, in February 2009, the Board of Directors approved a further reduction in the quarterly dividend payable on the Companys Class A Ordinary Shares to $0.10 per ordinary share beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in March 2009. As noted above, the Company settled during 2008 approximately $4.0 billion of GIC liabilities through the sale of certain assets from its fixed income portfolio. In addition, $1.2 billion of funding agreements were settled during 2008. At December 31, 2008, a significant component of the investments held in the Companys Other Financial Lines segment portfolios was comprised of Topical Assets and CDOs. Liquidations necessary to fund the repayment of the GIC liabilities following the downgrade of Syncora Guarantee and the maturity of certain funding agreements were funded through sales of assets in these portfolios as well as the general investment portfolios. Managements approach was to avoid the sale of assets where current market prices did not reflect intrinsic values or where transaction costs for liquidation were excessive. As a result, the Company continues to hold a number of the Topical Assets and CDOs, which were transferred to the general investment portfolio in exchange for those assets that were liquidated. At December 31, 2009, the remaining balance of funding agreements, excluding accrued interest of $6.5 million, was $450 million, with the full balance scheduled for settlement in August 2010. The Company continues to manage its liquidity needs through changes in the mix of its investment portfolio as well as through other available capital resources and lines of credit as noted below. In 2007, the Company repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of ordinary shares through its share repurchase programs and issued approximately $825.0 million of ordinary shares in connection with the maturity of the purchase contracts associated with the 6.5% Equity Security Units. In addition, the Company issued Series E preference ordinary shares for $1 billion and redeemed both its Series A and Series B preference ordinary shares for $230.0 million and $287.5 million, respectively. With regards to debt transactions in 2007, the Company purchased and retired the 2009 Senior Notes for $825.0 million in connection with the 6.5% Units and issued the 2027 Senior Notes for gross proceeds of approximately $324.4 million. In 2007, dividends paid were $274.0 million for ordinary shares and $69.5 million for preferred shares. In 2007, the Company paid out $360.0 million of net cash relating to deposit liability contracts. The Company is considered a Well Known Seasoned Issuer (WKSI) under the rules of the SEC. The Company maintains a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 and is eligible for automatically effective future registration statements for the potential offering and sale of an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities. The Registration Statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: (i) debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the Company, (ii) preferred securities of any of one or more capital trusts organized by the Company and guarantees of such securities by the Company and (iii) debt securities of XL Capital Finance (Europe) plc and guarantees of such securities by the Company. In addition the Company maintains letter of credit facilities which provide liquidity. Details of these facilities are described below in Capital Resources. Capital Resources At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had total shareholders equity of $9.4 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. In addition to ordinary share capital, the Company depends on external sources of financing to support its underwriting activities in the form of: a. debt; b. preference shares; c. contingent capital; and 118 d. letter of credit facilities and other sources of collateral. In particular, the Company requires, among other things: sufficient capital to maintain its financial strength and credit ratings, as issued by several ratings agencies, at levels considered necessary by management to enable the Companys key operating subsidiaries to compete; sufficient capital to enable its regulated subsidiaries to meet the regulatory capital levels required in the U.S., the U.K., Bermuda, Ireland, Switzerland and other key markets; letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are required to be posted or deposited, as the case may be, by the Companys operating subsidiaries that are non admitted under U.S. state insurance regulations in order for the U.S. cedant to receive statutory credit for reinsurance. The Company also uses letters of credit to support its operations at Lloyds; and revolving credit to meet short term liquidity needs. The following risks are associated with the Companys requirement to renew its credit facilities: the credit available from banks may be reduced resulting in the Companys need to pledge its investment portfolio to customers. This could result in a lower investment yield; the Company may be downgraded by one or more rating agencies which could materially and negatively impact the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity; and the volume of business that the Companys subsidiaries that are not admitted in the U.S. are able to transact could be reduced if the Company is unable to renew its letter of credit facilities at an appropriate amount. Continued consolidation within the banking industry may result in the aggregate amount of credit provided to the Company being reduced. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by identifying and or selecting additional banks that can participate in the credit facilities upon renewal. The following table summarizes the components of the Companys current capital resources at December 31, 2009 and 2008: (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Preferred share capital $ 1,182,673 $ 1,500,000 Ordinary share capital 8,432,417 5,116,831 Total Ordinary and Preferred capital $ 9,615,090 $ 6,616,831 Notes payable and debt 2,445,733 3,189,734 Total capital $ 12,060,823 $ 9,806,565 a) Ordinary Share Capital The following table reconciles the opening and closing common equity positions at December 31, 2009 and 2008: (U.S. dollars in thousands) December 31,2009 December 31,2008 Ordinary share equity beginning of period $ 5,116,831 $ 8,950,561 Net income (loss) attributable to XL Capital Ltd 74,991 (2,553,813 ) Share repurchases (626 ) (4,966 ) Share issues 741,291 2,388,561 Common share dividends (136,804 ) (261,464 ) Preferred share dividends (80,200 ) (78,645 ) Gain on redemption of Series C preference ordinary shares 211,816 Change in accumulated other comprehensive income 2,222,460 (3,374,086 ) Impact of adoption of new authoritative OTTI guidance, net of tax 229,670 Share based compensation and other 52,988 50,683 Ordinary equity end of period $ 8,432,417 $ 5,116,831 119 b) Debt The following tables present the Companys debt under outstanding securities and lenders commitments as at December 31, 2009: Notes Payable and Debt(U.S. dollars in thousands) Commitment/Debt In Use/Outstanding Year ofExpiry Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years After 5Years 5 year revolvers (1) $ 1,000,000 $ 2010/2012 $ $ $ $ 5 year revolver 100,000 2010 6.50% Guaranteed Senior Notes 600,000 599,350 2012 600,000 5.25% Senior Notes 600,000 596,933 2014 600,000 8.25% Senior Notes 575,000 575,000 2021 575,000 6.375% Senior Notes 350,000 350,000 2024 350,000 6.25% Senior Notes 325,000 324,450 2027 325,000 $ 3,550,000 $ 2,445,733 $ $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 1,250,000 In Use and Outstanding data represent December 31, 2009 accreted values.

In addition, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes Payable and Debt Financing Arrangements for further information. At December 31, 2009, banks and investors provided the Company and its subsidiaries with $3.5 billion of debt capacity, of which $2.4 billion was utilized by the Company. These facilities consist of: revolving credit facilities of $1.1 billion in aggregate. senior Unsecured Notes of approximately $2.4 billion. These notes require the Company to pay a fixed rate of interest during their terms. At December 31, 2009, there were five outstanding issues of senior unsecured notes: $600 million senior notes due January 2012, with a fixed coupon of 6.5%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at $99.469 and gross proceeds were $596.8 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $7.9 million. $600 million senior notes due September 2014, with a fixed coupon of 5.25%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued in two tranches of $300 million aggregate principal amount eachone tranche at 99.432% and the other at 98.419%. Aggregate gross proceeds were $593.6 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $4 million. $575 million of senior notes due August 2021, with a fixed coupon of 8.25%. These securities are a component of the 10.75% Units that are publicly traded. In addition to the coupon paid on the senior notes, quarterly contract adjustment payments at an annual rate of 2.50% per annum are paid on forward purchase contracts for the Companys common shares for a total distribution of 10.75% per annum. The purchase contracts mature in 2011, and the senior notes mature in 2021. In August 2011, the senior notes will be remarketed whereby the interest rate will be reset in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the 10.75% Unit holders obligations under the purchase contract. $350 million senior notes due November 2024, with a fixed coupon of 6.375%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at 100.0% and gross proceeds were $350 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $2 million. $325 million of senior notes due 2027, with a fixed coupon of 6.25%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at 99.805% and gross proceeds were $324.4 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $2.5 million. c) Preferred shares As at December 31, 2009 the Companys preferred share capital is made up of $1.0 billion Series E Preference ordinary shares and $182.7 million Series C Preference ordinary shares. As at December 31, 120 2008 the companys preferred share capital is made up of $1.0 billion Series E Preference ordinary shares and $500 million Series C Preference ordinary shares. On March 26, 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding Series C Preference Ordinary Shares that resulted in approximately 12.7 million Series C Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation value of $317.3 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $104.7 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, combined with professional fees totaling $0.8 million. As a result, a book value gain of approximately $211.8 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 to ordinary shareholders. In addition, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Share Capital for further information. d) Contingent Capital At December 31, 2009, the Company has one contingent capital transaction where the outstanding put option has not been exercised. No up front proceeds were received by the Company under this transaction. In the event that the associated irrevocable put option agreement is exercised, proceeds previously raised from investors from the issuance of pass through trust securities would be received in return for the issuance of preferred shares. See below for further details on this transaction. On December 5, 2006, the Company and certain operating subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into a securities issuance agreement (the Securities Issuance Agreement), and certain of the Companys foreign insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the Reinsurance Agreement), with Stoneheath Re (Stoneheath). The net effect of these agreements to the Company is the creation of a contingent put option to issue $350.0 million of preference ordinary shares in the aggregate. The agreements provide the Company with a Reinsurance Collateral Account in support of certain covered perils named in the Reinsurance Agreement. The covered perils include United States wind, European wind, California earthquake and terrorism worldwide. After an initial three month period, the covered perils as well as the attachment points and aggregate retention amounts may be changed by the Ceding Insurers in their sole discretion. This may result in a material increase or decrease in the likelihood of payment under the Reinsurance Agreement. On each date on which a Ceding Insurer withdraws funds from the Reinsurance Collateral Account, the Company shall issue and deliver to Stoneheath an amount of XL Capital Ltd Series D Preference Shares (the XL Preferred Securities) having an aggregate liquidation preference that is equal to the amount of funds so withdrawn from the Collateral Account. The Company is obligated to reimburse Stoneheath for certain fees and ordinary expenses. The initial term of the Reinsurance Agreement was for the period from the Closing Date through June 30, 2007, with four annual mandatory extensions through June 30, 2011 (unless coverage is exhausted thereunder prior to such date). The Ceding Insurers may thereafter extend the Reinsurance Agreement at their option for additional calendar quarters without limit (unless coverage is exhausted thereunder). The contingent put option is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The XL Preferred Securities, if issued, will pay dividends on a non cumulative basis at a fixed rate of 6.868% per annum through October 15, 2011 and thereafter at a floating rate based on 3 month LIBOR, plus 3.12%. e) Letter of Credit Facilities and other sources of collateral At December 31, 2009, the Company had six letter of credit facilities in place with total availability of $7.25 billion, of which $3.0 billion was utilized. Other Commercial Commitments(U.S. dollars in thousands) Commitment In Use Year ofExpiry Amount of CommitmentExpiration per period Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years After 5Years Letter of Credit Facility $ 250,000 143,591 Continuous Letter of Credit Facility (1) 2,250,000 2010 2,250,000 Letter of Credit Facility (1) 4,000,000 2,369,092 2012 4,000,000 Letter of Credit Facility 137 137 Continuous Letter of Credit Facility 93 93 Continuous Letter of Credit Facility 750,000 499,256 Continuous Six letter of credit facilities $ 7,250,230 $ 3,012,169 $ 2,250,000 $ 4,000,000 (1) Of the total letter of credit facilities above, $1 billion is also included in the revolvers under notes payable and debt. 121 In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedants. This could take the form of insurance trusts supported by the Companys investment portfolio or funds withheld (amounts retained by ceding companies to collateralize loss or premium reserves) using the Companys cash resources or combinations thereof. The face amount of letters of credit required is driven by, among other things, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business. In addition to letters of credit, the Company has established insurance trusts in the U.S. that provide cedants with statutory credit for reinsurance under state insurance regulation in the U.S. The Company reviews current and projected collateral requirements on a regular basis, as well as new sources of collateral. Managements objective is to maintain an excess amount of collateral sources over expected uses. The Company also reviews its liquidity needs on a regular basis. The following letter of credit facilities were originated, renewed or terminated during 2009: On December 14, 2009, the 450 million letter of credit facility issued on November 14, 2007 that was supporting the Companys syndicates at Lloyds of London terminated. This was replaced by a $750 million bilateral secured letter of credit facility. Covenants The Companys Credit Facilities contains a number of financial covenants that must be met and maintained, and that among other things, could restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our financial flexibility including the ability to: engage in mergers or consolidations; dispose of assets out with the ordinary course of business; create liens on assets; and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The following outlines the covenant requirements and actual amounts as of December 31, 2009: Covenant Requirement Actual Ratio orBalance atDecember 31, 2009 Margin of AdverseDevelopment fromDecember 31, 2009Levels Ratio of Total Funded Debt to Total Capitalization (1) Less than 0.35:1.00 0.19:1.00 $4.6 billion Maximum Secured Indebtedness (2) Less than 15% of consolidatednet worth 0% $1.6 billion Consolidated Net Worth (3) $6.4 billion $10.6 billion $4.2 billion Financial Strength Ratings (4) Better than B++ from A.M. Best A (stable) Two notch downgrade (1) The ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization not to be greater than 0.35:1.00. This ratio is defined as total funded debt to the sum of total funded debt plus consolidated net worth. (2) Secured indebtedness excludes secured letter of credit facilities as permitted under the schedules to the credit facilities. At December 31, 2009, such secured letter of credit facilities amounted to $642.8 million. (3) Consolidated net worth means, at any time, the consolidated stockholders equity of the Company excluding (a) the effect of any adjustments required under the authoritative accounting guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities; and (b) any exempt indebtedness (and the assets relating thereto) in the event such exempt indebtedness is consolidated on the consolidated balance sheet the Company. (4) Covenants require that, none of the XL Capital Group, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd or XL Re Ltd have financial strength ratings of less than A from A.M. Best. The financial strength ratings as at December 31, 2009 were XL Capital Group, A (Stable), XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd A (Stable) and XL Re Ltd A (Stable). As noted in the table above, at December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants by significant margins and the Company currently remains in compliance. 122 Cross Default and Other Provisions in Debt Instruments The following describes certain terms of the documents referred to below. All documents referred to below have been filed with the SEC and should be referred to for an assessment of the complete contractual obligations of the Company. In general, all of the Companys bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Companys outstanding indebtedness, including the credit facilities discussed above (collectively, the Companys Debt Documents), contain cross default provisions to each other and the Companys Debt Documents contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, among other things, minimum required ratings of the Companys insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries and the level of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generally each of the Companys Debt Documents provide for an event of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or some events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. A downgrade below A of the Companys principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by either S&P or A.M. Best, which is two notches below the current S&P financial strength rating of A (Negative) and the A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Stable) of these subsidiaries, may trigger cancellation provisions in a significant amount of the Companys assumed reinsurance agreements and may potentially require the Company to return unearned premiums to cedants. In addition, due to collateral posting requirements under the Companys letter of credit and revolving credit facilities, such a downgrade may require the posting of cash collateral in support of certain in use portions of these facilities (see Liquidity and Capital Resources). Specifically, a downgrade below A by A.M. Best would trigger such collateral requirements for the Companys two largest credit facilities. In certain limited instances, such downgrades may require the Company to return cash or assets to counterparties or to settle derivative and or other transactions with the respective counterparties. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. Under the Companys five year U.S. credit facilities, in the event that the XL Capital Group, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd and XL Re Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least A from A.M. Best, an event of default would occur. The 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes indenture contains a cross default provision. In general, in the event that the Company defaults in the payment of indebtedness in the amount of $50.0 million or more, an event of default would be triggered under the Guaranteed Senior Notes indentures. Given that all of the Companys Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due and payable and an acceleration of all debt due under those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness. Long Term Contractual Obligations The following table presents the Companys long term contractual obligations and related payments as at December 31, 2009, due by period. This table excludes further commitments of $134.4 million to the Companys related investment funds and certain limited partnerships, and letter of credit facilities of $3.0 billion. See Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments, and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. See Item 8, Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes Payable and Debt and Financing Arrangements, for further information. 123 Contractual Obligations(U.S. dollars in thousands) Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years Long term debt obligations $ 2,450,000 $ $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 1,250,000 Interest on long term debt 947,018 114,943 267,124 160,950 404,001 Contingent capital facilities 33,280 8,320 16,640 8,320 Equity Units 560,564 49,231 143,692 142,313 225,328 Operating lease obligations 208,596 32,639 57,418 44,286 74,253 Capital lease obligations 257,406 11,116 23,072 24,241 198,977 Deposit liabilities (1) 3,430,711 699,319 304,549 289,440 2,137,403 Future policy benefits (2) 9,017,957 384,095 752,287 769,523 7,112,052 Unpaid losses and loss expenses property and casualty operations (3) 21,218,196 4,368,764 5,799,231 3,474,695 7,575,506 Total $ 38,123,728 $ 5,668,427 $ 7,964,013 $ 5,513,768 $ 18,977,520 (1) Deposit liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 were $2,208,699. The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on payments due in the future. The payment related to these liabilities varies primarily based on interest rates. The ultimate payments associated with these liabilities could differ from the Companys estimate. See Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Deposit Liabilities, for further information. (2) Future policy benefit reserves related to Life operations were $5,490,119 on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. Amounts reflected above include an allowance for future premiums in respect of contracts under which premiums are payable throughout the life of the underlying policy. The value of the discount is also included for those lines of business that have reserves where future claim payments and future premium receipts can be estimated using actuarial principles. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments and premium receipts related to these reserves vary based on the underlying experience of the portfolio. Typical elements of the experience include mortality, morbidity and persistency. The ultimate amount of the claims payments and premium receipts could differ materially from the Companys estimated amounts. (3) The unpaid loss and loss expenses were $20,823,524 on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on payments due in the future for certain workers compensation lines. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments related to these P&C reserves vary based on many factors including large individual losses, changes in the legal environment, as well as general market conditions. The ultimate amount of the claims payments could differ materially from the Companys estimated amounts. For information regarding the estimates for unpaid loss and loss expenses as well as factors effecting potential payment patterns of reserves for actual and potential claims related the Companys different lines of business see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Certain lines of business written by the Company, such as excess casualty, have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns and, therefore, may impact the related asset/liability investment management process. In order to be in a position, if necessary, to make these payments, the Companys liquidity requirements are supported by having revolving lines of credit facilities available to the Company and significant reinsurance programs, in addition to the Companys general high grade fixed income investment portfolio. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) and Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At times, the Company has utilized VIEs both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of the Companys business. The Company invests in CDOs, and other investment vehicles that are issued through variable interest entities as part of the Companys investment portfolio. The activities of these VIEs are generally limited to holding the underlying collateral used to service investments therein. Our involvement in these entities is passive in nature and we are not the arranger of these entities. The Company has not been involved in establishing these entities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities as contemplated in current authoritative accounting guidance. The company has a limited number of remaining outstanding credit enhancement exposures including written financial guarantee and credit default swap contracts. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized through variable interest entities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities as contemplated in current authoritative accounting guidance. For further details on the nature of the obligations and the size of the companys maximum exposure see Note 2(r), Recent Accounting Pronouncements, and Note 17, Derivative Instruments. The Company has utilized variable interest entities in certain instances as a means of accessing contingent capital. The Company has utilized unconsolidated entities in the formation of contingent capital facilities. 124 On December 5, 2006, the Company and certain operating subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into a securities issuance agreement (the Securities Issuance Agreement), and certain of the Companys foreign insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the Reinsurance Agreement), with Stoneheath Re (Stoneheath). The net effect of these agreements to the Company is the creation of a contingent put option in the amount of $350.0 million in the aggregate. The Companys interests in Stoneheath represents an interest in a variable interest entity under current authoritative accounting guidance, however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary as contemplated in that guidance. Given that there are no contractual requirements or intentions to enter into additional variable interests in this entity; management considers the likelihood of consolidating Stoneheath in the future to be remote. The agreements provide the Company with a Reinsurance Collateral Account in support of certain covered perils named in the Reinsurance Agreement. The covered perils include United States wind, European wind, California earthquake and terrorism worldwide. After an initial three month period, the covered perils as well as the attachment points and aggregate retention amounts may be changed by the Ceding Insurers in their sole discretion. This may result in a material increase or decrease in the likelihood of payment under the Reinsurance Agreement. On each date on which a Ceding Insurer withdraws funds from the Reinsurance Collateral Account, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Issuer an amount of XL Capital Ltd Series D Preference Shares having an aggregate liquidation preference that is equal to the amount of funds so withdrawn from the Collateral Account. The Company is obligated to reimburse Stoneheath for certain fees and ordinary expenses. The initial term of the Reinsurance Agreement was for the period from the Closing Date through June 30, 2007, with four annual mandatory extensions thereafter through June 30, 2011 (unless coverage is exhausted there under prior to such date). The Ceding Insurers may thereafter extend the Reinsurance Agreement at their option for additional calendar quarters without limit (unless coverage is exhausted there under). The contingent put option is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The Stoneheath preferred securities and, if issued, the XL Series D Preference Shares will pay dividends on a non cumulative basis at a fixed rate of 6.868% per annum through October 15, 2011 and thereafter at a floating rate based on 3 month LIBOR, plus 3.12%.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and value at risk (VaR) analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of the Companys investment portfolio. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial and other instruments. The Company is principally exposed to the following market risks: interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk; equity price risk; credit risk; legacy weather and energy related risk, and other related market risks. For a discussion of related risks, see the risk factor titled We are exposed to significant capital markets risks related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and 126 foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in Item 1A Risk Factors, above. The Companys investment market risk arises from its investment portfolio which consists of fixed income securities, alternative investments, public equities, private investments, derivatives, other investments, and cash, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and other related market risks. The Companys fixed income and equity securities are classified as available for sale with the exception of certain Euro denominated Life assets, and as such, changes in interest rates, credit spreads on corporate and structured credit, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or other related market instruments will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income or loss and shareholders equity but may not have an immediate effect on net income. Changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and other related market instruments affect consolidated net income when, and if, a security is sold or impaired. The Company conducts its derivative activities primarily in investment related derivatives, which may include credit derivatives, and previously within weather and energy derivatives. From time to time, the Company uses investment derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of its investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. The Companys derivative transactions expose the Company to interest rate risk, credit derivative risk, weather and energy risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, equity risk, and other market risks. The Company attempts to manage these risks based on guidelines established by management and approved by the Finance Committee. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value with the resulting changes in fair value if not hedge accounted recognized in income in the period in which they occur. Credit derivatives are purchased within the Companys investment portfolio, have been sold through a limited number of contracts written as part of the Companys previous XLFS business, and were previously entered into through the Companys prior reinsurance agreements with Syncora. Following the closing of the Master Agreement, which terminated certain reinsurance and other agreements, these credit derivative exposures were eliminated by virtue of the commutation of the relevant reinsurance agreement. As of December 31, 2009, the remaining credit derivative exposure outside of the Companys investment portfolio consisted of 2 contracts written by the Company that provide credit protection on senior tranches of structured finance transactions with total insured contractual payments outstanding of $271.7 million ($244.9 million principal and $26.8 million interest), weighted average contractual term to maturity of 6.0 years, a total liability recorded of $18.4 million, and an average rating of AA on the underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2009, there have been no reported events of default on the underlying obligations. This risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and VaR analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of the Companys investment portfolio. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Interest Rate Risk The Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates generally would decrease the fair value of the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio, offset by the Companys ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates generally would increase the fair value of the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio, offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested. The Company manages interest rate risk within the context of its overall asset liability management strategy by setting duration targets for its investment portfolio in line with the estimated duration of its liabilities, thus mitigating the overall economic effect of interest rate risk. The Company remains nevertheless exposed to accounting interest rate risk since the assets are marked to market, thus subject to market conditions, while liabilities are accrued at a static rate. The hypothetical case 127 of an immediate 100 basis point adverse parallel shift in global bond curves as at December 31, 2009, would decrease the fair value of the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio by approximately 4.0% or $1.4 billion on both the Companys held to maturity and available for sale portfolios. Effective October 1, 2009, in connection with the run off of the Life investment portfolio, $546.1 million of Euro denominated government securities with an average duration of 14.1 years were designated as held to maturity, and the mark to market impact from those securities does not impact the Companys book value. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Many of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses arise for accounting purposes where net assets or liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the functional currency of those subsidiaries. While unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on underwriting balances are reported in earnings, the offsetting unrealized gains and losses on invested assets are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, to the extent that the asset currency does not match that entitys functional currency. This results in an accounting mismatch that will result in foreign exchange gains or loss in the consolidated statements of income depending on the movement in certain currencies. In order to improve administrative efficiencies as well as to address this accounting imbalance, the Company formed several branches with Euro and U.K. Sterling functional currencies during 2006, 2007 and 2008. Management continues to focus on attempting to limit this type of exposure in the future. Foreign currency exchange rate risk in general is reviewed as part of the Companys risk management process. Foreign exchange contracts within the investment portfolio are utilized to manage individual portfolio foreign exchange exposures, subject to investment management service providers guidelines established by management. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. These contracts generally have maturities of three months or less. The Company also attempts to manage the foreign exchange volatility arising on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These include, but are not limited to, premium receivable, reinsurance contracts, claims payable and investments in subsidiaries. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for the Company are the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Swiss Franc, and the Canadian dollar. The Companys net notional foreign currency denominated exposure on foreign exchange contracts was $859.7 million and $186.2 million as at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, with a net unrealized loss of $0.8 million and a net unrealized loss of $3.2 million as at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Equity Price Risk The Companys equity portfolio as well as certain derivatives and certain affiliate investments are exposed to equity price risk. Equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the market value of equities. An immediate hypothetical 10% change in the value of each equity position in the Companys equity portfolio would affect the fair value of the equity portfolio by approximately $1.2 million as at December 31, 2009. This excludes exposures to equities in the Companys affiliate investments. As at December 31, 2009, the Companys equity portfolio was approximately $12.0 million as compared to approximately $329.8 million as at December 31, 2008. This excludes fixed income fund investments and publicly traded alternative funds that generally do not have the risk characteristics of equity investments but do have some correlation to equity markets. As at December 31, 2009, the Companys allocation to equity securities was a negligible % of the investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net receivable (payable) for investments sold (purchased) as compared to approximately 1.1% as at December 31, 2008. For further discussion of the exposure to equity market movements in the Companys investment portfolio see the Investment Value at Risk (VaR) section below. 128 Credit Risk The Companys exposure in the investment portfolio to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads will increase the net unrealized loss position of the investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit derivatives where the Company assumes credit exposure, and, if issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an extended period of time, would likely result in higher other than temporary impairments. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of the Companys securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. The Companys exposure to market movements related to credit risk is primarily due to its investment portfolio, receivable and ceded reinsurance balances. Within the investment portfolio, credit risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the creditworthiness of individual investment holdings, issuers, groups of issuers, industries or countries. The credit spread duration representing the average percentage increase (decrease) in the Companys fixed income portfolio resulting from a 100 bp spread decline (increase) evenly across all credit markets is 3.6 years at December 31, 2009 as compared to 3.2 years at December 31, 2008. The increase in 2009 is as a result of purchases of spread products such as Agency RMBS, offset by the cumulative effects of the 2009 derisking efforts. The hypothetical case of an immediate 25 basis point increase in all the global corporate and structured credit spreads to which the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio is exposed to at December 31, 2009 would decrease the fair value of the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio by approximately $251.0 million. This excludes exposure to credit in the Companys alternative investments. In addition, credit risk pertains to adverse change in the creditworthiness of the Companys reinsurers and retrocessionaires, and their ability to pay certain reinsurance receivable and recoverable balances. The Company manages credit risk in the investment portfolio, including fixed income, alternative and short term investment through the credit research performed primarily by the investment management service providers and limitations on the investment portfolios exposure to individual credits. Credit limits for corporate exposures are based on an internal model that allows the limits to be linked to the Companys balance sheet credit risk taking capacity while also taking into consideration internal views on specific issuers and on current or expected market credit conditions. Credit limits for other sectors are derived from the corporate limits using multipliers as a way to quantify intrinsic credit quality characteristics differences with the corporate sector. Limits are reviewed regularly and ensure that potential losses from individual defaults should not exceed predetermined levels. In the investment portfolio, the Company reviews on a regular basis its issuer concentration, credit quality and compliance with established credit limits. Any issuer over its credit limits, experiencing financial difficulties, material credit quality deterioration or potentially subject to forthcoming credit quality deterioration is placed on a watch list for closer monitoring. Where appropriate, exposures are reduced or prevented from increasing. The Company has also developed a proprietary model for the investment portfolio to assess corporate credit risk based upon its individual holdings mark to market exposure, credit rating, seniority in the capital structure, migration and default probabilities, durations, default correlations and loss severity given a default event. Based upon these factors and related market based inputs, the Company can estimate the credit risk of the Companys corporate portfolio and its various components. Assumptions are reviewed regularly to ensure the risk estimates are reasonable and reflect underlying exposures. The table below shows the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio by credit rating in percentage terms of the Companys aggregate fixed income exposure (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) as at December 31, 2009. 129 Percentage of AggregateFixed Income Portfolio AAA 55.2 AA 15.6 A 18.7 BBB 7.0 BB & below 3.5 NR 0.0 Total 100.0 % At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the average credit quality of the Companys aggregate fixed income investment portfolio was AA, excluding operating cash.

The Companys $10.5 billion portfolio of corporates is rated A. The Companys $10.8 billion structured credit portfolio is A+ rated.

Credit derivatives are purchased within the Companys investment portfolio, have been sold through a limited number of contracts written as part of the Companys previous XL Financial Solutions business, and were previously entered into through the Companys prior reinsurance agreements with Syncora, as described below. From time to time, the Company may purchase credit default swaps to hedge an existing position or concentration of holdings. The credit derivatives are recorded at fair value. Following the secondary sale of Syncora common shares, the Company retained some credit derivative exposures written by Syncora and certain of its subsidiaries through reinsurance agreements that had certain derivatives exposures embedded within them. Following the closing of the Master Agreement which terminated certain reinsurance and other agreements, these credit derivative exposures were eliminated by virtue of the commutation of the relevant reinsurance agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the remaining credit derivative exposure outside of the Companys investment portfolio consisted of 23 contracts written by the Company that provide credit protection on senior tranches of structured finance transactions with total net par values outstanding of $639.5 million, a weighted average contractual term to maturity of 5.7 years, a total liability recorded of $28.6 million, and an average rating of AA on the underlying obligations. As of December 31, 2009, there have been no reported events of default on the underlying obligations. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, alternatives and other investment funds and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the Companys counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure that is due. The Company also has exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions, revolving credit facility and letter of credit commitments and equity investments. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. With regards to unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable, the Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due to the Company; however, these exposures are not marked to market. For further information relating to reinsurer credit risk, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable. 132 The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the other parties to its derivative instruments in general; however, the Company does not anticipate non performance. The difference between the notional principal amounts and the associated market value is the Companys maximum credit exposure. Other Market Risks The Companys private investment portfolio is invested in limited partnerships and other entities which are not publicly traded. In addition to normal market risks, these positions may also be exposed to liquidity risk, risks related to distressed investments, and risks specific to startup or small companies. As at December 31, 2009, the Companys exposure to private investments, excluding unfunded commitments, was $324.1 million representing 1.0% of the fixed income portfolio compared to $404.8 million as at December 31, 2008. The Companys alternative investment portfolio, which is exposed to equity and credit risk as well as certain other market risks, had a total exposure of $800.2 million making up approximately 2.4% of the investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net payable for investments purchased) at December 31, 2009, as compared to December 31, 2008, where the Company had a total exposure of $1.1 billion representing approximately 3.2% of the investment portfolio. The VaR associated with the alternative investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 was approximately $60.5 million using proxy indices. For further discussion of the VaR of the Companys investment portfolio see the Investment Value at Risk section below. At December 31, 2009, bond and stock index futures outstanding had a net long position of $81.8 million as compared to a net long position of $101.7 million at December 31, 2008. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the underlying exposure to these derivative instruments would have resulted in realized gains or realized losses of $8.2 million as at December 31, 2009 and $10.2 million as at December 31, 2008, respectively. The Company may reduce its exposure to these futures through offsetting transactions, including options and forwards. Investment Value at Risk (VaR) Central to the Companys market risk management framework for Investments is VaR. VaR is a statistical risk measure, calculating the level of potential losses that could be expected to be exceeded, over a specified holding period and at a given level of confidence, in normal market conditions, due to adverse movements in the investment portfolios underlying securities and investments valuations. The Company uses VaR as a statistical risk measure of the two principal components of its investment portfolio: 1) Property and casualty (P&C) investment portfolio: The largest component of the investment portfolio is the P&C investment portfolio and its principal objective is to support the Companys insurance and reinsurance operations, the liabilities of which have some uncertainty as to the timing and or amount. In addition, a smaller portion of the P&C investment portfolio supports run off financial businesses (Structured Indemnity and Other Financial Lines), in which the liabilities have a greater level of certainty. 2) The Life investment portfolio: The principal objective of the Life investment portfolio is to support the Companys life operations, which are now in run off. The largest portion of the Life investment portfolio supports the policy benefit reserves associated with asset annuity transactions, with limited uncertainty as to the timing or amount of the liability cash flows. A smaller portion of the Life investment portfolio supports life annuity liabilities that were assumed without portfolio asset transfer. The Company calculates the VaR of the investment portfolio, the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio, using a one year holding period and a 95% level of confidence. This means that, on average, the Company could expect marked to market results greater than predicted by the VaR results 5% of the time, or once every 20 years. The calculation of VaR is performed monthly using an analytical, or variance covariance approach, based on the linear sensitivity of the investment portfolio and individual securities to a broad set of systematic market risk factors and idiosyncratic risk factors. The Company computes the parametric sensitivity of every security in the investment portfolio to changes in key interest rates, spreads, implied volatility, equities, and foreign exchange rates. The parametric exposures are summed 133 using the appropriate investment portfolio weights to compute the investment portfolios exposure to these systematic and idiosyncratic market risk factors. Results for the investment portfolio are expressed both in terms of U.S. dollars and as a percentage of the Companys investment portfolio. Results for the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio are expressed both in terms of U.S. dollars and as a percentage of the Companys P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio, respectively. As part of the Companys ongoing initiatives to enhance its risk reporting activities, the Company expanded its modeling capabilities and analytics to measure the VaR of the investment portfolio, P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio, excluding the foreign exchange rate risk within the portfolios. Within its asset liability framework for the investment portfolio, the Company pursues a general policy of holding the assets and liabilities in the same currency and as such the Company is not exposed to the risks associated foreign exchanges movements within the investment portfolio, as currency impacts on the assets are generally matched by corresponding impacts on the related liabilities, and accordingly are neutral to the Companys book value. The Company considers that the investment portfolio VaR, P&C investment portfolio VaR and Life investment portfolio VaR, results excluding foreign exchange rate risk are the more relevant and appropriate metrics to consider when assessing the actual risk of the portfolios. The modeling of the risk of any portfolio, as measured by VaR, involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While the Company believes that its assumptions and approximations are appropriate, there is no uniform industry methodology for calculating VaR. The Company notes that different VaR results can be produced for the same portfolio dependent not only on the approach used but also on the assumptions employed when implementing the approach. The VaR approach uses historical data to determine the sensitivity of each of the underlying securities to the risk factors incorporated into the pricing models employed in the VaR calculations. In calculating these sensitivities, greater importance is placed on the more recent data points and information. Since the VaR approach is based on historical positions and market data, VaR results should not be viewed as an absolute and predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for the Company to predict risk. There is no assurance that the Companys actual future losses will not exceed its VaR and the Company expects that 5% of the time the VaR will be exceeded. Additionally, the Company acknowledges the fact that risks associated with abnormal market events can be significantly different from the VaR results and these are by definition not reflected or assessed in the VaR analysis, rather this is evaluated using the Companys stress testing framework. The VaR of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 was approximately $1.8 billion including foreign exchange rate risk and $1.4 billion excluding foreign exchange rate risk. The VaR of all investment related derivatives excluding investments in affiliates and other investments was approximately $44.5 million. In instances where the data or time series are insufficient to determine the risk factor sensitivities, the VaR approach uses proxy time series data available for similar instruments. As at December 31, 2009, approximately $5.2 billion used proxy time series data. Approximately $1.3 billion related to various fixed income portfolios (of which $337.3 million was in mortgage backed and asset backed securities), $2.4 billion to various cash portfolios, $800.2 million to alternative investments, $319.6 million to private investments, $10.5 million to equity portfolios, and ($6.6 million) to derivatives. The Company reviews the proxies to ensure that an appropriate data and time series is being used in the calculations. For $485.3 million related to strategic investments, proxy time series data was not available and accordingly risk results were not modelled. The following tables show the Companys average, minimum and maximum VaR in percentage and dollar terms for the investment portfolio, P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2009, based upon the VaR at quarter end dates excluding foreign exchange rate risk, and the Companys VaR in percentage and dollar terms, respectively, for the investment portfolio as at December 31, 2009. The Companys investment portfolio VaR, P&C investment portfolio VaR and Life investment portfolio VaR as at December 31, 2009 is not necessarily indicative of future VaR levels. 134 Average VaR% VaR (1) Minimum VaR% VaR (1) Maximum VaR% VaR (1) At December 31,2009% VaR (1) P&C investment portfolio VaR 4.20 % 3.19 % 5.12 % 3.19 % Life investment portfolio VaR 10.61 % 9.07 % 13.64 % 9.76 % Undiversified VaR (2) 5.33 % 4.37 % 6.52 % 4.37 % Diversification VaR (3) 0.52 % N/A % N/A % 0.39 % Investment portfolio VaR (4)(5) 4.81 % 3.98 % 5.64 % 3.98 % (U.S. dollars in millions) Average VaRduring 2009$VaR (6) Minimum VaRduring 2009$VaR (6) Maximum VaRduring 2009$VaR (6) VaR asat December 31,2009$VaR (6) P&C investment portfolio VaR (7) $ 1,148.7 $ 931.2 $ 1,357.1 $ 931.2 Life investment portfolio VaR (7) $ 627.6 $ 598.3 $ 688.8 $ 622.8 Investment portfolio VaR (4)(5) $ 1,604.7 $ 1,415.0 $ 1,802.4 $ 1,415.0 (1) Based on a 95% confidence level with a one year holding period, excluding foreign exchange rate risk as described above. Results for the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio are expressed as a percentage of the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio market values, respectively. Results for the investment portfolio, Undiversified VaR and Diversification VaR are expressed as a percentage of the investment portfolio market value. (2) Average Undiversified VaR for the year ended December 31, 2009 and Undiversified VaR at December 31, 2009 is the market value weighted summation of the individual VaRs for the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio and, by construction, ignores any and all correlations between these portfolios (and their underlying asset classes). The Undiversified VaR therefore ignores diversification benefits that exist in between these portfolios (and their respective underlying asset classes). Maximum and Minimum Undiversified VaR is not necessarily the summation of the individual VaRs for each of the separate portfolios since the Maximum and Minimum VaR and the Maximum and Minimum Undiversified VaR do not necessarily refer to the same point in time. (3) Diversification VaR equals the difference between the investment portfolio VaR and the Undiversified VaR. As the former explicitly accounts for the correlations and diversification benefits that exist between the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio and the latter explicitly does not, the difference in the two VaR results is due to the diversification benefits. These diversification benefits arise due to the risk reduction that occurs when different assets, that are not perfectly correlated, are combined in a portfolio. It will vary over time dependent on: changes in allocations; changes in the correlations between the different underlying asset classes; and changes in the underlying asset class risks. The NA reflects the fact that, since the Minimum and Maximum VaR do not refer to the same point in time, it is therefore not meaningful to calculate the Diversification VaR. (4) Investment portfolio VaR is based on the prescribed methodology that explicitly accounts for the diversification benefits that occur when each of the allocations to the P&C investment portfolioand Life investment portfolio (and their underlying asset classes) are included in the investment portfolio. (5) Investment portfolio refers to the aggregate of the two main components of the Companys investment portfolio the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio. (6) Based on a 95% confidence level with a one year holding period, expressed in millions of U.S. Dollars. (7) P&C investment portfolio VaR and Life investment portfolio VaR are based on the prescribed VaR methodology applied separately and independently to the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio, respectively. The VaR results take into account the risk and diversification benefits associated with the actual underlying securities, asset classes and allocations held in the P&C investment portfolio and Life investment portfolio respectively. The Companys investment portfolio VaR is driven by: the size and duration of the overall investment portfolio; the size of the allocations to the different asset classes and securities in the asset classes; the risks associated with each of the asset classes and securities; and the correlations and diversification benefits between each of the asset classes and securities. Changes in any of these variables will have a direct impact on the Companys VaR. Stress Testing VaR does not provide the means to estimate the magnitude of the loss in the 5% of occurrences when the Company expects the VaR level to be exceeded. To complement the VaR analysis based on normal market environments, the Company considers the impact on the investment portfolio in several different historical stress periods to analyze the effect of unusual market conditions. The Company establishes certain historical stress test scenarios which are applied to the actual investment portfolio. As these stress tests and estimated gains and losses are based on historical events, they will not necessarily reflect future stress events or gains and losses from such events. The results of the stress test scenarios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they are appropriate, based on current shareholders equity, market conditions and the 135 Companys total risk tolerance. It is important to note that when assessing the risk of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company does not take into account either the value or risk associated with the liabilities arising from the Companys operations. The table below shows the maximum impact on the Companys investment portfolio excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates if all events stress tested were to repeat themselves, given the actual investment portfolios allocations at the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2009. The Company assumes that no action is taken during the stress period to either liquidate or rebalance the portfolio. The Company believes that this fairly reflects the potential decreased liquidity that is often associated with stressed market environments. Stress Test March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 Maximum loss impact on investment portfolio (3.6 )% (5.0 )% (5.2 )% (3.8 )% Maximum gain impact on investment portfolio 11.6 % 12.6 % 11.6 % 11.7 % Given the investment portfolio allocations as at December 31, 2009, the Company would expect to lose approximately 3.8% of the investment portfolio if the most damaging event stress tested representing the period from September 2008 to November 2008 surrounding the Lehman bankruptcy was repeated, all other things held equal. Given the investment portfolio allocations as at December 31, 2009, the Company would expect to gain approximately 11.7% of the investment portfolio if the most favorable event stress tested, representing the bond market rally from May 2000 to June 2003 was repeated, all other things held equal. 136
