The Company operates in markets where it believes its underwriting expertise and financial strength represent a relative advantage. The Company has grown through acquisitions and development of new business opportunities. Acquisitions included Global Capital Re in 1997, Mid Ocean Limited in 1998, ECS, Inc. and NAC Re Corp. in 1999, Winterthur International in 2001 and Le Mans Re in 2002. All acquisitions were entered into in order to further support the Companys strategic plan to develop a global platform in insurance and reinsurance. The Company competes as an integrated global business and at December 31, 2011 employed 3,818 employees in 24 countries. For further information in relation to the Companys Operations, see Item 1, Business. Impact of Recent Natural Catastrophes In 2011, the global insurance and reinsurance markets experienced significant losses from natural catastrophes, including the 2011 flooding events in Australia (the Australia floods), the earthquake that struck Christchurch, New Zealand on February 22, 2011 (the New Zealand earthquake), the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan (the Japan earthquake and tsunami), the severe weather occurrences, including tornado activity, in the United States over the periods April 22 28 and May 20 23, 2011 (the U.S. Storms), third quarter Atlantic storm activity, particularly Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee (the Atlantic Hurricanes) and the widespread flooding in Thailand that reached its highest point during the fourth quarter (the Thailand floods). See Significant Items Affecting Results of Operations 1) The impact of significant large natural catastrophe activity below for a discussion of the Companys loss estimates for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 from natural catastrophes. Underwriting Environment The Company earns its revenue primarily from net premiums written and earned. The property and casualty insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, meaning that based on market conditions, there have been periods where premium rates are high and policy terms and conditions are more favorable to the Company (a hard market) and there have been periods where premium rates decline and policy terms and conditions are less favorable to the Company (a soft market). Market conditions are driven primarily by competition in the marketplace, the supply of capital in the industry, investment yields and the frequency and severity of loss events. Managements goal is to build long term shareholder value by capitalizing on current opportunities and managing through any cyclical downturns by reducing its property and casualty book of business and exposures if and when rates deteriorate during soft market periods. Insurance Underwriting Environment The trading environment for the core lines of insurance business written by the Company remains difficult as competitive pressures continue, although there have been signs of improvement during the second half of 2011. The Company continues its disciplined underwriting approach to grow on a very selective basis and exit lines where margins are unacceptable. Overall, retention ratios have continued to improve while premium rates were broadly flat for the year. The Insurance segment experienced rate increases in the North America P&C and Specialty lines which were offset by declines in the highly competitive U.S. professional lines while the International P&C line was effectively flat for the year. The Company continues to develop new business opportunities in several areas, including its North American construction and surety businesses, which were announced in 2010 and its political risk and North America inland marine businesses, which were announced during the fourth quarter of 2011. Geographic expansion also continues with the opening of an office in China in April 2011 and the recent approval from the Brazilian regulators to expand the Companys presence there complementing the Reinsurance operation with an Insurance segment branch offering Casualty, Property, Professional and Specialty products. Reinsurance Underwriting Environment The January 1 renewals for the Reinsurance segment saw positive pricing across the catastrophe books of business and certain Specialty lines, while Casualty rates overall were broadly flat. U.S. D&O continued to show rate deterioration in this very competitive line of business. Given the level of global catastrophe losses this year, both loss impacted and non loss impacted programs in the U.S. and International books of business experienced significant rate increases, particularly in International, while the increases on European catastrophe books were more modest, in the single digit percentages. The following sets forth potential trends relevant to the Companys property and casualty operations: 53 2012 Underwriting Outlook Throughout 2009 and 2010, the Company was focused on selective growth initiatives, emphasizing short tail lines, where applicable, in the Companys reinsurance operations, exiting other businesses, such as Casualty facultative business and non renewing certain insurance programs, as well as continuing to reduce long term agreements within the insurance operations in order to take advantage of improvements in market conditions when and where they occur. In 2011, while several of these initiatives continued, the Company also shifted its focus to concentrate on strategic growth and investment in areas where the Company believes it can achieve appropriate future returns. Recent strategic growth initiatives included the continued expansion of the U.S. construction and surety lines, the addition of political risks and North America inland marine businesses, new innovative products, including further build out of a product recall policy for the food and beverage industry, the establishment of a Middle East team in the U.K. and an Accident and Health team in the U.S., and the continued move into emerging markets, including China and Brazil. The Company also made significant investment in 2011 to improve systems to both achieve greater efficiency and to create a platform from which the Company can grow as markets allow. In 2012 and beyond, this focus on strategic growth and investment will continue. The following is a summary of the January 2012 rate indications and recent renewal activity for each of the Insurance and Reinsurance segments of the Company: Insurance 2012 Underwriting Outlook With regard to market conditions, within the Insurance segments core lines of business, fourth quarter and full year 2011 renewals reflected broadly flat premium rates in aggregate, however, there were several favorable signs of improvement. For the third consecutive quarter, the segment experienced positive pricing in its North America P&C business unit at an increase of 2%. Specialty pricing was also positive for the year at 2% and there was material improvement in the U.S. D&O book during the fourth quarter as rate decreases slowed and certain 2012 renewals are yielding rate increases. For the year the segment experienced percentage rate decline in the low single digits. The Company continues to focus on those lines of business that it believes provide the best return on capital, including the writing of selective new business and remaining committed to the underwriting actions initially taken in 2009. For 2012, initial indications are consistent with current market conditions described above. In the International P&C business unit, where nearly 40% of the book renews on January 1, the Companys initial pricing indications are broadly stable. Casualty rates were flat to slightly down and property rates were showing increases in the low to mid single digits. Reinsurance 2012 Underwriting Outlook As noted above, the pricing environment on the primary side is showing rate growth with the exception of Professional lines. This generally positive pricing momentum should benefit the U.S. and International casualty books where a significant amount of proportional reinsurance is written. In addition, the Reinsurance segment continues to develop new business opportunities in several areas, including in an improving U.K. motor market pricing environment, and in marine and energy following Deepwater Horizon and other recent industry loss events in these lines. For 2012, the Reinsurance segment expects to continue to build upon the strategic growth achieved in 2011 and will utilize the Companys broad market relationships and experience to seek opportunities to achieve this. There can be no assurance, however, that such (re)insurance rate conditions or growth opportunities will be sustained or further materialize, or lead to improvements in our books of business. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Investment Environment The Company seeks to generate income and book value growth from investment activities through returns on its investment portfolio. The Companys current investment strategy seeks to support the liabilities arising from the operations of the Company, generate investment income and build book value over the longer term. During the year ended December 31, 2011, interest rates declined in the Companys major markets and credit spreads widened, particularly in the Euro zone. The Companys results of operations and investment portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2011 were impacted by these trends. Net investment income yields were negatively impacted by lower interest rates which in turn reduced prevailing yields on reinvestment income. Net realized losses resulted from sales transactions primarily on European financials including hybrid securities and non Agency RMBS offset partially by gains on Agency MBS and Government and Government Related and Supported securities. The impact of decreasing government rates offset by widening credit spreads during the year ended December 31, 2011 was the primary reason for the improvement in the net unrealized position on fixed maturities and short term investments over the course of the year. For further information, see Investment Activities below. 54 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES Results of Operations The following table presents an analysis of the Companys net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders and other financial measures (described below) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders $ (474,760 ) $ 585,472 $ 206,607 Earnings (loss) per ordinary share basic $ (1.52 ) $ 1.74 $ 0.61 Earnings (loss) per ordinary share diluted $ (1.52 ) $ 1.73 $ 0.61 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents basic 312,896 336,283 340,612 Weighted average number of ordinary shares and ordinary share equivalents diluted 312,896 337,709 340,966 Key Financial Measures The following are some of the financial measures management considers important in evaluating the Companys operating performance in the Companys P&C operations: (U.S. dollars in thousands, except ratios and per share amounts) 2011 2010 2009 Underwriting profit P&C operations $ (397,353 ) $ 262,494 $ 327,306 Combined ratio P&C operations 107.5 % 94.8 % 93.6 % Net investment income P&C operations (1) $ 819,708 $ 884,866 $ 987,398 Book value per ordinary share (2) $ 29.85 $ 30.37 $ 24.64 Fully diluted book value per ordinary share (3) $ 29.64 $ 29.78 $ 24.60 Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (4) (5.0 )% 6.5 % 3.1 % (1) Net investment income relating to P&C operations includes the net investment income related to the net results from structured products. (2) Book value per ordinary share, a non GAAP financial measure, is calculated by dividing ordinary shareholders equity (total shareholders equity less preference shareholders equity and non controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries) by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end. Book value per ordinary share is affected primarily by the Companys net income (loss), by any changes in the net unrealized gains and losses on its investment portfolio, currency translation adjustments and also the impact of any share buyback or issuance activity. Ordinary shareholders equity was $9.43 billion, $9.61 billion and $8.43 billion and the number of ordinary shares outstanding was 315.7 million, 316.5 million and 342.1 million at December 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Ordinary shares outstanding include all ordinary shares legally issued and outstanding (as disclosed on the face of the balance sheet) as well as all director share units outstanding. (3) Fully diluted book value per ordinary share, a non GAAP financial measure, represents book value per ordinary share combined with the dilutive impact of potential future share issuances at period end. The Company believes that fully diluted book value per ordinary share is a financial measure important to investors and other interested parties. However, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry. (4) Return on average ordinary shareholders equity (ROE) is a non GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) for the year by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. See Return on Ordinary Shareholders Equity Calculation herein for a reconciliation of ROE to average ordinary shareholders equity. Underwriting profit property and casualty operations One way that the Company evaluates the performance of its insurance and reinsurance operations is by underwriting profit or loss. The Company does not measure performance based on the amount of gross premiums written. Underwriting profit or loss is calculated from premiums earned less net losses incurred and expenses related to underwriting activities. The Companys underwriting profit (loss) in the year ended December 31, 2011 was consistent with the combined ratio discussed below. Combined ratio property and casualty operations The combined ratio for P&C operations is used by the Company and many other insurance and reinsurance companies as another measure of underwriting profitability. The combined ratio is calculated from the net losses incurred and underwriting expenses as a ratio of the net premiums earned for the Companys insurance and reinsurance operations. A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit and greater than 100% reflects an underwriting loss. The Companys combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects an underwriting loss and is higher than the same period in the previous year, primarily as a result of an increase in the loss and loss expense ratio, partially offset by a marginal decrease in the underwriting expense ratio. The loss and loss expense ratio has increased as a result of higher levels of catastrophe losses, higher large loss activity in the energy, property and marine businesses of the Insurance segment and other large loss events in U.S. property including a deterioration in the performance of a large U.S. agricultural program in the Reinsurance segment. The Companys combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2010 is higher than for the same period in the previous year, primarily as a result of an increase in the loss and loss expense ratio, partially offset by a marginal decrease in the underwriting 55 expense ratio. The loss and loss expense ratio has increased as a result of higher levels of catastrophe losses and other large loss events in both the insurance and reinsurance segments. For further information on the combined ratio, see Income Statement Analysis below. Net investment income property and casualty (P&C) operations Net investment income related to P&C operations is an important measure that affects the Companys overall profitability. The largest liability of the Company relates to its unpaid loss reserves, and the Companys investment portfolio provides liquidity for claims settlements of these reserves as they become due. As a result, a significant part of the investment portfolio is invested in fixed income securities. Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates and credit spreads and changes in overall asset allocation. See the segment results at Investment Activities below for a discussion of the Companys net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2011. Book value per ordinary share Management also views the change in the Companys book value per ordinary share as an additional measure of the Companys performance. Book value per ordinary share is a non GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing ordinary shareholders equity (total shareholders equity less preference shareholders equity and non controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries) by the number of outstanding ordinary shares at any period end. Ordinary shares outstanding include all ordinary shares legally issued and outstanding (as disclosed on the face of the balance sheet) as well as all director share units outstanding. Book value per ordinary share is affected by the Companys net income (loss), any changes in the net unrealized gains and losses on its investment portfolio and currency translation adjustments and also the positive impact of any share buyback or issuance activity. Book value per ordinary share decreased by $0.52 in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to an increase of $5.73 during 2010. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to the net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $474.8 million and the impact of settlement of the forward purchase contracts associated with the 10.75% equity security units (the 10.75% Units), which resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of 30,456,600 ordinary shares, partially offset by an increase in net unrealized gains on available for sale investments and the benefit of share buyback activity. The increase in 2010 was a result of improved investment portfolio fair values, higher net income and the impact of share buyback activity. During 2010, there was a decrease in net unrealized losses on available for sale investments of $1.1 billion, net of tax, as compared to December 31, 2009. The improved investment portfolio fair values were due in large part to declining interest rates during 2010 but also tightening spreads. Fully diluted book value per ordinary share is a non GAAP financial measure and represents book value per ordinary share combined with the impact from dilution of share based compensation and certain conversion features where dilutive. Fully diluted book value per ordinary share decreased by $0.14 and increased by $5.18 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a result of the factors noted above. Return on average ordinary shareholders equity ROE is another non GAAP financial measure that management considers important in evaluating the Companys operating performance. ROE is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to ordinary shareholders for any period by the average of the opening and closing ordinary shareholders equity. The Company establishes minimum target ROEs for its total operations, segments and lines of business. If the Companys minimum ROE targets over the longer term are not met with respect to any line of business, the Company seeks to modify and or exit this line. In addition, among other factors, the Companys compensation of its senior officers is dependent on the achievement of the Companys performance goals to enhance ordinary shareholder value as measured by ROE (adjusted for certain items considered to be non operating in nature). In 2011, ROE was negative due to the net loss from the significant catastrophe losses and the impairment of goodwill, both discussed under Significant Items Affecting the Results of Operations. and other large loss events. See Return on Ordinary Shareholders Equity Calculation herein for a reconciliation of ROE to average ordinary shareholders equity. In 2010, ROE was 6.5%, 3.4 percentage points higher than for the same period in the prior year when it was 3.1%. This was the result of increased net income which was largely offset by significantly higher equity levels during 2010 following the increase in the fair value of the Companys investment portfolio. 56 SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys net income and other financial measures as shown above for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been affected by, among other things, the following significant items: 1) The impact of significant large natural catastrophe activity; 2) Continuing competitive factors impacting the underwriting environment; 3) Net favorable prior year loss development; 4) Market movement impacts on the Companys investment portfolio; and 5) Goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. 1. The impact of significant large natural catastrophe activity The following table outlines the underwriting losses and loss ratio impact for the Insurance and Reinsurance segments from natural catastrophes for the years ended December 31: Natural Catastrophe Underwriting Losses Natural Catastrophe Loss Ratio Impact (U.S. dollars in thousands, except ratios) 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Insurance $ 355,256 $ 135,771 $ 10,744 9.6 % 3.8 % 0.3 % Reinsurance 405,870 158,574 41,604 25.2 % 10.6 % 2.7 % Total P&C $ 761,126 $ 294,345 $ 52,348 14.4 % 5.8 % 1.0 % Notable natural catastrophes during the year ended December 31, 2011 included the Australia floods, the New Zealand earthquake, the Japan earthquake and tsunami, the U.S. Storms, the Atlantic Hurricanes and the Thailand floods. Notable natural catastrophes during 2010 included the Chilean Earthquake, European Windstorm Xynthia, U.S. tornadoes and hailstorm activity, the New Zealand Earthquake and floods in Central Europe, China, Poland and Queensland, Australia. In 2009, natural catastrophes included Hailstorm Wolfgang, Japanese earthquake, Windstorm Klaus, Typhoon Ketsana, Asian earthquake and tsunami and Australian wildfires. The Companys loss estimates are based on combinations of its review of individual treaties and policies expected to be impacted, commercial model outputs, client data received to the date the estimates are made, and consideration of expectations of total insured market loss estimates if available, both from published sources and the Companys internal analysis. The Companys loss estimates involve the exercise of considerable judgment due to the complexity and scale of the insured events, and are, accordingly, subject to revision as additional information becomes available. Actual losses may differ materially from these preliminary estimates. 57 The following are analyses of the financial impact on the Companys results of operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 from natural catastrophes: Three Months Ended December 31, 2011 Year Ended December 31, 2011 (U.S. dollars in thousands, except ratios) Insurance Reinsurance Total Insurance Reinsurance Total Operating data: Catastrophe reinstatement premium earned: Australia floods $ $ (475 ) $ (475 ) $ $ 475 $ 475 New Zealand earthquake 1,960 1,960 602 602 Japan earthquake and tsunami 518 518 17,148 17,148 U.S. Storms 91 91 1,160 1,160 Atlantic Hurricanes (1) 258 258 (7,242 ) 929 (6,313 ) Thailand floods (3,403 ) 6,044 2,641 (3,403 ) 6,044 2,641 Other natural catastrophes (2) (3) 504 504 2,880 2,880 Total net premiums earned $ (3,145 ) $ 8,642 $ 5,497 $ (10,645 ) $ 29,238 $ 18,593 Gross losses and loss expenses: Australia floods $ (630 ) $ 3 $ (627 ) $ (80,855 ) $ (15,623 ) $ (96,478 ) New Zealand earthquake (2,204 ) (2,204 ) (5,000 ) (99,198 ) (104,198 ) Japan earthquake and tsunami (4,585 ) 7,549 2,964 (93,185 ) (179,085 ) (272,270 ) U.S. Storms (56 ) (16,625 ) (16,681 ) (5,660 ) (79,278 ) (84,938 ) Atlantic Hurricanes (1) (60,902 ) 3,869 (57,033 ) (192,893 ) (15,335 ) (208,228 ) Thailand floods (123,237 ) (61,643 ) (184,880 ) (123,237 ) (61,643 ) (184,880 ) Other natural catastrophes (2) (3) (7,833 ) (141 ) (7,974 ) (21,243 ) (23,823 ) (45,066 ) Total gross losses and loss expenses $ (197,243 ) $ (69,192 ) $ (266,435 ) $ (522,073 ) $ (473,985 ) $ (996,058 ) Losses and loss expenses recoverable: Australia floods $ $ $ $ 27,525 $ $ 27,525 New Zealand earthquake (2,082 ) (2,082 ) 32,017 32,017 Japan earthquake and tsunami 472 (200 ) 272 14,072 14,072 U.S. Storms 1,128 1,128 315 5,952 6,267 Atlantic Hurricanes (1) 39,709 (79 ) 39,630 105,359 508 105,867 Thailand floods 24,483 24,483 24,483 24,483 Other natural catastrophes (2) (3) 2,642 2,642 5,708 400 6,108 Total losses and loss expenses recoverable $ 67,306 $ (1,233 ) $ 66,073 $ 177,462 $ 38,877 $ 216,339 Underwriting loss P&C Operations: Australia floods $ (630 ) $ (472 ) $ (1,102 ) $ (53,330 ) $ (15,148 ) $ (68,478 ) New Zealand earthquake (2,326 ) (2,326 ) (5,000 ) (66,579 ) (71,579 ) Japan earthquake and tsunami (4,113 ) 7,867 3,754 (79,113 ) (161,937 ) (241,050 ) U.S. Storms (56 ) (15,406 ) (15,462 ) (5,345 ) (72,166 ) (77,511 ) Atlantic Hurricanes (1) (20,935 ) 3,790 (17,145 ) (94,776 ) (13,898 ) (108,674 ) Thailand floods (102,157 ) (55,599 ) (157,756 ) (102,157 ) (55,599 ) (157,756 ) Other natural catastrophes (2) (3) (5,191 ) 363 (4,828 ) (15,535 ) (20,543 ) (36,078 ) Total underwriting loss $ (133,082 ) $ (61,783 ) $ (194,865 ) $ (355,256 ) $ (405,870 ) $ (761,126 ) Loss ratio impact for the three months and year ended December 31, 2011 13.9 % 15.0 % 14.2 % 9.6 % 25.2 % 14.4 % (1) Atlantic Hurricanes refers to Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.

(3) For the Reinsurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2011, Other natural catastrophes include Cyclone Yasi in Australia, the Slave Lake fire in Canada, Texas wildfires and the Danish floods. For further details see the segment results in the Income Statement Analysis below. 2. Continuing competitive factors impacting the underwriting environment Soft market conditions were experienced across most lines of business throughout 2009, 2010 and 2011. This resulted in an overall decrease in gross and net premiums written in 2010 and 2009 but these amounts increased in 2011 due to new strategic initiatives. For further information in relation to the underwriting environment, including details relating to rates and retention, see Executive Overview Underwriting Environment, above. 58 3. Net favorable prior year loss development Net favorable prior year loss development occurs when there is a decrease to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prior years that is less than expected loss development. Net prior year adverse loss development occurs when there is an increase to loss reserves recorded at the beginning of the year, resulting from actual or reported loss development for prior years exceeding expected loss development. The following table presents the net (favorable) adverse prior year loss development of the Companys loss and loss expense reserves for its property and casualty operations which include the Insurance and Reinsurance segments for each of the years indicated: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Insurance segment $ (76.5 ) $ (127.4 ) $ (62.9 ) Reinsurance segment (208.4 ) (245.5 ) (221.8 ) Total $ (284.9 ) $ (372.9 ) $ (284.7 ) The Company is a major writer of large, complex energy related (re)insurance coverages and manages its exposure through, among other items, the purchase of reinsurance. Recent developments have reduced some of the uncertainty surrounding the Companys third party liability exposure to losses arising from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, including settlements by companies subject to lawsuits and judicial rulings in respect of the applicability and extent of contractual indemnities. In 2011, the Company strengthened its overall net incurred position relating to Deepwater Horizon across insurance and reinsurance segments by $72.7 million for a total net incurred to date of $165.7 million as at year end including both property damage and liability exposures. Very recent judicial decisions upholding indemnities owing from BP p.l.c. to other companies subject to lawsuits may be favorable to the Companys overall position. Despite the level of strengthening incurred resulting from this unusual event, the Companys total net reserves developed favorably by $285 million during 2011 as shown in the above table. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Losses and Loss Expenses, for further information regarding the developments in prior year loss reserve estimates for each of the years indicated within each of the Companys operating segments. 4. Market movement impacts on the Companys investment portfolio During the year ended December 31, 2011, credit spreads widened, particularly in Euro zone, offset by decreasing interest rates. The net impact of the market conditions on the Companys investment portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2011 was favorable and resulted in an increase in the net unrealized position of on available for sale investments as compared to December 31, 2010 of $558.1 million. This represents approximately a 2.0% appreciation on average available for sale assets for the year ended December 31, 2011. The following table provides further detail regarding the movements in the global credit markets, as well as in government interest rates using some sample market indices: Interest Rate Movement for the year ended December 31, 2011 (1) (+/ represents increases / decreases in interest rates) Credit Spread Movement for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2) (+/ represents widening / tightening of credit spreads) United States 118 basis points (5 year Treasury) +94 basis points (US Corporate A rated) +6 basis points (US Mortgage Master Index) +23 basis points (US CMBS, AAA rated) United Kingdom 142 basis points (10 year Gilt) +72 basis points (UK Corporate, AA rated) Euro zone 108 basis points (5 year Bund) +122 basis points (Europe Corporate, A rated) (1) Source: Bloomberg Finance L.P.

Net realized losses on investments in the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $188.4 million, including net realized losses of approximately $160.2 million related to the impairment of certain of the Companys fixed income investments, where the Company determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments related to credit. For further analysis of this, see Results of Operations below. 59 5. Goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 The Company performs periodic impairment testing related to goodwill as circumstances require, in addition to its annual testing as of June 30 each year. The interim impairment test completed during the fourth quarter of 2011 resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $429.0 million. The charge relates to the Insurance segment. The impairment was determined using the methodologies as described within Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below, which includes discounted cash flow analyses and comparison with similar companies using their publicly traded price multiples as the basis for valuation. Continued low valuations in the insurance industry as a whole combined with several years of poor underwriting performance in the segment have impacted the technical valuations; however, management continues to see significant value in the Companys global insurance platform. For further information, see Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and see further discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. OTHER KEY FOCUSES OF MANAGEMENT Throughout 2011 and into 2012, the Company remained focused on, among other things, managing its capital, tailoring the Companys business model to focus on core P&C business, optimizing the P&C investment portfolio, and enhancing its enterprise risk management capabilities. The Company continues to focus on those lines of business within its Insurance and Reinsurance segments that provide the best return on capital. Details of these and other initiatives are outlined below. Capital Management Fundamental to supporting the Companys business model is its ability to underwrite business, which is largely dependent upon the quality of its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies. As a result, in the event that the Company is downgraded, its ability to write business, as well as its financial condition and or results of operations, could be adversely affected. Buybacks of Ordinary Shares On September 24, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a share buyback program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $500.0 million of its ordinary shares. As of January 1, 2010, $375.4 million ordinary shares remained available for purchase under that program. During 2010, the Company purchased and canceled 18.8 million ordinary shares under the program for $375.4 million, the full amount that had remained under that buyback program. On November 2, 2010, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share buyback program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares. During 2010, the Company purchased and canceled 6.9 million ordinary shares under this program for $144.0 million. During 2011, the Company purchased and canceled 31.7 million ordinary shares under this program for $665.5 million. All share buybacks were carried out by way of redemption in accordance with Irish law and the Companys constitutional documents. All shares so redeemed were canceled upon redemption. At December 31, 2011, $190.5 million remained available to be used for purchases under this program. No further buybacks have been made as of February 24, 2012. Sale of 5.75% Senior Notes On September 30, 2011, XL Cayman completed the public sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes (the 5.75% Senior Notes) due 2021 at the issue price of 100% of the principal amount. The 5.75% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by XL Ireland. The 5.75% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per annum, payable semiannually, beginning on April 1, 2012, and mature on October 1, 2021. XL Cayman may redeem the 5.75% Senior Notes, in whole or part, from time to time in accordance with the terms of the indenture pursuant to which the 5.75% Senior Notes were issued. XL Cayman received net proceeds of approximately $395.9 million from the offering, which were used to partially repay the $600 million principal amount outstanding of the 6.5% Guaranteed Senior Notes due January 2012 (the XLCFE Notes), which were issued by XL Capital Finance (Europe) plc (XLCFE). Repayment of the XLCFE Notes On January 15, 2012, the $600 million principal amount outstanding of the XLCFE Notes was repaid at maturity. Equity Security Units In August 2011, in accordance with the terms of the 10.75% Units, XL Cayman purchased and retired all of the 8.25% senior notes due August 2021 (the 8.25% Senior Notes) for $575 million in a remarketing. These notes comprised a part of the 10.75% Units. The proceeds from the remarketing were used to satisfy the purchase price for XL Irelands ordinary shares issued to holders of the 10.75% Units pursuant to the forward purchase contracts comprising a part of the 10.75% Units. Each forward purchase contract provided for the issuance of 1.3242 ordinary shares of XL Ireland at a price of $25 per share. The settlement of the forward purchase 60 contracts resulted in XL Irelands issuance of an aggregate of 30,456,600 ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $575 million. As a result of the settlement of the forward purchase contracts, the 10.75% Units ceased to exist and are no longer traded on the NYSE. Series C Preference Ordinary Shares On March 26, 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer for a portion its outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares that resulted in approximately 12.7 million Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation value of $317.3 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $104.7 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, combined with professional fees totaling $0.8 million. As a result, a book value gain to ordinary shareholders of approximately $211.8 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009. On February 12, 2010, the Company repurchased a portion of its outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares, which resulted in approximately 4.4 million Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation value of $110.8 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $94.2 million. As a result, a book value gain of approximately $16.6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2010 to ordinary shareholders. On February 16, 2011, the Company repurchased 30,000 of the outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation preference value of $0.75 million for $0.65 million. On August 15, 2011, XL Cayman completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares that resulted in 2,811,000 Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation value of $25 per share being repurchased and canceled by XL Cayman for approximately $71.0 million including accrued and unpaid dividends and professional fees. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, and on the same terms as the offer, XL Cayman repurchased and canceled the remaining outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares for approximately $0.9 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends. As of December 31, 2011, no Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares were outstanding. Series D Preference Ordinary Shares On October 15, 2011, XL Cayman issued 350,000 non cumulative Series D Preference Ordinary Shares for $350 million of cash and liquid investments that were held in a trust account that was part of the Stoneheath Re (Stoneheath) facility. Holders of the non cumulative perpetual preferred securities (Stoneheath Securities) issued by Stoneheath in December 2006 received one Series D Preference Ordinary Share in exchange for each Stoneheath Security. Dividends on the non cumulative Series D Preference Ordinary Shares are declared and paid quarterly at a floating rate of three month LIBOR plus 3.120% on the liquidation preference. The Series D Preference Ordinary Shares are perpetual securities with no fixed maturity dates and are not convertible into any of the Companys other securities. On December 5, 2011, the Company repurchased 5,000 of the outstanding Series D Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation preference value of $5.0 million for $3.7 million, including accrued dividends. As a result of these repurchases, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $1.3 million through Non controlling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of 2011. Series E Preference Ordinary Shares On March 15, 2007, the Company issued 1.0 million Fixed/Floating Series E Perpetual Non Cumulative preference ordinary shares, par value $0.01 each, with liquidation preference $1,000 per share (the Series E preference ordinary shares). The Company received net proceeds of approximately $983.8 million from the offering. The Series E preference ordinary shares are perpetual securities with no fixed maturity date and are not convertible into any of the Companys other securities. On February 16, 2011, the Company repurchased 500 of the outstanding Series E preference ordinary shares with a liquidation preference value of $0.50 million for $0.47 million. As a result of these repurchases, the Company recorded a reduction in Non controlling interests of approximately $0.13 million in the first quarter of 2011. 61 Risk Management The Companys risk management and risk appetite framework is detailed at Item 1, Business Enterprise Risk Management. The table below shows the Companys estimated per event net 1% and 0.4% exceedance probability exposures for certain peak natural catastrophe peril regions. These estimates assume that amounts due from reinsurance and retrocession purchases are 100% collectible. There may be credit or other disputes associated with these potential receivables. Finally, the probable maximum losses in the table below were derived by application of a new vendor model that was released during the first quarter of 2011 and, accordingly, could be more unreliable than the model that was used historically. 1 in 100 Event 1 in 250 Event Geographical Zone (U.S. dollars in millions) Peril Measurement Date of In Force Exposures (1) Probable Maximum Loss (2) Percentage of Tangible Shareholders Equity at December 31, 2011 Probable Maximum Loss (2) Percentage of Tangible Shareholders Equity at December 31, 2011 North America Earthquake October 1, 2011 $ 785 7.6 % $ 1,263 12.2 % North Atlantic Windstorm October 1, 2011 1,338 12.9 % 1,710 16.5 % U.S. Windstorm October 1, 2011 1,319 12.7 % 1,695 16.4 % Europe Windstorm October 1, 2011 474 4.6 % 636 6.1 % Japan Earthquake October 1, 2011 240 2.3 % 323 3.1 % Japan Windstorm October 1, 2011 131 1.3 % 193 1.9 % (1) Detailed analyses of aggregated in force exposures and maximum loss levels are done periodically. The measurement dates represent the date of the last completed detailed analysis by geographical zone. (2) Probable maximum losses include secondary uncertainty which incorporates variability around the expected probable maximum loss for each event, does not represent the Companys maximum potential exposures and are pre tax. See Significant Items Affecting the Results of Operations 1) The impact of significant large natural catastrophe activity above. Regulatory Change Management continues to actively monitor the various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact the Company globally and assess the potential for significant impact on results or operations. The European Commission is in the process of implementing changes to the prudential regulation of European insurers, known as Solvency II, with a timeline to achieve full compliance by January 1, 2014. Solvency II is designed to impose economic risk based solvency requirements across all EU Member States. Advice and implementation consists of three pillars: (1) Pillar I quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet; (2) Pillar II qualitative regulatory review, which includes governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and supervisory review process, and (3) Pillar III market discipline, which is accomplished through reporting of the insurers financial condition to regulators and the public. Other jurisdictions such as Bermuda and Canada are in the process of implementing consistent changes to strengthen their capital and risk management requirements in order to be considered equivalent for purposes of group regulatory considerations. The Company has significant resources supporting the regulatory process, such as the Solvency II Quantitative Impact Studies and Bermuda Monetary Authority regulatory data calls, and these resources are also actively engaged in the implementation of Solvency II related measures across the Company. 62 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following are considered to be the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates due to the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and or the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions or estimates applied for any or all of the accounting policies (either individually or in the aggregate), there could be a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These critical accounting policies have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. Other significant accounting policies are nevertheless important to an understanding of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Policies such as those related to revenue recognition, financial instruments and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies. 1) Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses and Unpaid Loss and Loss Expenses Recoverable As the Company earns premiums for the underwriting risks it assumes, it also establishes an estimate of the expected ultimate losses related to the premium. Loss reserves for unpaid loss and loss expenses are established due to the significant periods of time that may elapse between the occurrence, reporting and settlement of a loss. The process of establishing reserves for unpaid property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability, as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. Loss reserves include: a) Case reserves reserves for reported losses and loss expenses that have not yet been settled; and b) IBNR reserves reserves for incurred but not reported losses or for reported losses over and above the amount of case reserves. Case Reserves Case reserves for the Companys property and casualty operations are established by management based on amounts reported from insureds or ceding companies and consultation with legal counsel, and represent the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have been reported to or specifically identified by the Company. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among the Companys operations. With respect to the Companys insurance operations, the Company is notified of insured losses and records a case reserve for the estimated amount of the settlement, if any. The estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and, where appropriate, advice of legal counsel. Reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process. With respect to the Companys reinsurance operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the estimated ultimate cost of a loss. The uncertainty in the reserving process for reinsurers is due, in part, to the time lags inherent in reporting from the original claimant to the primary insurer to the reinsurer. As a predominantly broker market reinsurer for both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the Company is subject to a potential additional time lag in the receipt of information as the primary insurer reports to the broker who in turn reports to the Company. As of December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any significant backlog related to its processing of assumed reinsurance information. Since the Company relies on information regarding paid losses, case reserves and IBNR provided by ceding companies in order to assist it in estimating its liability for unpaid losses and LAE, the Company maintains certain procedures in order to help determine the completeness and accuracy of such information. Periodically, management assesses the reporting activities of its ceding companies on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria. In addition to conferring with ceding companies or brokers on claims matters, the Companys claims personnel conduct periodic audits of specific claims and the overall claims procedures of its ceding companies at their offices. The Company relies on its ability to effectively monitor the claims handling and claims reserving practices of ceding companies in order to help establish the proper reinsurance premium for reinsurance agreements and to establish proper loss reserves. Disputes with ceding companies have been rare and generally have been resolved through negotiation. In addition to information received from ceding companies on reported claims, the Company also utilizes information on the pattern of ceding company loss reporting and loss settlements from previous catastrophic events in order to estimate the Companys ultimate liability related to catastrophic events such as hurricanes. Commercial catastrophe model analyses and zonal aggregate exposures are utilized to assess potential client loss before and after an event. Initial cedant loss reports are generally obtained shortly after a catastrophic event, with subsequent updates received as new information becomes available. The Company actively requests 63 loss updates from cedants periodically whilst there is still considerable uncertainty for an event, often for the first year following an event. The Companys claim settlement processes also incorporate an update to the total loss reserve at the time a claim payment is made to a ceding company. While the reliance on loss reports from ceding companies may increase the level of uncertainty associated with the estimation of total loss reserves for property catastrophe reinsurance relative to direct property insurance, there are several factors which serve to reduce the uncertainty in loss reserve estimates for property catastrophe reinsurance. First, for large natural catastrophe events, aggregate limits in property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are generally fully exhausted by the loss reserve estimates. Second, as a reinsurer, the Company has access to information from a broad cross section of the insurance industry. The Company utilizes such information in order to perform consistency checks on the data provided by ceding companies and is able to identify trends in loss reporting and settlement activity and incorporate such information in its estimate of IBNR reserves. Finally, the Company also supplements the loss information received from cedants with loss estimates developed by market share techniques and or from third party catastrophe models applied to exposure data supplied by cedants. IBNR Reserves IBNR reserves represent managements best estimate, at a given point in time, of the amount in excess of case reserves that is needed for the future settlement and loss adjustment costs associated with claims incurred. It is possible that the ultimate liability may differ materially from these estimates. Because the ultimate amount of unpaid losses and LAE is uncertain, the Company believes that quantitative techniques to estimate these amounts are enhanced by professional and managerial judgment. Management reviews the IBNR estimates produced by the Companys actuaries who determine the best estimate of the liabilities to record in the Companys financial statements. The Company considers this single point estimate to be the mean expected outcome. IBNR reserves are estimated by the Companys actuaries using several standard actuarial methodologies including the loss ratio method, the loss development or chain ladder method, the Bornhuetter Ferguson (BF) method and frequency and severity approaches. IBNR related to a specific event may be based on the Companys estimated exposure to an industry loss and may include the use of catastrophe modeling software. On a quarterly basis, IBNR reserves are reviewed by the Companys actuaries, and are adjusted as new information becomes available. Any such adjustments are accounted for as changes in estimates and are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which they are made. The Companys actuaries use one set of assumptions in calculating the single point estimate, which includes actual loss data, loss development factors, loss ratios, reported claim frequency and severity. The actuarial reviews and documentation are completed in accordance with professional actuarial standards with reserves established on a basis consistent with GAAP. The selected assumptions reflect the actuarys judgment based on historical data and experience combined with information concerning current underwriting, economic, judicial, regulatory and other influences on ultimate claim settlements. When estimating IBNR reserves, each of the Companys insurance and reinsurance business units segregate business into exposure classes. Within each class, the business is further segregated by either the year in which the contract incepted (underwriting year), the year in which the claim occurred (accident year), or the year in which the claim is reported (report year). The majority of the Insurance segment is reviewed on an accident year basis. Professional lines insurance business is reviewed on a report year basis due to the claims made nature of the underlying policies. The majority of the Reinsurance segment is reviewed on an underwriting year basis. Generally, initial actuarial estimates of IBNR reserves not related to a specific event are based on the loss ratio method applied to each class of business. Actual paid losses and case reserves (reported losses) are subtracted from expected ultimate losses to determine IBNR reserves. The initial expected ultimate losses involve management judgment and are based on historical information for that class of business; which includes loss ratios, market conditions, changes in pricing and conditions, underwriting changes, changes in claims emergence, and other factors that may influence expected ultimate losses. Over time, as a greater number of claims are reported, actuarial estimates of IBNR are based on the BF method and loss development techniques. The BF method utilizes actual loss data and the expected patterns of loss emergence, combined with an initial expectation of ultimate losses to determine an estimate of ultimate losses. This method may be appropriate when there is limited actual loss data and a relatively less stable pattern of loss emergence. The chain ladder method utilizes actual loss and expected patterns of loss emergence to determine an estimate of ultimate losses that is independent of the initial expectation of ultimate losses. This method may be appropriate when there is a relatively stable pattern of loss emergence and a relatively larger number of reported claims. Multiple estimates of ultimate losses using a variety of actuarial methods are calculated for each of the Companys classes of business for each year of loss experience. The Companys actuaries look at each class and determine the most appropriate point estimate based on the characteristics of the particular class and other relevant factors, such as historical ultimate loss ratios, the presence of individual large losses, and known occurrences that have not yet resulted in reported losses. Once the Companys actuaries make their determination of the most appropriate point estimate for each class, this information is aggregated and presented to management for review and approval. 64 The pattern of loss emergence is determined using actuarial analysis, including judgment, and is based on the historical patterns of the recording of paid and reported losses by the Company, as well as industry information. Information that may cause historical patterns to differ from future patterns is considered and reflected in expected patterns as appropriate. For property, marine and aviation insurance, losses are generally reported within 2 to 3 years from the beginning of the accident year. For casualty insurance, loss emergence patterns can vary from 3 years to over 20 years depending on the type of business. For other insurance, loss emergence patterns fall between the property and casualty insurance. For reinsurance business, loss reporting lags the corresponding insurance classes often by at least one quarter due to the need for loss information to flow from the ceding companies to the Company generally via reinsurance intermediaries. Such lags in loss reporting are reflected in the actuarys selections of loss reporting patterns used in establishing the Companys reserves. Such estimates are not precise because, among other things, they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claim severity, claim frequency, and other issues. In the process of estimating IBNR reserves, provisions for economic inflation and changes in the social and legal environment are considered, but involve considerable judgment. When estimating IBNR reserves, more judgment is typically required for lines of business with longer loss emergence patterns. Due to the low frequency and high severity nature of some of the business underwritten by the Company, the Companys reserve estimates are highly dependent on actuarial and management judgment and are therefore uncertain. In property classes, there can be additional uncertainty in loss estimation related to large catastrophe events. With wind events, such as hurricanes, the damage assessment process may take more than a year. The cost of claims is subject to volatility due to supply shortages for construction materials and labor. In the case of earthquakes, the damage assessment process may take several years as buildings are discovered to have structural weaknesses not initially detected. The uncertainty inherent in IBNR reserve estimates is particularly pronounced for casualty coverages, such as excess liability, professional liability coverages, and workers compensation, where information emerges relatively slowly over time. The Companys three types of property and casualty reserve exposure with the longest tails are: (1) high layer excess casualty insurance; (2) casualty reinsurance; and (3) discontinued asbestos and long tail environmental business. Certain aspects of the Companys casualty operations complicate the actuarial process for establishing reserves. Certain casualty business written by the Companys insurance operations is high layer excess casualty business, meaning that the Companys liability attaches after large deductibles including self insurance or insurance from sources other than the Company. The Company commenced writing this type of business in 1986 and issued policies in forms that were different from traditional policies used by the industry at that time. Initially, there was a lack of industry data available for this type of business. Consequently, the basis for establishing loss reserves by the Company for this type of business was largely judgmental and based upon the Companys own reported loss experience which was used as a basis for determining ultimate losses, and therefore IBNR reserves. Over time, the amount of available historical loss experience data has increased. As a result, the Company has obtained a larger statistical base to assist in establishing reserves for these excess casualty insurance claims. High layer excess casualty insurance claims typically involve claims relating to (i) a shock loss such as an explosion or transportation accident causing severe damage to persons and or property over a short period of time, (ii) a non shock loss where a large number of claimants are exposed to injurious conditions over a longer period of time, such as exposure to chemicals or pharmaceuticals or (iii) a professional liability loss such as a medical malpractice claim. In each case, these claims are ultimately settled following extensive negotiations and legal proceedings. This process typically takes 5 to 15 years following the date of loss. Reinsurance operations by their nature add further complications to the reserving process, particularly for casualty business written, in that there is an inherent lag in the timing and reporting of a loss event from an insured or ceding company to the reinsurer. This reporting lag creates an even longer period of time between the policy inception and when a claim is finally settled. As a result, more judgment is required to establish reserves for ultimate claims in the Companys reinsurance operations. In the Companys reinsurance operations, case reserves for reported claims are generally established based on reports received from ceding companies. Additional case reserves may be established by the Company to reflect the Companys estimated ultimate cost of a loss. Casualty reinsurance business involves reserving methods that generally include historical aggregated claim information as reported by ceding companies, combined with the results of claims and underwriting reviews of a sample of the ceding companys claims and underwriting files. Therefore, the Company does not always receive detailed claim information for this line of business. Discontinued asbestos and long tail environmental business were contained within certain policies previously written by NAC Re Corp. (now known as XL Reinsurance America Inc.), prior to its acquisition by the Company. At December 31, 2011, total gross unpaid losses and loss expenses in respect of this business represented less than 1% of unpaid losses and loss expenses. 65 Except for certain workers compensation (including long term disability) and certain U.K. motor liabilities, the Company does not discount its unpaid losses and loss expenses. The Company utilizes tabular reserving for workers compensation unpaid losses that are considered fixed and determinable. For further discussion see the Consolidated Financial Statements. Loss and loss expenses are charged to income as they are incurred. These charges include loss and loss expense payments and any changes in case and IBNR reserves. During the loss settlement period, additional facts regarding claims are reported. As these additional facts are reported, it may be necessary to increase or decrease the unpaid losses and loss expense reserves. The actual final liability may be significantly different than prior estimates. The amount of the Companys net unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to the Companys operating segments at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Insurance $ 11,374 $ 11,240 Reinsurance 5,610 5,642 Net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves $ 16,984 $ 16,882 Net Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses as at December 31, 2011 Net Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses as at December 31, 2010 (U.S. dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves Insurance Casualty professional lines $ 1,244 $ 3,175 $ 4,419 $ 1,280 $ 3,093 $ 4,373 Casualty other lines 1,180 2,628 3,808 1,392 2,454 3,846 Property 475 308 783 414 96 510 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 534 439 973 514 447 961 Other specialty lines (1) 413 675 1,088 375 630 1,005 Other (2) 196 66 262 341 144 485 Structured indemnity 41 41 60 60 Total $ 4,042 $ 7,332 $ 11,374 $ 4,316 $ 6,924 $ 11,240 Reinsurance Casualty (3) $ 1,501 $ 1,999 $ 3,500 $ 1,606 $ 2,122 $ 3,728 Property catastrophe (4) 180 197 377 146 192 338 Other property 410 467 877 322 397 719 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 399 71 470 367 30 397 Other (2) 163 174 337 201 202 403 Structured indemnity 49 49 57 57 Total 2,653 2,957 5,610 $ 2,642 3,000 5,642 TOTAL $ 6,695 $ 10,289 $ 16,984 $ 6,958 $ 9,924 $ 16,882 (1) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, specie, middle markets and excess and surplus lines. (2) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. (3) Within the Reinsurance segment, casualty other and casualty professional lines of business are shown in the aggregate. (4) Property catastrophe IBNR includes event specific reserves for losses that the Companys insureds and cedants have informed the Company they expect to incur but have not yet had reported known claims. As noted above, management reviews the IBNR estimates produced by the Companys actuaries who determine the best estimate of the liabilities to record in the Companys financial statements. The Company considers this single point estimate to be the mean expected outcome. Management believes that the actuarial methods utilized adequately provide for loss development. Management does not build in a provision for uncertainty outside of the estimates prepared by the Companys actuaries. While the proportion of unpaid losses and loss expenses represented by IBNR is sensitive to a number of factors, the most significant ones have historically been accelerated business growth and changes in business mix. Other factors that have affected the ratio in the past include additions to prior period reserves, catastrophic occurrences, settlement of large claims and changes in claims settlement patterns. 66 The ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased in recent years, with the increase attributable to professional lines of business where we continue to hold IBNR for subprime and related credit crisis claims and other potential clash exposures in recent years while these claims develop at a relatively slow pace. Additionally, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves has increased this year for the property lines due to late 2011 catastrophe activity. Typically, the ratio of IBNR to total reserves is greater for casualty (including professional) lines (which are longer tail in nature) than for property lines due to the policy forms utilized and timing of loss reporting and settlement. IBNR reserves are calculated by the Companys actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies as discussed above. Since the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company adopted a methodology that provides a single point reserve estimate separately for each line of business and also a range of possible outcomes across each single point reserve estimate. This is discussed further below. The following table shows the recorded estimate and the high and low ends of the range of the Companys net unpaid losses and loss expenses for each of the lines of business noted above at December 31, 2011: Net Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recorded as at December 31, 2011 Range of Net Unpaid Losses & Loss Expenses Estimated as at December 31, 2011 Range of Net Unpaid Losses & Loss Expenses Estimated as at December 31, 2011 (U.S. dollars in millions) High Low Insurance Casualty professional lines $ 4,419 $ 4,977 $ 3,893 Casualty other lines 3,808 4,288 3,353 Property 783 856 711 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 973 1,079 872 Other specialty lines (1) 1,088 1,205 977 Other (2) 262 296 231 Total (3) $ 11,333 $ 12,372 $ 10,337 Reinsurance Casualty (4) $ 3,500 $ 3,866 $ 3,152 Property catastrophe 377 467 295 Other property 877 1,027 738 Marine, energy, aviation, and satellite 470 549 394 Other (2) 337 389 288 Total (3) $ 5,561 $ 6,068 $ 5,073 Structured Indemnity (3) $ 90 Total $ 16,984 (1) Other specialty lines within the Insurance segment includes: environmental, programs, equine, warranty, and excess and surplus lines. (2) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. (3) The range for the total Insurance and Reinsurance segment reserves is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business shown in the table due to diversification benefits across the lines of business. In addition, the total for each of the Insurance and Reinsurance segments does not include reserves relating to structured indemnity business as the Company does not develop reserve ranges for this line of business. (4) Within the Reinsurance segment, casualty other and casualty professional lines of business are shown in the aggregate. There are factors that would cause reserves to increase or decrease within the context of the range provided. The magnitude of any change in ultimate losses would be determined by the magnitude of any changes to the Companys assumptions or combined impact of changes in assumptions. Factors that would increase reserves include, but are not limited to, increases in claim severity, increases in expected level of reported claims, changes to the regulatory environment which expand the exposure insured by the Company, changes in the litigation environment that increase claim awards, filings or verdicts, unexpected increases in loss inflation, and or new types of claims being pursued against the Company. Factors that would decrease reserves include, but are not limited to, decreases in claim severity, reductions in the expected level of reported claims, changes to the regulatory environment which contract the exposure insured by the Company, changes in the litigation environment that decrease claim awards, filings or verdicts, and or unexpected decreases in loss inflation. The Companys methodology in 2011 for calculating reserve ranges around its single point reserve estimate is consistent with that used in 2010. The Company modeled a statistical distribution of potential reserve outcomes over a one year run off period for each of the approximately 35 lines of business. In doing so the Company evaluated a number of alternative models, and for each line of business the Companys actuaries selected the distribution parameters deemed to be most appropriate. Factors affecting this decision included an assessment of the model fit, availability and relevance of data and the impact of changes in business mix. The Company used the modeled statistical distribution to calculate an 80% confidence interval for the potential reserve outcomes over this 67 one year run off period. The high and low end points of the ranges set forth in the above table are such that there is a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop higher than the high point and a 10% modeled probability that the reserve will develop lower than the low point. The development of a reserve range models the uncertainty of the claim environment as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data. These uncertainties and limitations are not specific to the Company. The ranges represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes over a one year development period. A range of possible outcomes should not be confused with a range of best estimates. The range of best estimates will generally be much narrower than the range of possible outcomes as it will reflect reasonable actuarial best estimates of the expected reserve. Reserve volatility was analyzed for each line of business (excluding structured indemnity) within both the Reinsurance and Insurance segments using the Companys historical data, supplemented by industry data. These ranges were then aggregated to the lines of business shown above taking into account correlation between lines of business. The practical result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges by line of business disclosed above are narrower than the sum of the ranges of the individual lines of business. Similarly, the range for the Companys total reserves in the aggregate, is narrower than the sum of the ranges for the lines of business disclosed above. On an annual basis, the Company reviews the correlation assumptions between its various lines of business. Since 2006, the Company has utilized a simplified approach of assigning ratings of low, medium or high to its correlation assumptions for each line of business pairing based on the judgment of the reserving actuaries. This simplified approach has been utilized due to the limited amount of historical experience within the Companys portfolio as well as limited applicable industry data. However, the Companys actual historical experience and industry data were used to judgmentally select a range of values for the low, medium and high correlations, respectively, of 15%, 30% and 50%. It should be noted that both the Companys own experience and the industry data exhibit negative correlations in reserve developments between certain lines of business. However, as a measure of prudence in evaluating the reserve ranges, the Company has used a minimum of 15% correlation between any two lines of business. The analysis of correlations and the reflection of potential diversification benefits across lines of business represent another area of uncertainty in the development of estimated reserve ranges. The Company is not aware of any generally accepted model to perform the reserve range analysis described above. However, other models may be employed to develop these ranges. See Segments, below for further discussion on prior year development of loss reserves. Unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable The recognition of unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves the Companys estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of the Companys loss reserving process and, consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Unpaid losses and loss expenses and unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable). The second judgment involves the Companys estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that the Company will ultimately be unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. See Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Reinsurance, for further information. The Company uses a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, estimated recovery rates and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurers balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by the Company with the same legal entity for which the Company believes there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. 2) Future Policy Benefit Reserves Future policy benefit reserves relate to the Companys Life operations and are estimated using assumptions for investment yields, mortality, expenses and provisions for adverse loss deviation. Uncertainties related to interest rate volatility and mortality experience make it difficult to project and value the ultimate benefit payments. Most of the Companys future policy benefit reserves relate to annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts under which the Company makes annuity payments throughout the term of the contract for a specified portfolio of policies. For certain of these contracts, a single premium is paid at inception of the contract by way of a transfer of cash and investments to the Company. 68 The reserving methodology for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts is described in the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB for accounting and reporting by insurance for certain long duration contracts as well as authoritative guidance over realized gains and losses from the sale of investments. These contracts subject the Company to risks arising from policyholder mortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected. Liabilities for future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance with the provisions of this guidance. Claims and expenses for individual policies within these annuity reinsurance contracts are projected over the lifetime of the contract to calculate a net present value of future cash flows. Assumptions for each element of the basis (mortality, expenses and interest) are determined at the issue of the contract and these assumptions are locked in throughout the term of the contract unless a premium deficiency exists. The assumptions are best estimate assumptions plus provisions for adverse deviations on the key risk elements (i.e., mortality and interest). Provisions for adverse deviation are designed to cover reasonable deviations from the best estimate outcome of the contract. As the experience on the contracts emerges, the assumptions are reviewed. This occurs at least annually and includes both an analysis of experience and review of likely future experience. If such review would produce reserves in excess of those currently held then lock in assumptions will be revised and a loss recognized. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there were no adjustments to the locked in assumptions for these annuity reinsurance contracts. The future policy benefit reserves for these annuity portfolio reinsurance contracts amounted to $4.0 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively. The Company holds the investment assets backing these liabilities. These investments are primarily fixed income securities with maturities that closely match the expected claims settlement profile. A 0.1% decrease in the investment yield assumption would result in approximately a $31 million increase in the value of future claims related to annuity portfolio reinsurance. As stated above, the future policy benefit reserves include provisions for adverse deviation in excess of best estimate assumptions consistent with the underlying pricing that amounted to approximately $36 million and $193 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The reduction in 2011 has arisen as the Company has taken a more conservative view of future mortality improvements in its best estimate assumptions. The future policy benefit reserves would only be increased if these provisions for adverse deviation became insufficient in the light of emerging claims experience. The present value of future claims would increase by approximately $19 million if mortality rates were to decrease by 1% in all future years, relative to the reserving assumptions. The Company also provides reinsurance of disability income protection, for an in force block of business. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $99 million and $96 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves include the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide an income if the policyholder becomes sick or disabled. The liabilities are therefore driven mainly by the rates at which policyholders become sick (where sickness is defined by the policy conditions) and by the rates at which these policyholders recover or die. A 1% increase in the incidence rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $2.3 million, while a 1% decrease in the termination rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $4.1 million. While no changes to the locked in assumptions were made in 2011 or in 2009, a review of lapse experience in 2010 led to an increase in the reserve of $2.2 million. The Company also provides reinsurance of term assurance and critical illness policies written in the U.K., Ireland and the U.S. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $241 million and $220 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This increase was caused by ageing of the portfolio, which was marginally offset by movements of the U.K. Pound sterling and Euro against the U.S. dollar over 2011. Future policy benefit reserves include the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The provisions for adverse deviation in these reserves amounted to approximately $22 million and $20 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business and to treaties accepting new business up until the end of 2009, comprising underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies or becomes sick. For term assurance, the liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality and for critical illness cover, the liabilities are driven predominantly by the rates at which policyholders become sick, where sickness is defined by the treaty conditions (i.e., the morbidity rates). A 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $2.4 million, and a 1% increase in the morbidity rate would increase the value of future claims by approximately $0.9 million. The term assurance and critical illness treaties have been written using a variety of structures, some of which incur acquisition costs during an initial period. For such treaties, a deferred acquisition cost (DAC) asset has been established and an increase in future lapse rates could impact the recoverability of such costs from future premiums. The recoverability will also be influenced by the impact of lapses on future claims. An increase in the annual lapse rates by 1% could lead to a 5% 10% reduction in future margins available for amortizing the DAC asset. The Company also provided reinsurance of a block of U.S. based term assurance, which was novated to the Company from an insurance affiliate in December 2002. The future policy benefit reserves for these contracts amounted to approximately $258 million and $261 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future policy benefit reserves are established in accordance 69 with the provisions of general authoritative guidance on accounting for insurance enterprises, including the lock in of assumptions at inception with periodic review against experience. The liabilities relate to in force blocks of business, which are comprised of underlying insurance policies that provide mainly lump sum benefits if the policyholder dies. The liabilities are therefore driven by the rates of mortality, and a 1% increase in the mortality rate relative to the reserving assumption would increase the value of future claims by approximately $7 million. The liabilities are also affected by lapse experience, and a 1% decrease in lapse rates relative to the reserving assumption would increase the reserve by approximately $0.8 million. No changes to the locked in assumptions were made in 2011, 2010 or 2009. For further information see Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Future Policy Benefit Reserves. 3) Other Than Temporary Declines in Investments (OTTI) The Companys process for identifying declines in the fair value of investments that are other than temporary involves consideration of several factors. These primary factors include (i) an analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and financial condition of the issuer including consideration of credit ratings, (ii) the significance of the decline, (iii) an analysis of the collateral structure and other credit support, as applicable, of the securities in question, and (iv) for debt securities, whether the Company intends to sell such securities. In addition, the authoritative guidance requires that OTTI for certain asset backed and mortgage backed securities are recognized if the fair value of the security is less than its discounted cash flow value and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last reporting period. Where the Companys analysis of the above factors results in the Companys conclusion that declines in fair values are other than temporary, the cost of the security is written down to discounted cash flow and a portion of the previously unrealized loss is therefore realized in the period such determination is made. If the Company intends to sell an impaired debt security, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the impairment is other than temporary and is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost. There are risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary. These include subsequent significant changes in general economic conditions as well as specific business conditions affecting particular issuers, the Companys liability profile, subjective assessment of issue specific factors (seniority of claims, collateral value, etc.), future financial market effects, stability of foreign governments and economies, future rating agency actions and significant disclosure of accounting, fraud or corporate governance issues that may adversely affect certain investments. In addition, significant assumptions and management judgment are involved in determining if the decline is other than temporary. If management determines that a decline in fair value is temporary, then a securitys value is not written down at that time. However, there are potential effects upon the Companys future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of the investments are other than temporary declines. See Investment Activities herein for further information on other than temporary declines in the value of investments and unrealized loss on investments. Key Assumptions used in determination of credit losses related to fixed maturities The Company reviews, on a quarterly basis, the entirety of the securities in its investment portfolio that are in a gross unrealized loss position to assess whether it believes a credit loss, relative to the current amortized cost of the security, exists. The Company utilizes specific screening criteria to identify securities at risk for a credit loss, and if any of these conditions exists, subject the individual security to a detailed review to determine if a credit loss exists. The screening criteria used by the Company include the absolute degree of impairment of the security as a percentage of amortized cost, the credit rating of the security and the market yield to maturity of the security. Any securities that have previously been identified as impaired due to credit losses are at elevated risk of further impairments. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Company reviews any current market developments and identifies any new issues that may adversely impact the Companys investment portfolio, and reviews any impacted holdings. Credit loss methodology structured credit Credit loss on structured credit securities is determined through a comparison of the securitys discounted cash flow to the amortized cost of the security. To the extent that the discounted cash flow is estimated to be lower than the amortized cost of the security, the security is impaired to the discounted cash flow value of all security cash flows, including both coupon and principal repayment, discounted using the forward curve. The Company, in conjunction with its third party investment management service providers, makes significant assumptions in its impairment analysis and these assumptions are subject to changes in both economic fundamentals and managements estimates in future periods. (1) Non Agency RMBS The Company utilizes assumptions specific to its individual holdings and, accordingly, individual assumptions will differ on a security by security basis depending on the quality of the collateral and the performance of the underlying pools. In general, the 70 Company projects that future defaults will develop based on the performance of the underlying collateral, measured by the number of loans currently in arrears. Loans &lt; 30 days in arrears 50% will ultimately default Loans 30 60 days in arrears 60% will ultimately default Loans 60 90 days in arrears 75% will ultimately default Bank held 100% default rate Loans in foreclosure 100% default rate The Company estimates that the cumulative losses on the mortgage structures it owns will vary depending on the vintage and collateral of the underlying loans in the holdings. Cumulative deal loss expectations are projected based on the number of loans expected to take a loss and the severity of loss upon default. Loan loss severities depend on the borrower, geographic location and loan to value characteristics of the underlying collateral. The Company estimates that loss severities will range from 35 75% for sub prime and Alt A loans and 20 40% for Prime loans. These cumulative losses results are then compared to the level of subordination within the Companys holdings to measure if impairment exists. Average Cumulative Losses by Vintage 2007 2006 2005 2004 Alt A non option ARM 33 % 27 % 16 % 7 % Alt A Option ARM 43 % 36 % 20 % 11 % Prime 12 % 12 % 6 % 3 % Subprime 50 % 44 % 26 % 14 % (2) Core CDOs The Company utilizes a scenario based approach to reviewing the majority of its CDO portfolio, which consists primarily of collateralized loan obligations. The five significant scenarios utilized in the model consist of: 2 base cases assuming asset defaults are equivalent to either the expected corporate default probabilities, or the cumulative default rates for similar time frames from the period of 1983 to 2010. Optimistic/pessimistic cases assuming assets have a default rate equivalent to 1 rating notch higher/ lower than their current rating and if on positive/negative watch then 2 notches higher/lower than their current rating. A market implied scenario based on the current asset market price, assuming that lower priced loans have a higher default rate. The weighted scenario of the five scenarios above is used for the determination of a potential impairment. If losses are forecast to be below the subordination level for the tranche held by the Company, the security is determined not to be impaired. The weighting between these scenarios varies over time depending on market conditions, but the weighting used for the year end 2011 evaluation consisted of 45% to the base cases noted above, 5% to the optimistic case, 10% to the pessimistic case, and 40% to the market implied case. For the non CLO portion of the core CDO portfolio, the Company utilizes specific default scenarios related to the particular underlying assets. (3) Other structured credit assets classes The remainder of the gross unrealized losses related to the Companys structured credit portfolio are concentrated in the following significant asset classes: 71 Other ABS, which is a mix of mostly investment grade credit card, auto and non U.S. ABS structures that have risk and performance characteristics unrelated to the U.S. housing market. In cases where these sectors have met Company screens, the individual securities are evaluated based on fundamental credit analysis of the underlying structure. CMBS, which are dominated by AAA rated holdings which generally have high levels of credit subordination, are highly diversified and priced reasonably close to par. The gross unrealized losses on CMBS are spread evenly across the credit rating buckets. The Company reviews these holdings on an individual security basis to the extent they meet the screens noted above, but generally does not believe these securities to have a high risk of credit loss given their high subordination levels. Credit loss analysis corporate sector securities Credit losses on corporate securities are determined on an individual security basis. The Company reviews the circumstances and conditions associated with its credit issuers, including considering credit rating and forecast operating and financing activities of the issuer, and will make a determination as to whether it believes the issuer is likely to fully meet its contractual principal and interest obligations. To the extent the Company does not believe the issuers will meet these obligations, it recognizes a credit loss as the difference between amortized cost and the estimated present value of cash flows expected to be received. The Company reviews the ability to pay at the lowest tier (i.e., most subordinated) of the capital structure at which it holds securities, and, to the extent it is satisfied in the performance of the lower tier, concludes that any more senior tiers are also likely to meet obligations. The Company evaluates the credit losses associated with its medium term notes, which generally represent notes backed primarily by investment grade European credit. The Company evaluates the cash flows expected from the notes over their remaining expected life, including an evaluation of the likelihood of current holdings to meet their principal and interest obligations, and incorporates current reinvestment assumptions on any security maturities or reinvestment of cash flows. These cash flows are discounted at the current yield, adjusted for changes in interest rates for floating rate securities expected from these securities, and, to the extent the discounted cash flow value is below the amortized cost, recognizes an impairment charge. 4) Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company had net operating tax loss carry forward balances of $263.6 million and $282.2 million against which a valuation allowance of $239.1 million and $240.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was established. The Company had realized capital loss carry forward balances of approximately $237.2 million and $261.0 million against which a valuation allowance of approximately $237.2 million and $261.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was established. Included within these realized capital losses are $117.9 million and $142.3 million of losses arising from the intercompany sale of investments, against which a valuation allowance of $117.9 million and $142.3 million has been established. The deferral of benefits from tax losses is evaluated based upon managements estimates of the future profitability of the Companys taxable entities based on current forecasts, the character of income and the period for which losses may be carried forward. A valuation allowance may have to be established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. Should the future income of these entities fall below expectations, a further valuation allowance would have to be established, which could be significant. In addition, if any further losses are generated by these entities, these losses may not be tax affected. For further information see Other Revenues and Expenses and Item 8, Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxation. 72 5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company has recorded goodwill in connection with various acquisitions in prior years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. In accordance with FASB issued final authoritative guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company tests goodwill for potential impairment annually as of June 30 and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate that potential exists for the fair value of a reporting unit to be reduced to a level below its carrying amount. The Company tests for impairment at the reporting unit level in accordance with the authoritative guidance on intangibles and goodwill. For the reinsurance segment, a reporting unit is one level below the business segment, while for insurance, the segment is also the reporting unit. The first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to the estimated book value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is derived based upon valuation techniques and assumptions the Company believes market participants would use to value the business and this is then compared to the book value of the business. The Company derives the net book value of its reporting units by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each reporting unit. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are generally determined utilizing methodologies that incorporate price to net tangible book and price to earnings multiples of certain comparable companies, from an operational and economic standpoint. If such estimated fair value, combined with an estimate of an appropriate control premium, indicates a close call or potential impairment, further analysis using discounted cash flows is performed and the results of the various valuation methodologies are weighted to arrive at the estimated fair value for each reporting unit. A control premium represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company. If the estimated fair value exceeds the book value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the book value exceeds the estimated fair value, the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of impairment. The Company completed an interim impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2011 which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $429.0 million. The charge relates to the insurance segment. The impairment was determined using the methodologies as described above, which included discounted cash flow analyses and comparison with similar companies using their publicly traded price multiples as the basis for valuation. Continued low valuations in the insurance industry as a whole combined with several years of poor underwriting performance in the segment have impacted the technical valuations; however, management continues to see significant value in the Companys global insurance platform. For further detailed information, see Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 6) Reinsurance Premium Estimates The Company writes business on both an excess of loss and proportional basis. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the subject written premium is generally outlined within the treaty and the Company receives a minimum and or deposit premium on a quarterly basis which is normally followed by an adjustment premium based on the ultimate subject premium for the contract. The Company estimates the premium written on the basis of the expected subject premium and regularly reviews this against actual quarterly statements to revise the estimate based on the information provided by the cedant. An estimate of premium is recorded at the inception of the contract. On proportional contracts, written premiums are estimated based on expected ultimate premiums using information provided by the ceding companies. The ceding companys premium estimate may be adjusted based on its history of providing accurate premium estimates. When the actual premium is reported by the ceding company, normally on a quarterly basis, it may be materially higher or lower than the estimate. Adjustments arising from the reporting of actual premium by the ceding companies are recorded at the earliest point in time that the supporting information indicates an adjustment is appropriate. Written premiums on excess of loss contracts are earned in accordance with the loss occurring period defined within the treaty, normally 12 months following inception of the contract. Written premiums on proportional contracts are earned over the risk periods of the underlying policies issued and renewed, normally 24 months. For both excess of loss and proportional contracts, the earned premium is recognized ratably over the earning period, namely 12 24 months. The portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected in unearned premiums. Reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre defined contract terms and are fully earned when recognized. Recognition of reinstatement premiums is based on the Companys estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which involves management judgment. Reinsurance business by its nature can add further complications since, generally, the ultimate premium due under a specific contract will not be known at the time the contract is entered into. As a result, more judgment and ongoing monitoring is required to establish premiums written and earned in the Companys reinsurance operations. 73 At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of premiums receivable related to the Companys reinsurance operations amounted to $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. A significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable, which represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions, are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Management reviews the premiums receivable balance at least quarterly and provides a provision for amounts deemed to be uncollectible. The Company recorded a provision for uncollectible premiums receivable related to its reinsurance operations at December 31, 2011 and 2010 of $1.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively. The amount of proportional and excess of loss reinsurance gross premiums written and gross acquisition expenses recognized by the Companys reinsurance operations for each line of business for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 (U.S. dollars in thousands) Gross Premiums Written Gross Acquisition Expenses Gross Premiums Written Gross Acquisition Expenses Gross Premiums Written Gross Acquisition Expenses Proportional Contracts: Casualty other lines $ 115,835 $ 30,657 $ 38,671 $ 9,945 $ 44,924 $ 12,075 Casualty professional lines 65,492 19,422 51,922 14,604 41,195 12,652 Other property 693,825 145,367 651,733 168,981 703,219 164,094 Marine, energy, aviation and satellite 50,438 12,556 49,105 14,106 34,636 8,116 Other (1) 90,845 25,796 86,303 22,745 144,116 40,628 Total Proportional contracts $ 1,016,436 $ 233,798 $ 877,734 $ 230,381 $ 968,090 $ 237,565 2011 2010 2009 (U.S. dollars in thousands) Gross Premiums Written Gross Acquisition Expenses Gross Premiums Written Gross Acquisition Expenses Gross Premiums Written Gross Acquisition Expenses Excess of Loss Contracts: Property catastrophe $ 461,742 $ 43,705 $ 370,266 $ 37,720 $ 357,267 $ 33,074 Casualty other lines 176,673 26,602 190,864 30,764 173,853 34,383 Casualty professional lines 151,897 28,055 166,379 30,969 129,733 26,241 Other property 153,991 17,659 150,762 16,363 159,091 12,892 Marine, energy, aviation and satellite 105,724 9,267 68,333 6,066 54,463 5,429 Other (1) 11,338 3,399 17,655 6,361 11,978 2,642 Structured Indemnity (4,182 ) 1,257 957 2,380 4,948 2,566 Total Excess of loss contracts $ 1,057,183 $ 129,944 $ 965,216 $ 130,623 $ 891,333 $ 117,227 (1) Other includes credit and surety, whole account contracts and other lines. 74 Segments Following a streamlining of the Companys operating segments in the first quarter of 2009, the Company is organized into three operating segments: Insurance, Reinsurance and Life operations. The Companys general investment and financing operations are reflected in Corporate. The Company evaluates the performance of both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments based on underwriting profit and the performance of the Life operations segment based on its contribution to net income. Other items of revenue and expenditure of the Company are not evaluated at the segment level for reporting purposes. In addition, the Company does not allocate investment assets by segment for its P&C operations. Investment assets related to the Companys Life operations and certain structured products included in the Insurance and Reinsurance segments and in Corporate are held in separately identified portfolios. As such, net investment income from these assets is included in the contribution from each of these segments. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information, for a reconciliation of segment data to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Income Statement Analysis Insurance The following table summarizes the underwriting profit (loss) for the Insurance segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2011 % Change 2011 vs 2010 2010 % Change 2010 vs 2009 2009 Gross premiums written $ 4,824,665 9.2 % $ 4,418,380 3.9 % $ 4,251,888 Net premiums written 3,707,664 7.1 % 3,461,150 5.7 % 3,273,380 Net premiums earned 3,663,727 3.8 % 3,529,138 (0.9 )% 3,559,793 Net losses and loss expenses (2,951,413 ) 17.8 % (2,505,502 ) 4.4 % (2,399,747 ) Acquisition costs (461,965 ) 10.5 % (418,146 ) (2.6 )% (429,170 ) Operating expenses (683,814 ) 6.5 % (642,103 ) (6.8 )% (689,131 ) Underwriting profit (loss) $ (433,465 ) NM * $ (36,613 ) NM * $ 41,745 Net results structured products $ 10,976 (25.3 )% $ 14,696 (11.8 )% $ 16,660 Net fee income and other (16,370 ) 5.2 % (15,564 ) 9.3 % (14,241 ) * NM Not Meaningful Gross premiums written increased by 9.2% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 and, when evaluated in local currency, increased by 6.8%. The IPC, NAPC and Specialty business groups all experienced increased gross premiums written which were partially offset by declines from the Professional business group. The growth in premium is driven by new business growth across (i) all lines in NAPC; (ii) property and middle market lines in IPC; and (iii) general aviation and specie lines in Specialty. In addition to the new business growth outlined above, favorable foreign exchange and the renewal of long term agreements as annual policies in IPC Primary Casualty, partially offset by a large multi year program written in the fourth quarter of 2010 (discussed below), contributed to increased premiums for the segment. For the Professional business group, a reduction in gross premiums written was attributable to lower multi year deals and lower new business in U.S. Professional partially offset by new business in professional lines in international markets. Gross premiums written increased by 3.9% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 and, when evaluated in local currency, increased by 4.2%. A large proportion of the gross and net premiums written increase related to a multi year agreement with gross written premium of $126.5 million written in primary casualty during the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding this multi year program, across most lines of business, premium levels were flat, having been maintained despite continued challenging market conditions and strong competition, which continue to negatively impact new business and pricing. In addition, there have been improved retention rates across most lines of business as a result of the Companys stronger financial condition and market position since the end of 2009. New business growth in upper middle market, marine and offshore energy, active programs, U.S. general aviation, and select professional businesses has been offset by decreases in North America environmental and excess and surplus lines, the run off of a large U.S. automobile warranty program, the termination of a specialty lines aviation program in 2009 and decreases in U.S. based professional lines due to continued market pressures and pricing. Net premiums written increased by 7.1% during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010. The increase resulted from the gross premiums written increases outlined above partially offset by an increase in ceded premiums written of 16.7%. The increase in ceded premiums written relates to increased utilization of facultative reinsurance, primarily in IPC property, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, higher reinsurance premiums on certain excess of loss treaties and reinstatement premiums related to catastrophe, property and marine losses. 75 Net premiums written increased by 5.7% during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period of 2009. The increase resulted from a reduction in ceded written premiums partially offset by the increase in gross premiums written noted above. The decrease in ceded written premiums is largely related to Specialty due to cost savings from a restructuring of the marine and specie global, and property excess of loss reinsurance treaties, as well as certain adjustments to premium estimates in aviation and property which gave rise to a positive variance over 2009. Net premiums earned increased by 3.8% during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010. The increase primarily resulted from higher net written premiums earned through primary casualty, property, programs and middle markets and favorable foreign exchange impacts offset by the ceded catastrophe, property and marine reinstatement premiums noted above and the earn out of lower net premiums written in U.S. Professional and certain discontinued and environmental lines. Net premiums earned decreased by 0.9% in 2010 as compared to 2009 which was primarily a reflection of the overall reduction of net premiums written over the previous 12 to 24 months. The following table presents the ratios for the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Loss and loss expense ratio 80.6 % 71.0 % 67.4 % Underwriting expense ratio 31.2 % 30.0 % 31.4 % Combined ratio 111.8 % 101.0 % 98.8 % The loss and loss expense ratio noted above includes net losses incurred for both the reported year and any favorable or adverse prior year development of loss and loss expense reserves held at the beginning of the year. The following table summarizes the net (favorable) adverse prior year development by line of business relating to the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Property $ (8.9 ) $ (23.5 ) $ (50.7 ) Casualty and Professional (47.1 ) (105.2 ) (41.0 ) Specialty and Other (20.5 ) 2.1 28.8 Structured Indemnity (0.8 ) Total $ (76.5 ) $ (127.4 ) $ (62.9 ) Loss and loss expense ratio excluding prior year development 82.6 % 74.6 % 69.2 % In addition, the following tables present the prior year (favorable) adverse development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves within the Insurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: Gross: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 14,325 $ 14,157 $ 14,373 Gross (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year 23 (31 ) (45 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 14,348 $ 14,126 $ 14,328 Net: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 11,240 $ 11,129 $ 11,126 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (77 ) (127 ) (63 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 11,163 $ 11,002 $ 11,063 Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 8.0 loss percentage points as compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher levels of catastrophe losses occurring in the year ended December 31, 2011. Catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries and including reinstatement premiums were $219.5 million higher for year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. For further details on these catastrophe losses in 2011 see Significant Items affecting the Results of Operations 1) The impact of significant large natural catastrophe activity above. Excluding favorable prior year development and net catastrophe losses in both periods, the current accident year loss ratio increased by 2.2 points from 2010 to 2011 due to higher large loss activity in energy, property and marine businesses. Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 5.4 loss percentage points as compared to the same period in 2009 due primarily to higher levels of natural catastrophe losses occurring in 2010. Excluding favorable prior year development, natural catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums in both periods, the loss ratio increased by 1.9 points year over year largely due to several individual large loss events in property and excess casualty, adverse experience in exited lines of business and the impact of flat to slightly negative rate changes partially offset by changes in business mix and improved loss experience in aerospace. 76 For further information on the net favorable prior year reserve development for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, see Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Losses and Loss Expenses. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010 was due to an increase in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.8 points (12.6% as compared to 11.8%) and an increase in the operating expense ratio of 0.4 points (18.6% as compared to 18.2%). The increase in the acquisition expense ratio was primarily from favorable adjustment to guaranty fund assessments in 2010, higher commissions and lower amounts of fee based business in excess casualty and aerospace, as well as the impact of the catastrophe, property and marine reinstatement premiums on the ratio. The increase in the operating expense ratio was mainly as a result of increased compensation costs from certain severance costs, higher number of employees, and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 was due to a decrease in the operating expense ratio of 1.1 points (18.2% as compared to 19.3%), and a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.3 points (11.8% as compared to 12.1%). The decrease in the operating expense ratio was as a result of costs savings associated with the Companys expense reduction initiatives announced in the third quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, including changes to the Companys previously communicated operational transformation program. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio is attributable to changes in business mix partially offset by the impact of higher commission rates in certain professional, casualty and middle market lines. Net results from structured insurance products include certain structured indemnity contracts that are accounted for as deposit contracts. Net results from these contracts decreased 25.3% during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010. The decrease reflects the overall run off nature of this line of business combined with a change in the interest rate hedging strategy on one of the larger transactions during 2010. Net results from these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased compared to the same period in 2009, again reflecting the overall run off nature of this line of business. Net fee income and other improved during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010 mainly as a result of higher fee income in Specialty partially offset by higher expenses related to the Companys loss prevention consulting services. Net fee income and other decreased in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 mainly as a result of lower engineering fee income associated with the Companys loss prevention consulting services business coupled with other expenses in professional lines related to the cost of an endorsement facility with National Indemnity Company, under which National Indemnity Company issued endorsements to certain Side A directors and officers liability insurance policies underwritten by XL Specialty Insurance Company. For further information, see Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Other Investments. During the first quarter of 2010, management concluded that it did not require the $100 million extension to this endorsement facility and did not purchase the related payment obligation. 77 Reinsurance The following table summarizes the underwriting profit (loss) for this segment: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2011 % Change 2011 vs 2010 2010 % Change 2010 vs 2009 2009 Gross premiums written $ 2,073,619 12.5 % $ 1,842,951 (0.9 )% $ 1,859,423 Net premiums written 1,725,724 12.2 % 1,538,438 4.6 % 1,470,332 Net premiums earned 1,663,385 10.7 % 1,501,999 (5.7 )% 1,591,946 Net losses and loss expenses (1,126,978 ) 59.6 % (706,298 ) (8.2 )% (769,090 ) Acquisition costs (324,128 ) 1.0 % (321,008 ) (7.4 )% (346,699 ) Operating expenses (176,167 ) 0.3 % (175,586 ) (7.9 )% (190,596 ) Underwriting profit $ 36,112 (87.9 )% $ 299,107 4.7 % $ 285,561 Net results structured products 12,053 NM * 3,075 NM * 26,374 Fee income and other 3,903 56.9 % 2,488 NM * 6,209 * NM Not meaningful Gross premiums written increased by 12.5% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 and, when evaluated in local currency, increased by 8.9%. Premium growth was most significant in the International unit and was due to new motor and marine business, as well as positive amendments to prior year premium estimates. In addition, there were increased premiums in North America property on a U.S. agricultural program due to rising commodity prices in 2011, partially offset by decreases in North America casualty due to current market conditions and the non renewal of certain treaties. The growth in property catastrophe gross premiums written was through price and capacity increases, from new business in the year and from natural catastrophe reinstatement premiums partially offset by the non renewal of certain property treaties. Gross premiums written decreased by 0.9% while net premiums written increased by 4.6% during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the same period of 2009. Gross premiums written decreased by 2.2% when evaluated in the local currency. The gross premium written decrease was mainly from the North America property business where there have been lower premiums on a U.S. agricultural program due to a fall in commodity prices. In addition, the exit of certain casualty facultative markets, non renewed business, cancelations and certain reductions in price and capacity also contributed to the marginal reduction in gross premiums written. Offsetting the reduction was premium growth from the recapture of business lost during 2009 following ratings actions as well as new business in Europe, Bermuda and Asia and loss related premium adjustments in Europe. The increase in net premiums written was mainly due to the reduction in ceded written premiums as a result of a reduction in volume associated with the U.S. agricultural program already mentioned above, of which a significant portion was retroceded. Net premiums earned increased by 10.7% during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010. The increase is a reflection of the overall growth in net premiums written in 2011. In addition, reinstatement premiums on catastrophe losses, increased during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. Net premiums earned decreased by 5.7% in 2010 as compared to 2009 which is primarily a reflection of the overall reduction of net premiums written over the previous three years. The following table presents the ratios for the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Loss and loss expense ratio 67.8 % 47.0 % 48.3 % Underwriting expense ratio 30.0 % 33.1 % 33.8 % Combined ratio 97.8 % 80.1 % 82.1 % The loss and loss expense ratio includes net losses incurred in the reported year and any favorable or adverse prior year development of loss reserves held at the beginning of the year. 78 The following table summarizes the net (favorable) adverse prior year development by line of business relating to the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Property and other short tail lines $ (64.3 ) $ (145.8 ) $ (142.5 ) Casualty and other (144.1 ) (99.7 ) (80.3 ) Structured Indemnity 1.0 Total $ (208.4 ) $ (245.5 ) $ (221.8 ) Loss and loss expense ratio excluding prior year development 80.3 % 63.4 % 62.2 % In addition, the following tables present the prior year (favorable) adverse development of the Companys gross and net loss and loss expense reserves within the Reinsurance segment for the last three years ended December 31: Gross:(U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 6,206 $ 6,667 $ 7,278 Gross (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (297 ) (284 ) (257 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 5,909 $ 6,383 $ 7,021 Net: (U.S. dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves at the beginning of the year $ 5,642 $ 6,138 $ 6,559 Net (favorable) adverse development of those reserves during the year (208 ) (245 ) (222 ) Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves re estimated one year later $ 5,434 $ 5,893 $ 6,337 Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by 16.9 loss percentage points as compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher levels of catastrophe losses occurring in the year ended December 31, 2011. Catastrophe losses net of reinsurance recoveries and including reinstatement premiums were $247.3 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. For further details on these catastrophe losses in 2011 see Significant Items affecting the Results of Operations 1) The impact of significant large natural catastrophe activity above. Excluding favorable prior year development, net catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums in both periods, the loss ratio increased by 2.3 points from 2010 to 2011 mainly due to higher levels of large loss events in U.S. property including a deterioration in the performance of a large U.S. agricultural program, higher attritional losses and business mix changes. Excluding prior year development, the loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 1.2 loss percentage points as compared with the same period of 2009 attributable primarily to the impact of natural catastrophe losses and large loss events in 2010 compared to 2009. Excluding favorable prior year development, natural catastrophe losses and associated reinstatement premiums in both years ending December 31, the loss ratio decreased by 6.7 percentage points from 2009 to 2010. This improvement relates to changes in business mix as well as a lower level of loss activity in 2010 relative to 2009 in several lines including property, discontinued financial lines, and the professional and trade credit business related to the credit crisis. For further information on the net favorable prior year reserve development of $208.4 million and $245.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 see Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Losses and Loss Expenses. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010 was due to a decrease in the operating expense ratio of 1.2 points (10.5% as compared to 11.7%) and a reduction in the acquisition expense ratio of 1.9 points (19.5% as compared to 21.4%). The decrease in the operating expense ratio was due to lower compensation costs in the year ended December 31, 2011 partially offset by increased information technology expenses associated with projects such as Solvency II. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio was mainly due to the U.S. crop program where fees received were higher and profit commissions paid were lower in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010 and profit and sliding scale commissions associated with development in Latin America. The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 was due to a decrease in the acquisition expense ratio of 0.4 points (21.4% as compared to 21.8% in 2009), and by a decrease in the operating expense ratio of 0.3 points (11.7% as compared to 12.0% in 2009). The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio was a result of reduced net earned premiums in relation to the credit and bond book of business in Europe following a decision to exit these lines in 2010, which carries very high acquisition costs combined with reinstatement premium adjustments. The decrease in the operating expense ratio was as a result of cost savings associated with the Companys expense reduction initiatives announced in the third quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. 79 Net results from structured reinsurance products include certain structured indemnity contracts that are accounted for as deposit contracts. Net results from these contracts have increased during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010 due to higher interest expense in the prior year. This higher interest expense was due to an accretion rate adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2010 based on changes in expected cash flows and payout patterns on one of the larger structured indemnity contracts. Net results from these products for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased compared to the same period in 2009. This decrease was mainly due to lower net investment income as a result of lower yields and a smaller investment base, which is reflective of the run off nature of this line of business, combined with the higher 2010 year interest expense already outlined above. Fee income and other increased during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to same period of 2010 due in part to the amendment to the sales proceeds for the renewal rights of the European life, accident and health business, resulting in a charge for the prior year period. In addition, fees earned in Latin America increased during 2011 due to the extension in duration for some treaties. Fee income and other decreased by $3.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009, which included the sale of underwriting year 2009 renewal rights for the European life, accident and health business. Life Operations During 2009, the Company completed a strategic review of its life reinsurance business. In relation to this initiative, the Company sold the renewal rights to its Continental European short term life, accident and health business in December 2008. The Company also announced in March 2009 that it would run off its existing book of U.K. and Irish traditional life and annuity business, and not accept new business. In addition, during July 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its U.S. life reinsurance business. The transaction closed during the fourth quarter of 2009. In December 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to novate and recapture a number of U.K. and Irish term assurance and critical illness treaties. The transaction closed during the fourth quarter of 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company entered into an agreement to recapture three U.K. and Irish term assurance treaties, and this transaction closed in March 2010. An agreement to recapture future premiums and liabilities on two retro pool treaties was consummated in November 2010. Prior to the decision being made to run off the business, products offered included a broad range of underlying lines of life reinsurance business, including term assurances, group life, critical illness cover, immediate annuities and disability income. In addition, prior to selling the renewal rights, the products offered included short term life, accident and health business. The segment also covers a range of geographic markets, with an emphasis on the U.K., U.S., Ireland and Continental Europe.

The decrease was in line with the run off expectations following the recapture of a number of term assurance treaties during the first and fourth quarters of 2010, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange movements. Gross premiums written relating to annuity business increased due to favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Ceded premiums written increased due to foreign exchange movements. Gross premiums written relating to total life business decreased by 80 $164.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 mainly due to a $122.1 million decrease as a result of the novation of a long term care treaty and the novation/recapture of a number of term assurance treaties during the second half of 2009 and during the first and fourth quarters of 2010, together with the sale of the U.S. business during the fourth quarter of 2009 Ceded premiums written decreased by $13.4 million due to run off of the short term life, accident and health business, and following the closure of the U.S. business in 2009. Net premiums earned decreased by 5.2% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 and in the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased by 31.0% as compared to the same period in 2009. The decreases in 2011 and 2010 were consistent with the movements in total gross and net premiums written as described above. Claims and policy benefit reserves were higher by 4.1% during the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the same period of 2010, primarily due to adverse foreign exchange impacts and due to the prior year experiencing reserve releases on recaptured treaties that were not repeated this year. Claims and policy benefit reserves decreased by 24.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of the factors noted above affecting gross and net premiums written. Acquisition costs decreased by 17.9% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010, largely due to the recaptured treaties in the prior year and run off expectations outlined above. Acquisition costs decreased by 36.8% during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, largely as a result of the absence of novated/recaptured treaties from the core long term portfolio and the absence of the U.S. business; as well as decreases in line with run off expectations. Operating expenses decreased by 11.1% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 due mainly to lower compensation expenses as a result of severance costs in 2010 following the decision to place this business into run off. Operating expenses decreased by 34.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to lower compensation expenses resulting from lower headcount and lower costs related to acquisition of new business. Net investment income is included in the calculation of contribution from Life operations, as it relates to income earned on portfolios of separately identified and managed life investment assets and other allocated assets. Net investment income increased by 1.6% in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010, primarily due to positive foreign exchange impact, but was broadly in line with expected returns in underlying currencies. Net investment income decreased by 5.8% in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily as a result of negative exchange impact, as well as the absence of U.S. business in 2010. The realized losses on investments within the Life portfolio relate primarily to the sale of European hybrids and subordinated debt in European financial institutions. See Net Realized Gains and Losses and Other than Temporary Declines in the Value of Investments below for an analysis of the Companys total realized losses on investments during the year ended December 31, 2011. Investment Activities The following table illustrates the change in net investment income from P&C operations, net income (loss) from investment fund affiliates, net realized (losses) on investments, and net realized and unrealized (losses) on investment and other derivative instruments for each of the three years ended December 31: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2011 % Change 2011 vs 2010 2010 % Change 2010 vs 2009 2009 (1) Net investment income P&C operations (2) $ 819,708 (7.4 )% $ 884,866 (10.4 )% $ 987,398 Net income (loss) from investment fund affiliates (3) 26,253 (48.6 )% 51,102 (35.2 )% 78,867 Net realized (losses) on investments (4) (188,359 ) 30.4 % (270,803 ) NM * (921,437 ) Net realized and unrealized (losses) on investment and other derivative instruments (5) (10,738 ) (68.3 )% (33,843 ) 0.6 % (33,647 ) (1) Certain reclassifications have been made to conform to current year presentation. (2) Net investment income relating to P&C operations includes the net investment income related to the net results from structured products. (3) The Company generally records the income related to alternative fund affiliates on a one month lag and the private investment fund affiliates on a three month lag in order for the Company to meet the filing deadlines for its periodic reports. (4) Results up to and including March 31, 2009 include charges for OTTI related to the non credit impairment of unrealized losses. From April 1, 2009, the non credit impairment is excluded from realized losses. (5) For a summary of realized and unrealized gains and losses on all derivative instruments, see Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments. * NM Not meaningful 81 Net investment income related to P&C operations decreased in the year ended December 31, 2011 by $65.2 million as compared to the same period of 2010 due to decreasing portfolio yields and cash outflows from the investment portfolio. Overall, portfolio yields have decreased due to declining interest rates across the Companys major jurisdictions. Net investment income related to P&C operations decreased in the year ended December 31, 2010 by $102.5 million as compared to the same period in 2009 due primarily to declining portfolio yields, as a result of the impact of declines in U.S. interest rates. Net income from investment fund affiliates includes earnings from the Companys investments in closed end investment funds and partnerships and similar vehicles that are accounted for under the equity method. Net income from investment fund affiliates decreased in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. However, these results reflect weaker performance from the Companys alternative and private investment portfolios for 2011 given difficult market conditions. Performance in alternative and private funds in 2011 was challenged by volatile capital markets and the generally weaker returns to risk assets during 2011 as compared to the prior year. Net income from investment fund affiliates decreased in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. These results reflect solid results from the Companys private investment portfolio for 2010, as compared to a loss during 2009, offset by earnings from alternative funds, which were lower than the results during 2009. Performance in alternative funds in 2009 was particularly strong. Investment Performance The Company manages its fixed income securities in accordance with investment authorities approved by the Risk and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The following is a summary of the investment portfolio returns for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 of the fixed income portfolio and non fixed income portfolios: 2011 (1) 2010 (1) P&C Fixed income Portfolio USD fixed income portfolio 4.7 % 6.6 % GBP fixed income portfolio 4.4 % 5.7 % EUR fixed income portfolio 3.2 % 5.1 % Life Fixed income Portfolio USD fixed income portfolio 11.8 % 11.1 % GBP fixed income portfolio 9.5 % 9.5 % EUR fixed income portfolio 7.6 % 8.4 % Other Portfolios Alternative portfolio (2) 3.4 % 6.2 % Equity portfolio (3) (6.4 )% NM * High Yield fixed income portfolio 1.5 % 8.4 % (1) Portfolio returns are calculated by dividing the sum of the net investment income or net income from investment fund affiliates, realized gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) by the average market value of each portfolio. Performance is measured in either the underlying asset currency or the functional currency. (2) Performance on the alternative portfolio reflects the year ended November 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (3) Investment returns for the equity portfolio were negligible in 2010 and, accordingly, performance returns were not presented. * NM Not meaningful Net Realized Gains and Losses on Investments and Other than Temporary Declines in the Value of Investments Net realized losses on investments for the year ended December 31, 2011 included net realized losses of approximately $160.2 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys fixed income investments. In addition, included in the net realized losses noted above are net realized losses of $28.2 million due primarily to losses from sales of investments, principally, on European financials and non Agency RMBS offset partially by gains from sales of Agency MBS and Government and Government Related and Supported securities. The significant components of the net impairment charges of $160.2 million were: For structured credit securities, the Company recorded net impairments of $78.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company determined that the likely recovery on these securities was below the carrying value and, accordingly, recorded an impairment of the securities to the discounted value of the cash flows of these securities. The Company recorded impairments totaling $31.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to medium term notes backed primarily by investment grade European investment grade credit. The Company adjusted the estimated remaining holding period of certain notes resulting in a shorter reinvestment spectrum. For corporate securities, excluding medium term notes, the Company recorded net impairments totaling $6.5 million, principally on hybrid securities, for the year ended December 31, 2011. 82 The Company recorded impairments of $44.0 million related primarily to foreign exchange losses arising on U.S. dollar denominated securities held in a Swiss franc functional currency entity and foreign exchange losses on U.K. sterling denominated securities held in U.S. dollar portfolios. The foreign exchange losses are recorded as part of the foreign currency revaluation process; however, because the Companys consolidated reporting currency is U.S. dollars, the foreign exchange impairment recorded on these securities is fully offset by a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment gain recorded upon the consolidation of the foreign currency entity. Net realized losses in the year ended December 31, 2010 included net realized losses of $205.1 million related to the write down of certain of the Companys fixed income, equity and other investments with respect to which the Company determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of those investments as well as $65.7 million from sales of investments. Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses on Derivatives Net realized and unrealized losses on investment derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 resulted from the Companys investment strategy to manage interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk, and to replicate permitted investments.

Financial operating affiliate income increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period of 2009 due to the sale of a significant portion of the Companys shareholding in Primus Guaranty Ltd. For further information on the sale of Primus shares, see Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments in Affiliates. Investment manager affiliate income increased substantially in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010, reflecting the positive impact of the sale of the Companys ownership stake in Finisterre, and strong results from certain investment manager affiliates in the current year, compared to solid broad based results in the same period of 2010. Investment manager affiliate income increased during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period of 2009 primarily as a result of positive capital market conditions since the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the challenging conditions for alternative asset managers reported in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first two quarters of 2009. Finally, the Company also benefited in 2010 from a $4.4 million gain associated with the sale of its stake in one of the investment manager affiliates. 83 Strategic operating affiliate income decreased in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of 2010 due to current year losses from an insurance affiliate catastrophe bond fund and from the Companys Brazilian joint venture ITA&Uacute; XL Seguros Corporativos S.A. (ITAU), which was sold during the second quarter of 2010. Income from other strategic operating affiliates decreased during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period of 2009 mainly due to lower earnings in 2010 relating to an insurance affiliate which largely writes direct U.S. homeowners insurance and lower earnings due to the sale of ITAU during the second quarter of 2010. For the full year of 2011, foreign exchange gains were produced as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar against U.K. sterling, the Brazilian real and the Swiss franc, which more than offset losses that were driven by a stronger Australian dollar. In the year ended December 31, 2010, foreign exchange gains were marginal as a result of a limited overall movement in the value of the U.S. dollar during the period. Foreign exchange gains in the year ended December 31, 2011 were produced as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar against U.K. sterling, the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Swiss franc, which more than offset losses that were driven by a stronger Australian dollar. Foreign exchange gains in the year ended December 31, 2010 were marginal as a result of a limited overall movement in the value of the U.S. dollar during the period. The U.S. dollar was stronger against the Euro, while weakening against the Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real. In the year ended December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened against all of the Companys major currency exposures, particularly the Canadian dollar and U.K. sterling, generating a loss for that period. Corporate operating expenses increased by 75.2% in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 primarily as a result of certain strategic corporate initiatives taking place in 2011. Corporate operating expenses decreased by 15.9% during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the restructuring costs incurred during 2009. Interest expense includes costs related to the Companys debt and collateral facilities as well as certain deposit liability accretion which is not included in Net investment results structured products. Interest expense decreased in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 as a result of the overall reduction in the Companys debt following the purchase and retirement of the $500 million 8.25% Senior Notes in August 2011 and the sale of $400 million 5.75% Senior Notes in September 2011. In June 2010, interest rate contracts designed as fair value hedges of certain issues of the Companys notes payable and debt were settled. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 decreased as a result of the Companys debt hedging activities where the effective portion of the hedging relationship is amortizing through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. Due in part to continued losses in certain businesses within the Insurance segment and continued low industry market valuations, which impacts certain assumptions used in the goodwill discounted cash flow valuation test such as the selected discount rate and related risk premium, the Company performed an interim impairment test for goodwill subsequent to its annual testing date of June 30. The interim impairment test resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $429.0 million recorded representing a write off of all goodwill associated with the Insurance segment. For further information, see Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and see further discussion under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Amortization of intangible assets was flat for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 and 2009. The tax charge of $59.7 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2011 included a benefit of $11.9 million arising as a result of a change in an overseas tax rule adopted in the quarter ended June 30, 2011. The Company has incurred a tax charge in 2011 notwithstanding reporting net losses due to the distribution of operating profits across the organization and the impact of internal reinsurance. In addition, net profits were recorded in certain jurisdictions due to the distribution of prior year development. A tax benefit of $11.5 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011 in respect of the non cash goodwill impairment charge of $429.0 million. The increase in the Companys income taxes in 2010 as compared to 2009 arose principally from the increase in the profitability of the Companys U.S. and European operations in 2010. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Item 8, Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxation. 84 BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Investments At December 31, 2011 and 2010, total investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net receivable for investments sold were $35.9 billion and $35.8 billion, respectively.

(2) U.S. Government and Government Related/Supported and Non U.S. Sovereign Government, Provincials, Supranational and Government Related include government related securities with an amortized cost of $1,878.3 million and fair value of $1,915.6 million and U.S. Agencies with an amortized cost of $494.0 million and fair value of $541.2 million. (3) Included in Corporate Financials are gross unrealized losses of $108.8 million on Tier One and upper Tier Two securities of financial institutions (Hybrids) with fair value of $386.1 million, as well as gross unrealized losses of $70.1 million on subordinated debt (including lower Tier Two securities) with a fair value of $701.3 million. (4) Included within Corporate are certain floating rate medium term notes supported primarily by pools of European investment grade credit with varying degrees of leverage. The notes have a fair value of $266.0 million and an amortized cost of $297.7 million. These securities have been allocated ratings of the underlying pool of securities. These notes allow the investor to participate in cash flows of the underlying bonds including certain residual values, which could serve to either decrease or increase the ultimate values of these notes. (5) Included within equity securities are investments in fixed income funds of $91.6 million and nil at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 85 The Company reviews on a regular basis its corporate debt investments to consider its concentration, credit quality and compliance with established guidelines. At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, the average credit quality of the Companys total fixed income portfolio (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net receivable/(payable) for investment sold/(purchased)) was Aa2/AA. Included in the table below are the credit ratings of the fixed income portfolio excluding operating cash at December 31, 2011 and 2010: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (U.S. dollars in thousands) Investments by Credit Rating (1)(2) Carrying Value Percent of Total Carrying Value Percent of Total AAA $ 16,276 51.1 % $ 16,944 52.0 % AA 5,266 16.6 % 5,058 15.5 % A 7,098 22.3 % 7,288 22.3 % BBB 2,418 7.6 % 2,182 6.7 % BB and below 718 2.3 % 1,142 3.5 % Not rated 39 0.1 % 6 0.0 % Total $ 31,815 100.0 % $ 32,620 100 % (1) Included in the above are $266.0 million or 0.8% of the portfolio that represents medium term notes rated at the average credit rating of the underlying asset pools backing the notes. (2) The credit rating for each asset reflected above was principally determined based on the weighted average rating of the individual securities from Standard & Poors, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. U.S. agencies paper, whether with implicit or explicit government support, reflect the credit quality rating of the U.S. government for the purpose of these calculations. Gross and Net Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments At December 31, 2011, the Company had net unrealized gains on available for sale fixed maturities and short term investments of $418.0 million. Gross unrealized losses on these investments were $776.6 million. The information presented below for the gross unrealized losses on the Companys investments at December 31, 2011 shows the potential effect upon future earnings and financial position should management later conclude that some of the current declines in the fair value of these investments are other than temporary. Realized losses or impairments, depending on their magnitude, may have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations. The decrease in net unrealized losses on investments during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to losses realized during the year and marginally favorable market movements.

For further information, see Item 8, Note 5, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As noted in Item 8, Note 2, to the Consolidated Financial Statements Significant Accounting Policies, the determination of the amount of OTTI varies by investment type and is based upon managements periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management considers a wide range of factors about the securities and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery. Inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects additional impairments in net income as determinations are made. Managements determination of the amount of the impairment taken on investments is highly subjective and could adversely impact the Companys results of operations. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of OTTI taken and reflected in the Companys financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. Levels of write down or OTTI are also impacted by the Companys assessment of the intent to sell securities that have declined in value prior to recovery. If, due to changes in circumstances, the Company determines to reposition or realign portions of the portfolio and the Company determines not to hold certain securities in an unrealized loss position to recovery, then the Company will incur OTTI charges, which could be significant. 87 Gross Unrealized Gains and Losses Management, in its assessment of whether securities in a gross unrealized loss position are temporarily impaired, considers the significance of the impairments. The Company had structured credit securities with gross unrealized losses of $84.4 million, with a fair value of $39.6 million, which at December 31, 2011 had cumulative fair value declines of greater than 50% of amortized costs. All of these are mortgage and asset backed securities. The Company has evaluated each of these securities in conjunction with its investment manager service providers and believes it is more likely than not that the issuer will be able to fund sufficient principal and interest payments to support the current amortized cost. These securities include gross unrealized losses of $61.2 million on non Agency RMBS, $22.6 million on Core CDOs and $0.7 million on CMBS holdings. Net Unrealized Gains and Losses Corporate Financial Sector Securities At December 31, 2011, approximately $1.2 billion of the Companys $3.7 billion in corporate financial sector securities was held in the portfolios supporting the Companys Life operations portfolio representing 91.1% of the net unrealized losses on this asset class. The assets associated with that business are more heavily weighted towards longer term securities from financial institutions, including a significant portion of the Companys Tier 1 and Upper Tier 2 securities, representing committed term debt and hybrid instruments senior to the common and preferred equity of the financial institutions. Financials held in Life portfolios accounted for $115.8 million of the Companys net unrealized loss at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, approximately 43% of the overall sensitivity to interest rate risk and 35% to credit risk was related to the Life operations portfolio, despite these portfolios accounting for only 21% of the fixed income portfolio. 88 Net Unrealized Gains and Losses Structured Securities The following table details the current exposures to structured credit portfolios excluding Agency MBS within the Companys fixed income portfolio as well as the current net unrealized (loss) gain position at December 31, 2011 and 2010: December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 (U.S. dollars in millions) Holding at Carrying Value Percent of Fixed Income Portfolio Net Unrealized (Loss) Gain Holding at Carrying Value Percent of Fixed Income Portfolio Net Unrealized (Loss) Gain Non Agency RMBS: Sub prime first lien mortgages $ 295.5 1.0 % $ (137.0 ) $ 395.1 1.2 % $ (142.4 ) Alt A mortgages 114.5 0.4 % (39.7 ) 198.0 0.6 % (53.7 ) Second lien mortgages (including sub prime second lien mortgages) 26.5 0.1 % (6.1 ) 33.1 0.1 % (7.8 ) Prime RMBS 158.3 0.5 % (26.3 ) 311.6 0.9 % (28.2 ) Other assets 128.0 0.4 % 5.8 169.7 0.5 % (3.3 ) Total exposure to Non Agency RMBS 722.8 2.4 % (203.3 ) 1,107.5 3.3 % (235.4 ) Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities 974.8 3.3 % 47.2 1,172.5 3.5 % 37.4 Core CDOs (1) 662.9 2.3 % (185.6 ) 733.5 2.2 % (186.6 ) Other Structured 1,266.8 4.3 % 11.8 1,245.4 3.7 % (19.0 ) Total Non Agency Structured Securities $ 3,627.3 12.3 % $ (329.9 ) $ 4,258.9 12.7 % $ (403.6 ) (1) The Company defines Core CDOs as investments in non subprime collateralized debt obligations, which primarily consisted of collateralized loan obligations. At December 31, 2011, the Companys sub prime and Alt A exposures had adequate underlying loan characteristics and the Company believed at such date that the current amortized cost levels were at or below the discounted cash flow value of the holdings, based on an analysis of subordination levels relative to current expectations of house price declines, loss severities and default levels. The Company had approximately $340.9 million of Non Agency RMBS downgraded during the year ended December 31, 2011. However, 55.2% of the Companys holdings remain rated investment grade at December 31, 2011. Refer to Significant Items Affecting the Results of Operations for further discussion surrounding the impact of credit market movements on the Companys investment portfolio. European Sovereign Debt Crisis The ongoing global financial crisis has led to the deterioration of economies globally, as sovereign governments have reacted to the crisis by further increasing public expenditures in order to provide stimulus and security, which has created significant budgetary shortfalls. Several key nations within the European Union particularly the GIIPS countries have suffered a high level of fiscal distress and economic vulnerability due to overreliance on external credit sources and imprudent borrowing and other monetary practices. This has raised doubts within the global financial community as to whether these sovereign nations will remain able to service their own debt obligations both at a national and local level. The Companys primary exposure to this European sovereign debt crisis is from direct investment in fixed maturity securities issued by GIIPS national and local governments, as well as from fixed maturity securities issued by certain financial and non financial corporate entities operating within GIIPS. The Company continues to monitor its financial exposure to this crisis, and continually assesses the impact of a potential default by any of GIIPS on their respective debt issuances, including the associated impact on non sovereign entities in these nations in the event of such a default. With regard to non sovereign securities, the Company considers a security to be at risk if the security issuers main operations are physically located within GIIPS, as opposed to where the issuer is legally domiciled. The Company currently has no unfunded investment exposures or commitments to either sovereign or non sovereign entities within these EU nations. The Company does invest in various alternative and private investment funds that from time to time may invest in securities or investments related to these five EU nations. Currently these are not material exposures. 89 The following is an analysis of the Companys AFS and HTM fixed maturity investment exposures related to this GIIPS crisis at December 31, 2011 and the contractual maturities of these securities. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

For further details on these balances including the names of the Companys most significant reinsurance counterparties see Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Reinsurance. Other sources of potential exposure to European credit issues may exist within certain lines of insurance or reinsurance business written (including but not limited to lines such as surety, business interruption, and political risk), or within underlying investments held in securitized financial instruments or in structured transactions in which the Company has an interest. Management considers these potential exposures as part of its ongoing enterprise risk management processes. Fair Value Measurements of Assets and Liabilities As described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Fair Value Measurements, effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and accordingly has provided required disclosures by level within the fair value hierarchy of the Companys assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value. As defined in the hierarchy, those assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3 have valuations determined using unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs may include the entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions, applied to a modeled valuation however, this is not the case with respect to the Companys Level 3 assets and liabilities. The vast majority of the assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 are made up of those securities for which the values were obtained from brokers where either significant inputs were utilized in determining the value that were difficult to corroborate with observable market data, or sufficient information regarding the specific inputs utilized by the broker were not obtained to support a Level 2 classification or the Company utilized internal valuation models. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, certain collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that were previously classified as Level 2 due to sufficient market data being available to allow a price to be determined and provided by third party pricing vendors, were transferred to Level 3 because third party vendor prices were no longer believed to be the most appropriate pricing source. Broker quotes, for which sufficient information regarding the specific inputs utilized by the broker was not available to support a Level 2 classification, are the primary source of the valuations for these CDO securities. 90 Controls over Valuation of Financial Instruments The Company performs quarterly reviews of the prices received from its third party valuation sources to assess if the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. This process is completed by investment and accounting personnel who are independent of those responsible for obtaining the valuations. The approaches taken by the Company include, but are not limited to, annual reviews of the controls of the external parties responsible for sourcing valuations which are subjected to automated tolerance checks, quarterly reviews of the valuation sources and dates, and monthly reconciliations between the valuations provided by our external parties and valuations provided by our third party investment managers at a portfolio level. In addition, the Company relies on valuation controls performed by external parties responsible for sourcing appropriate valuations from third parties on the Companys behalf. The approaches taken by these external parties to gain comfort include, but are not limited to, comparing valuations between external sources, completing recurring reviews of third party pricing services methodologies and reviewing controls of the third party service providers to support the completeness and accuracy of the prices received. Valuation Methodology of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Refer to Item 8, Notes 2 and 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, Significant Accounting Policies and Fair Value Measurements for a description of the valuation methodology utilized to value Level 3 assets and liabilities, how the valuation methodology is validated as well as further details associated with various assets classified as Level 3. At December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any liabilities that were carried at fair value based on Level 3 inputs other than derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2011. Fair Value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities At December 31, 2011, the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities as a percentage of the Companys total assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Total Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value at December 31, 2011 Fair Value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Level 3 Assets and Liabilities as a Percentage of Total Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value, by class Assets Fixed maturities, at fair value U.S. Government and Government agency Related/Supported $ 1,990,983 $ % Corporate 10,462,515 23,818 0.2 % Residential mortgage backed securities Agency 5,379,406 32,041 0.6 % Residential mortgage backed securities Non Agency 641,815 % Commercial mortgage backed securities 974,835 % Collateralized debt obligations 658,602 650,851 98.8 % Other asset backed securities 986,356 16,552 1.7 % U.S. States and political subdivisions of the States 1,797,378 % Non U.S. Sovereign Government, Supranational and Government Related 3,298,135 % Total Fixed maturities, at fair value 26,190,025 $ 723,262 2.8 % Equity securities, at fair value 468,197 % Short term investments, at fair value 359,063 % Total investments available for sale $ 27,017,285 $ 723,262 2.7 % Cash equivalents (1) 2,754,365 % Other investments (2) 661,557 113,959 17.2 % Other assets (3) 65,734 % Total assets carried at fair value $ 30,498,941 $ 837,221 2.7 % Liabilities Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased (4) $ 20,844 $ % Other liabilities (5) 58,706 42,644 72.6 % Total liabilities carried at fair value $ 79,550 $ 42,644 53.6 % (1) Cash equivalents balances subject to fair value measurements include certificates of deposit and money market funds. 91 (2) The Other investments balance excludes certain structured transactions including certain investments in project finance transactions and a payment obligation (as described in Note 7, Other Investments), that has provided liquidity financing to a structured credit vehicle as a part of a third party medium term note facility. These Other investments are carried at amortized cost that totaled $323.7 million at December 31, 2011 and $327.7 million at December 31, 2010. (3) Other assets include derivative instruments, reported on a gross basis. (4) Financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased are included within Net payable for investments purchased on the balance sheet. (5) Other liabilities include derivative instruments, reported on a gross basis. At December 31, 2011, the Companys Level 3 assets represented approximately 2.7% of assets that are measured at fair value and less than 2% of total assets. The Companys Level 3 liabilities represented approximately 53.6% of liabilities that are measured at fair value and less than 1% of total liabilities at December 31, 2011. Changes in the Fair Value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities See Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Fair Value Measurements, for an analysis of the change in fair value of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses The Company establishes reserves to provide for estimated claims, the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process and losses incurred but not reported. These reserves are calculated using actuarial and other reserving techniques to project the estimated ultimate net liability for losses and loss expenses. The Companys reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflects managements judgment concerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claims made against the Company. Unpaid losses and loss expenses totaled $20.6 billion and $20.5 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The table below represents a reconciliation of the Companys P&C unpaid losses and loss expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011: (U.S. dollars in thousands) Gross unpaid losses and loss expenses Unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable Net unpaid losses and loss expenses Balance at December 31, 2010 $ 20,531,607 $ (3,649,290 ) $ 16,882,317 Losses and loss expenses incurred 5,172,367 (1,093,976 ) 4,078,391 Losses and loss expenses paid/recovered (4,911,737 ) 1,065,535 (3,846,202 ) Foreign exchange and other (178,336 ) 47,803 (130,533 ) Balance at December 31, 2011 $ 20,613,901 $ (3,629,928 ) $ 16,983,973 While the Company reviews the adequacy of established reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses regularly, no assurance can be given that actual claims made and payments related thereto will not be in excess of the amounts reserved. In the future, if such reserves develop adversely, such deficiency would have a negative impact on future results of operations. See Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and Item 8, Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Losses and Loss Expenses, for further discussion. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit the Companys losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve the Company of its ultimate liability to the Companys insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on the balance sheet represent the Companys total unpaid gross losses. Unpaid losses and loss expense recoverable relates to estimated reinsurance recoveries on the unpaid loss and loss expense reserves. 92 The table below presents the Companys net paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2011 and 2010: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Reinsurance balances receivable $ 263,877 $ 225,129 Reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits 25,020 22,597 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 3,685,260 3,717,405 Bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (99,192 ) (121,917 ) Net paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable $ 3,874,965 $ 3,843,214 The Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due. Of the $3.9 billion total unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2011, one individual reinsurer accounted for greater than 15% of the total. The Company is the beneficiary of letters of credit, trust accounts and funds withheld in the aggregate amount of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2011, collateralizing reinsurance recoverables with respect to certain reinsurers. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies. As at December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had a reserve for potential non recoveries from reinsurers of $99.2 million and $121.9 million, respectively. Approximately 92.2% of the total net unpaid loss and loss expense recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable (net of collateral held) outstanding at December 31, 2011, were due from reinsurers with a financial strength rating of A or better. The following is an analysis of the total recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable at December 31, 2011, by reinsurers owing more than 3% of such total: Name of reinsurer Reinsurer Financial Strength Rating % of total Munich Reinsurance Company AA /Stable 22.8 % Swiss Reinsurance Company AA /Stable 12.2 % Swiss Re Europe S.A.

As a global insurance and reinsurance company, one of the Companys principal responsibilities to its clients is to ensure that the Company has ready access to funds with which to settle large unforeseen claims. The Company would generally expect that positive cash flow from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most future loss scenarios. However, there is a possibility that unforeseen demands could be placed on the Company due to extraordinary events and as such the Companys liquidity needs may change. Such events include, among other things, several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time resulting in material incurred losses; rating agency downgrades of the Companys core insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries that would require posting of collateral in connection with the Companys letter of credit and revolving credit facilities, return of unearned premium and or the settlement of derivative transactions and large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables), etc. Any one or a combination of such events may cause a liquidity strain for the Company. In addition, a liquidity strain could also occur in an illiquid market, such as that which was experienced in 2008. Investments that may be used to meet liquidity needs in the event of a liquidity strain may not be liquid, given inactive markets, or may have to be sold at a significant loss as a result of depressed prices. Because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the consolidated group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. As a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. If such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, XL Ireland may be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations which may be difficult given that XL Ireland is a holding company and has limited liquidity. A downgrade below A of the Companys principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by either S&P or A.M. Best, which is two notches below the current S&P financial strength rating of A (Stable) and the A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Stable) of these subsidiaries, may trigger cancelation provisions in a significant amount of the Companys assumed reinsurance agreements and may potentially require the Company to return unearned premiums to cedants. In addition, due to collateral posting requirements under the Companys letter of credit and revolving credit facilities, such a downgrade may require the posting of cash collateral in support of certain in use portions of these facilities. Specifically, a downgrade below A by A.M. Best would constitute an event of default under the Companys three largest credit facilities and may trigger such collateral requirements. In certain limited instances, such downgrades may require the Company to return cash or assets to counterparties or to settle derivative and or other transactions with the respective counterparties. See Item 1A, Risk Factors A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. Holding Company Liquidity As holding companies, XL Ireland and XL Cayman have no operations of their own and their assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Accordingly, XL Irelands and XL Caymans future cash flows largely depend on the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from subsidiaries. The ability to pay such dividends is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the various countries and states in which these subsidiaries operate, including, among others, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the U.S., New York, Ireland, Switzerland and the U.K. See Item 8, Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Statutory Financial Data, for further discussion and details regarding dividend capacity of the Companys major operating subsidiaries. See Risk Factors Our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends, make payments on our debt securities and make other payments. The ability to pay such dividends is also limited by the regulations of the Society of Lloyds and certain contractual provisions. No assurance can be given that the Companys subsidiaries will pay dividends in the future to XL Ireland or XL Cayman. Under Irish law, share premium was required to be converted to distributable reserves for the Company to have the ability to pay cash dividends and redeem and buyback shares following the Redomestication. On July 23, 2010, the Irish High Court approved XL Irelands conversion of share premium to $5.0 billion of distributable reserves, subject to the completion of certain formalities under Irish Company law. These formalities were completed in early August 2010. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 XL Ireland had $4.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, in distributable reserves. During 2009, management changed the internal ownership structure of certain of the Companys operating subsidiaries in Bermuda and Ireland in order to more efficiently utilize capital and to improve overall liquidity. In connection with these changes, certain dividends were paid to XL Cayman by operating subsidiaries. At December 31, 2011, XL Ireland and XL Cayman held cash and investments, net of liabilities associated with cash sweeping arrangements, of $1.6 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, compared to $2.8 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. 94 XL Irelands principal uses of liquidity are ordinary share related transactions including dividend payments to holders of its ordinary shareholders as well as share buybacks, capital investments in its subsidiaries and certain corporate operating expenses. XL Caymans principal uses of liquidity are preference share related transactions including dividend payments to its preference shareholders as well as preference share buybacks from time to time, interest and principal payments on debt and certain corporate operating expenses. All outstanding debt of the Company at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was issued by XL Cayman except for the $600 million XLCFE Notes which were issued by XLCFE and were repaid at maturity on January 15, 2012. Both XL Cayman and XLCFE are wholly owned subsidiaries of XL Ireland. Certain of XL Caymans outstanding debt is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by XL Ireland. The Companys ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries to satisfy any of its obligations under guarantees is subject to certain contractual restrictions, applicable laws and statutory requirements of the various countries in which the Company operates, including, among others, Bermuda, the United States, Ireland, Switzerland and the U.K. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, required statutory capital and surplus for the principal operating subsidiaries of the Company was $6.7 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. XL Ireland and its subsidiaries provide no guarantees or other commitments (express or implied) of financial support to the Companys subsidiaries or affiliates, except for such guarantees or commitments that are in writing. See Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Sources of Liquidity for the Company At December 31, 2011, the consolidated Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.8 billion as compared to approximately $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010. There are three main sources of cash flows for the Company those provided by operations, investing activities and financing activities. Operating Cash Flows Historically, cash receipts from operations, consisting of premiums and investment income, generally have provided sufficient funds to pay losses as well as operating expenses of the Companys subsidiaries and to fund dividends to XL Ireland. However, as a result of the combination of current soft market conditions, the decision to put the Life operations segment and certain P&C lines into run off and lower investment yields, operating cash flows are lower in 2011 than in the prior year. Cash receipts from operations are generally derived from the receipt of investment income on the Companys investment portfolio as well as the net receipt of premiums less claims and expenses related to the Companys underwriting activities in its P&C operations as well as its Life operations segment. The Companys operating subsidiaries provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies related to such premiums. Premiums and acquisition expenses are settled based on terms of trade as stipulated by an underwriting contract, and generally are received within the first year of inception of a policy when the premium is written, but can be up to three years on certain reinsurance business assumed. Operating expenses are generally paid within a year of being incurred. Claims, especially for casualty business, may take a much longer time before they are reported and ultimately settled, requiring the establishment of reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses. Therefore, the amount of claims paid in any one year is not necessarily related to the amount of net losses incurred, as reported in the consolidated statement of income. During the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $327.2 million compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of $594.8 million for the same period in 2010. This reduction was primarily due to P&C net loss and loss expenses paid of $3.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with $3.5 billion for the same period in 2010. This increase was due primarily to higher loss payments in the insurance segment in 2011 relating to the prior and current year catastrophes and other individual large property and excess casualty loss payments. During the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash flows provided by operating activities were $594.8 million compared to net cash flows used of $42.8 million for the same period in 2009. The cash flows provided in 2010 resulted primarily from lower levels of cash payments for claims from previous underwriting years being offset by cash received as premium. In 2009, the cash flows used in operating activities were primarily as a result of cash payments for claims associated with Hurricanes Ike and Gustav losses. Investing Cash Flows Generally, positive cash flow from operations and financing activities is invested in the Companys investment portfolio, including affiliates or acquisition of subsidiaries. 95 Net cash provided by investing activities was $832.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to net cash provided of $261.5 million for the same period in 2010. The 2011 cash inflow was mainly associated with the normal purchase and sale of portfolio investments. Net cash provided by investing activities was $261.5 million in 2010 compared to net cash provided of $214.6 million for 2009. The 2010 cash inflow was mainly associated with normal purchase and sale of portfolio investments. Certain of the Companys invested assets are held in trust and pledged in support of insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Such pledges are largely required by the Companys operating subsidiaries that are non admitted under U.S. state insurance regulations, in order for the U.S. cedant to receive statutory credit for reinsurance. Also, certain deposit liabilities and annuity contracts require the use of pledged assets. As further outlined in Item 8, Note 17(f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies Letters of Credit, certain assets of the investment portfolio are collateralized for the Companys letter of credit facilities. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $17.2 billion and $16.1 billion in pledged assets, respectively. Financing Cash Flows Cash flows related to financing activities include ordinary and preferred share related transactions, the payment of dividends, the issue or repayment of debt and deposit liability transactions. On November 2, 2010, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share buyback program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $1.0 billion of its ordinary shares. During 2010, the Company purchased and canceled 6.9 million ordinary shares under this program for $144.0 million. During 2011, the Company purchased and canceled 31.7 million ordinary shares under this program for $665.5 million. All share buybacks were carried out by way of redemption in accordance with Irish law and the Companys constitutional documents. All shares so redeemed were canceled upon redemption. At both December 31, 2011 and February 24, 2012, $190.5 million remained available to be used for purchases under this program. During the third quarter of 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a share buyback program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $500.0 million of its ordinary shares. During 2010, the Company purchased and canceled 18.8 million ordinary shares for $375.4 million under this program which was the full amount that had been remaining at January 1, 2010 under this program. On September 30, 2011, XL Cayman completed the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 at the issue price of 100% of the principal amount. The 5.75% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by XL Ireland. The 5.75% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per annum, payable semiannually, beginning on April 1, 2012, and mature on October 1, 2021. XL Cayman may redeem the 5.75% Senior Notes, in whole or part, from time to time in accordance with the terms of the indenture pursuant to which the 5.75% Senior Notes were issued. XL Cayman received net proceeds of approximately $395.9 million from the offering, which were used to partially repay the $600 million XLCFE Notes. On October 15, 2011, XL Cayman issued 350,000 non cumulative Series D Preference Ordinary Shares for $350 million of cash and liquid investments that were held in a trust account that was part of the Stoneheath facility. Holders of the Stoneheath Securities received one Series D Preference Ordinary Share in exchange for each Stoneheath Security. See Contingent Capital below. During the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash flows used in financing activities were $358.7 million compared to net cash outflows of $1.5 billion for the same period in 2010. The 2011 net cash outflows related primarily to the buybacks of the Companys ordinary shares, as outlined above, the repurchase of all outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares, the payment of ordinary and preferred share dividends and the repayment of deposit liabilities, partially offset by the proceeds of issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes and the proceeds of issuance of the Series D Preference Ordinary Shares, as described above. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.5 billion in 2010 compared to net cash used of $1.0 billion in 2009. The 2010 net cash outflows related primarily to the redemption of Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares, purchase of the Companys ordinary shares as outlined above, settlement of $450 million of outstanding funding agreement liabilities, repayment of other deposit liabilities and the payment of ordinary and preferred dividends. For more information on the repurchase of debt, see Item 1, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Share Capital. During the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash outflows related primarily to the repayment of debt and deposit liabilities and the payment of common and preferred dividends. Following the settlement of the purchase contracts associated with the 7.0% equity security units in February 2009, the Company issued 11,461,080 ordinary shares for net proceeds of approximately $743.1 million, which was used to retire the senior notes previously due February 2011, which had a fixed coupon of 5.25%. On March 26, 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer for a portion of its outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares that resulted in approximately 12.7 million Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation value of $317.3 96 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $104.7 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, combined with professional fees totaling $0.8 million. The Company is a Well Known Seasoned Issuer (WKSI) as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Company maintains a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 and is eligible to file automatically effective registration statements in the future for the potential offering and sale of an unlimited amount of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for various types of securities to be offered, including the following (i) ordinary shares, preference shares, debt securities, ordinary share warrants, ordinary share purchase contracts and ordinary share purchase units of XL Ireland, (ii) guarantees by XL Ireland of XL Cayman debt securities and (iii) debt securities of XL Cayman. In addition the Company maintains letter of credit facilities which provide liquidity. Details of these facilities are described below in Capital Resources. Capital Resources At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had total shareholders equity of $10.8 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively. In addition to ordinary share capital, the Company depends on external sources of financing to support its underwriting activities in the form of: a. debt; b. preference shares; c. letter of credit facilities and other sources of collateral; and d. revolving credit facilities. In particular, the Company requires, among other things: sufficient capital to maintain its financial strength and credit ratings, as issued by several ratings agencies, at levels considered necessary by management to enable the Companys key operating subsidiaries to compete; sufficient capital to enable its regulated subsidiaries to meet the regulatory capital levels required in the United States, the U.K., Bermuda, Ireland, Switzerland and other key markets; letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are required to be posted or deposited, as the case may be, by the Companys operating subsidiaries that are non admitted under U.S. state insurance regulations in order for the U.S. cedant to receive statutory credit for reinsurance. The Company also uses letters of credit to support its operations at Lloyds; and revolving credit to meet short term liquidity needs. The following risks are associated with the Companys requirement to renew its credit facilities: the credit available from banks may be reduced, resulting in the Companys need to pledge its investment portfolio to customers. This could result in a lower investment yield; the Company may be downgraded by one or more rating agencies, which could materially and negatively impact the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity; and the volume of business that the Companys subsidiaries that are not admitted in the United States are able to transact could be reduced if the Company is unable to renew its letter of credit facilities at an appropriate amount. Continued consolidation within the banking industry may result in the aggregate amount of credit provided to the Company being reduced. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by identifying and or selecting additional banks that can participate in the credit facilities upon renewal. See Item 1A, Risk Factors. 97 The following table summarizes the components of the Companys current capital resources at December 31, 2011 and 2010: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares $ $ 71,900 Series D preference ordinary shares 345,000 Series E preference ordinary shares 999,500 1,000,000 Ordinary share capital 9,424,910 9,613,049 Total ordinary and non controlling interests capital $ 10,769,410 $ 10,684,949 Notes payable and debt 2,264,618 2,446,735 Total capital $ 13,034,028 $ 13,131,684 Ordinary Share Capital The following table reconciles the opening and closing ordinary share capital positions at December 31, 2011 and 2010: (U.S. dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Ordinary share equity beginning of period $ 9,613,049 $ 8,432,417 Net income (loss) attributable to XL Group plc (474,760 ) 603,550 Share buybacks (667,022 ) (521,920 ) Share issues 573,015 1,109 Ordinary share dividends (138,978 ) (134,238 ) Preferred share dividends (34,694 ) Gain on redemption of Series C preference ordinary shares 16,616 Change in accumulated other comprehensive income 482,269 1,243,262 Impact of adoption of new authoritative embedded derivative guidance, net of tax (31,917 ) Share based compensation and other 37,337 38,864 Ordinary share equity end of period $ 9,424,910 $ 9,613,049 Debt The following tables present the Companys debt under outstanding securities and lenders commitments as at December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Notes Payable and Debt (U.S. dollars in thousands) Commitment/ Debt In Use/ Outstanding Year of Expiry Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years After 5 Years 4 year revolver $ 1,000,000 $ 2015 $ $ $ $ 6.50% XLCFE Notes (1) 600,000 599,971 2012 600,000 5.25% Senior Notes 600,000 597,501 2014 600,000 5.75% Senior Notes 400,000 395,963 2021 400,000 6.375% Senior Notes 350,000 348,592 2024 350,000 6.25% Senior Notes 325,000 322,591 2027 325,000 $ 3,275,000 $ 2,264,618 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ $ 1,075,000 Adjustment to carrying value impact of fair value hedges 10,709 Carrying value $ 2,275,327 (1) The XLCFE Notes were repaid at maturity on January 15, 2012. In Use and Outstanding data represent December 31, 2011 accreted values. Payments Due by Period data represent ultimate redemption values. In addition, see Item 8, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes Payable and Debt Financing Arrangements, for further information. At December 31, 2011, banks and investors provided the Company and its subsidiaries with $3.3 billion of debt capacity, of which $2.3 billion was utilized by the Company. These facilities consist of: a revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion. 98 senior unsecured notes of approximately $2.3 billion. These notes require the Company to pay a fixed rate of interest during their terms. At December 31, 2011, there were five outstanding issues of senior unsecured notes: $600 million XLCFE Notes due January 2012, with a fixed coupon of 6.5%. These notes were repaid at maturity on January 15, 2012. The notes were issued at 99.469% and gross proceeds were $596.8 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $7.9 million. $600 million senior notes due September 2014, with a fixed coupon of 5.25%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued in two tranches of $300 million aggregate principal amount each one tranche at 99.432% and the other at 98.419%. Aggregate gross proceeds were $593.6 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $4 million. $400 million senior notes due October 2021, with a fixed coupon of 5.75%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at 100.0% and gross proceeds were $395.9 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $4.1 million. $350 million senior notes due November 2024, with a fixed coupon of 6.375%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at 100.0% and gross proceeds were $350 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $2 million. $325 million of senior notes due May 2027, with a fixed coupon of 6.25%. The security is publicly traded. The notes were issued at 99.805% and gross proceeds were $324.4 million. Related expenses of the offering amounted to $2.5 million. Preferred Shares and Non controlling Interest in Equity of Consolidated Subsidiaries Neither the Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares nor the Series E preference ordinary shares were transferred from XL Cayman to XL Ireland in the Redomestication. Accordingly, subsequent to July 1, 2010, these instruments represent non controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and have been reclassified to non controlling interest in equity of consolidated subsidiaries. See Item 8, Note 1, General to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. During the third quarter of 2011, all Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares were purchased and canceled. See Key Focuses of Management Capital Management herein. At December 31, 2011, the face value of the outstanding Series E preference ordinary shares was $999.5 million. On October 15, 2011, XL Cayman issued 350,000 non cumulative Series D Preference Ordinary Shares for $350 million of cash and liquid investments that were held in a trust account that was part of the Stoneheath facility. Holders of the Stoneheath Securities received one Series D Preference Ordinary Share in exchange for each Stoneheath Security. See Contingent Capital below. On December 5, 2011, the Company repurchased 5,000 of the outstanding Series D Preference Ordinary Shares with a liquidation preference value of $5.0 million for $3.7 million, including accrued dividends. As a result of these repurchases, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $1.3 million through Non controlling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of 2011. At December 31, 2011, the face value of the outstanding Series D Preference Ordinary Shares was $345.0 million. In August 2011, in accordance with the terms of the 10.75% Units, XL Cayman purchased and retired all of the 8.25% Senior Notes for $575 million in a remarketing. These notes comprised a part of the 10.75% Units. The proceeds from the remarketing were used to satisfy the purchase price for XL Irelands ordinary shares issued to holders of the 10.75% Units pursuant to the forward purchase contracts comprising a part of the 10.75% Units. Each forward purchase contract provided for the issuance of 1.3242 ordinary shares of XL Ireland at a price of $25 per share. The settlement of the forward purchase contracts resulted in XL Irelands issuance of an aggregate of 30,456,600 ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $575 million. As a result of the settlement of the forward purchase contracts, the 10.75% Units ceased to exist and are no longer traded on the NYSE. In August 2011, XL Cayman completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares that resulted in 2,811,000 Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation value of $25.00 being repurchased and canceled by XL Cayman for approximately $71.0 million including accrued and unpaid dividends and professional fees. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, and on the same terms as the offer, XL Cayman repurchased and canceled the remaining outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation value of $25.00 for approximately $0.9 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Therefore, no Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares were outstanding at December 31, 2011. On February 16, 2011, the Company repurchased 30,000 of the outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation preference value of $0.75 million for $0.65 million. In addition, the Company repurchased 500 of the outstanding Series E preference ordinary shares with a liquidation preference value of $0.50 million for $0.47 million. As a result of these 99 repurchases, the Company recorded a reduction in Non controlling interests of approximately $0.13 million in the first quarter of 2011. On February 12, 2010, the Company repurchased and canceled approximately 4.4 million Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation preference value of $110.8 million for approximately $94.2 million, which was a portion of its outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares. As a result, a book value gain of approximately $16.6 million to ordinary shareholders was recorded in the first quarter of 2010. On March 26, 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer for its outstanding Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares that resulted in approximately 12.7 million Redeemable Series C preference ordinary shares with a liquidation value of $317.3 million being purchased by the Company for approximately $104.7 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends, combined with professional fees totaling $0.8 million. As a result, a book value gain of approximately $211.8 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 to ordinary shareholders. In addition, see Item 8, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Share Capital, for further information. Contingent Capital At December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any contingent capital transactions. At December 31, 2010, the Company had one contingent capital transaction where the outstanding put option had not been exercised, as discussed below. On December 5, 2006, the Company and certain operating subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into a securities issuance agreement (the Securities Issuance Agreement), and certain of the Companys foreign insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries (Ceding Insurers) entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the Reinsurance Agreement), with Stoneheath. The net effect of these agreements to the Company was the creation of a contingent put option to issue $350.0 million of preference ordinary shares in the aggregate of XL Cayman. The agreements provided the Company with a Reinsurance Collateral Account in support of certain covered perils named in the Reinsurance Agreement. The covered perils included United States wind, European wind, California earthquake and terrorism worldwide. After an initial three month period, the covered perils as well as the attachment points and aggregate retention amounts could be changed by the Ceding Insurers in their sole discretion, which could have resulted in a material increase or decrease in the likelihood of payment under the Reinsurance Agreement. On each date on which a Ceding Insurer withdrew funds from the Reinsurance Collateral Account, the Company would have been required to issue and deliver to Stoneheath an amount of Series D Preference Ordinary Shares having an aggregate liquidation preference that is equal to the amount of funds so withdrawn from the Collateral Account. The Company was obligated to reimburse Stoneheath for certain fees and ordinary expenses. The initial term of the Reinsurance Agreement was for the period from the December 5, 2006 through June 30, 2007, with four annual mandatory extensions through June 30, 2011 (unless coverage is exhausted thereunder prior to such date). At the Ceding Insurers option, the Reinsurance Agreement was extended to December 31, 2011. On October 15, 2011, the Company announced that the Stoneheath facility would be terminated and, as a result, XL Cayman would issue Series D Preference Ordinary Shares. Under the terms of the Securities Issuance Agreement, XL Cayman was required upon the occurrence of certain conditions to issue and deliver to Stoneheath for distribution to the holders of the Stoneheath Securities, Series D Preference Ordinary Shares having an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the remaining assets in the Reinsurance Collateral Account in exchange for a distribution of such assets from the Reinsurance Collateral Account to XL Cayman. One such condition, the termination of an asset swap agreement covering the assets held under the Reinsurance Collateral Account, occurred in accordance with the terms of the swap agreement because Stoneheath did not seek to extend or replace it prior to its termination date. As a result, on November 16, 2011, Stoneheath redeemed the Stoneheath Securities and distributed the Series D Preference Ordinary Shares it received from XL Cayman in exchange for the $350 million in assets from the Reinsurance Collateral Account. Letter of Credit Facilities and other sources of collateral At December 31, 2011, the Company had five letter of credit facilities in place with total availability of $4.0 billion, of which $1.9 billion was utilized.

(3) The Company has the option to increase the size of the facilities under the December 2011 Credit Agreements by an additional $500 million across both such facilities. In 2011, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (i) entered into three new credit agreements, which provided for an aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit and revolving credit loans up to $3 billion, subject to certain options to increase the size of the facilities, and (ii) terminated the five year credit agreement dated June 21, 2007 (the 2007 Credit Agreement), which had provided for an aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit and revolving credit loans up to $4 billion. On March 25, 2011, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a secured credit agreement (the March 2011 Credit Agreement) that currently provides for issuance of letters of credit up to $1 billion with the option to increase the size of the facility by an additional $500 million. Concurrent with the effectiveness of the 2011 Credit Agreement, the commitments of the lenders under the 2007 Credit Agreement were reduced from $4 billion to $3 billion. The commitments under the March 2011 Credit Agreement will expire on, and the credit facility is available on a continuous basis until, the earlier of (i) March 25, 2014 and (ii) the date of termination in whole of the commitments upon an optional termination or reduction of the commitments by the account parties or upon an event of default. On December 9, 2011, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into (i) a new secured credit agreement (the December 2011 Secured Credit Agreement) and (ii) a new unsecured credit agreement (the December 2011 Unsecured Credit Agreement and together with the December 2011 Secured Credit Agreement, the December 2011 Credit Agreements). In connection with the December 2011 Credit Agreements, the 2007 Credit Agreement was terminated. The March 2011 Credit Agreement continues in force, but was amended to conform certain of its terms to those of the December 2011 Secured Credit Agreement. The 2007 Credit Agreement had provided for letters of credit and for revolving credit loans of up to $750 million with the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit and revolving credit loans thereunder not to exceed $3 billion. At the time at which it was terminated and the December 2011 Credit Agreements became effective, there were no outstanding revolving credit loans under the 2007 Credit Agreement. A portion of the letters of credit outstanding under the 2007 Credit Agreement at the time of its termination were continued under the March 2011 Credit Agreement and the remainder were continued under the December 2011 Credit Agreements. The December 2011 Secured Credit Agreement provides for issuance of letters of credit up to $650 million. The December 2011 Unsecured Credit Agreement is a $1.35 billion facility that provides for issuance of letters of credit and up to $1 billion of revolving credit loans. The Company has the option to increase the maximum amount of letters of credit available by an additional $500 million across the facilities under the December 2011 Credit Agreements. The commitments under each December 2011 Credit Agreement expire on, and such credit facilities are available until, the earlier of (i) December 9, 2015 and (ii) the date of termination in whole of the commitments upon an optional termination or reduction of the commitments by the account parties or upon an event of default. The availability of letters of credit under the December 2011 Secured Credit Agreement and the March 2011 Credit Agreements is subject to a borrowing base requirement, determined on the basis of specified percentages of the face value of eligible categories of assets varying by type of collateral. In the event that such credit support is insufficient, the Company could be required to provide alternative security to cedants. This could take the form of insurance trusts supported by the Companys investment portfolio or funds withheld (amounts retained by ceding companies to collateralize loss or premium reserves) using the Companys cash resources or combinations thereof. The face amount of letters of credit required is driven by, among other things, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business written by the Company and the loss experience of such business. In addition to letters of credit, the Company has established insurance trusts in the United States that provide cedants with statutory credit for reinsurance under state insurance regulation in the United States. The Company reviews current and projected collateral requirements on a regular basis, as well as new sources of collateral. Managements objective is to maintain an excess amount of collateral sources over expected uses. The Company also reviews its liquidity needs on a regular basis. In October 2011, the $75,000 letter of credit facility that was supporting a subsidiary of the Company terminated. On June 22, 2010, a $2.3 billion five year letter of credit facility expired and was not replaced. 101 Covenants The Companys Credit Facilities contains a number of financial covenants that must be met and maintained, and that among other things, could restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our financial flexibility including the ability to: engage in mergers or consolidations; dispose of assets outside of the ordinary course of business; create liens on assets; and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The following outlines the covenant requirements and actual amounts as of December 31, 2011: Covenant Requirement Actual Ratio or Balance at December 31,2011 Margin of Adverse Development from December 31, 2011 Levels Ratio of Total Funded Debt to Total Capitalization (1) Less than 0.35:1.00 0:18:1.00 $2.1 billion Maximum Secured Indebtedness (2) Less than 15% of consolidated net worth $345 million $1.2 billion Consolidated Net Worth (3) $6.5 billion $10.3 billion $3.8 billion Financial Strength Ratings (4) A or better from A.M. Best A(Stable) Two notches (1) The ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization not to be greater than 0.35:1.00. This ratio is defined as total funded debt to the sum of total funded debt plus consolidated net worth. (2) Secured indebtedness excludes secured letter of credit facilities as permitted under the schedules to the credit facilities. At December 31, 2011, such secured letter of credit facilities amounted to $1.75 billion. (3) Consolidated net worth means, at any time, the consolidated stockholders equity of the Company excluding (a) the effect of any adjustments required under the authoritative accounting guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities; and (b) any exempt indebtedness (and the assets relating thereto) in the event such exempt indebtedness is consolidated on the consolidated balance sheet the Company. (4) Covenants require that none of XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd, XL Re Ltd or XL Re Europe Ltd has a financial strength ratings of less than A from A.M. Best. At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. As noted in the table above, at December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants by significant margins, and the Company currently remains in compliance. CROSS DEFAULT AND OTHER PROVISIONS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS The following describes certain terms of the documents referred to below. All documents referred to below have been filed with the SEC and should be referred to for an assessment of the complete contractual obligations of the Company. In general, all of the Companys bank facilities, indentures and other documents relating to the Companys outstanding indebtedness, including the credit facilities discussed above (collectively, the Companys Debt Documents), contain cross default provisions to each other and the Companys Debt Documents contain affirmative covenants. These covenants provide for, among other things, minimum required ratings of the Companys insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries and minimum required levels of secured indebtedness in the future. In addition, generally each of the Companys Debt Documents provide for an event of default in the event of a change of control of the Company or certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. A downgrade below A of the Companys principal insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries by either S&P or A.M. Best, which is two notches below the current S&P financial strength rating of A (Stable) and the A.M. Best financial strength rating of A (Stable) of these subsidiaries, may trigger cancelation provisions in a significant amount of the Companys assumed reinsurance agreements and may potentially require the Company to return unearned premiums to cedants. In addition, due to collateral posting requirements under the Companys letter of credit and revolving credit facilities, such a downgrade may require the posting of cash collateral in support of certain in use portions of these facilities (see Liquidity and Capital Resources). In certain limited instances, such downgrades may require the Company to return cash or assets to counterparties or to settle derivative and or other transactions with the respective counterparties. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and or liquidity. 102 Under the March 2011 Credit Agreement and December 2011 Credit Agreements, in the event that XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd, XL Re Ltd or XL Re Europe Ltd fail to maintain a financial strength rating of at least A from A.M. Best, an event of default would occur. Given that all of the Companys Debt Documents contain cross default provisions, this may result in all holders declaring such debt due and payable and an acceleration of all debt due under those documents. If this were to occur, the Company may not have funds sufficient at that time to repay any or all of such indebtedness. LONG TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table presents the Companys long term contractual obligations and related payments as at December 31, 2011, due by period. This table excludes further commitments of $135.2 million to the Companys related investment funds and certain limited partnerships, and letter of credit facilities of $1.9 billion. See Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments, and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies. See Item 8, Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes Payable and Debt and Financing Arrangements, for further information. Contractual Obligations (U.S. dollars in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years Long term debt obligations $ 2,275,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ $ 1,075,000 Interest on long term debt 944,910 100,294 263,453 198,607 382,556 Operating lease obligations 180,936 34,867 56,877 33,413 55,779 Capital lease obligations 224,645 11,169 23,183 24,356 165,937 Deposit liabilities (1) 2,419,629 165,270 245,552 314,663 1,694,144 Future policy benefits (2) 7,806,322 387,336 754,256 743,967 5,920,763 Unpaid losses and loss expenses property and casualty operations (3) 20,960,825 4,810,155 5,775,328 3,401,607 6,973,735 Total $ 34,812,267 $ 6,109,091 $ 7,718,649 $ 4,716,613 $ 16,267,914 (1) Deposit liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011 were $1,608,108. The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on payments due in the future. The payment related to these liabilities varies primarily based on interest rates. The ultimate payments associated with these liabilities could differ from the Companys estimate. See Item 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Deposit Liabilities, for further information. (2) Future policy benefit reserves related to Life operations were $4,845,394 on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011. Amounts reflected above include an allowance for future premiums in respect of contracts under which premiums are payable throughout the life of the underlying policy. The value of the discount is also included for those lines of business that have reserves where future claim payments and future premium receipts can be estimated using actuarial principles. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments and premium receipts related to these reserves vary based on the underlying experience of the portfolio. Typical elements of the experience include mortality, morbidity and persistency. The ultimate amount of the claims payments and premium receipts could differ materially from the Companys estimated amounts. (3) The unpaid loss and loss expenses were $20,613,901 on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011. The difference from the amount included above relates to the discount on payments due in the future for certain workers compensation lines. The timing and amounts of actual claims payments related to these P&C reserves vary based on many factors including large individual losses, changes in the legal environment, as well as general market conditions. The ultimate amount of the claims payments could differ materially from the Companys estimated amounts. For information regarding the estimates for unpaid loss and loss expenses as well as factors effecting potential payment patterns of reserves for actual and potential claims related the Companys different lines of business see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Certain lines of business written by the Company, such as excess casualty, have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity. This may result in significant variability in loss payment patterns and, therefore, may impact the related asset/liability investment management process. In order to be in a position, if necessary, to make these payments, the Companys liquidity requirements are supported by having revolving lines of credit facilities available to the Company and significant reinsurance programs, in addition to the Companys general high grade fixed income investment portfolio. 103 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) AND OTHER OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At times, the Company has utilized VIEs both indirectly and directly in the ordinary course of the Companys business. The Company invests in CDOs, and other investment vehicles that are issued through variable interest entities as part of the Companys investment portfolio. The activities of these VIEs are generally limited to holding the underlying collateral used to service investments therein. Our involvement in these entities is passive in nature and we are not the arranger of these entities. The Company has not been involved in establishing these entities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities as contemplated in current authoritative accounting guidance. The Company has a limited number of remaining outstanding credit enhancement exposures including written financial guarantee and credit default swap contracts. The obligations related to these transactions are often securitized through variable interest entities. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities as contemplated in current authoritative accounting guidance. For further details on the nature of the obligations and the size of the Companys maximum exposure see Item 8, Note 14, Derivative Instruments, and Note 17(h), Commitments and Contingencies Financial and Other Guarantee Exposures, and to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has utilized variable interest entities in certain instances as a means of accessing contingent capital. The Company has utilized unconsolidated entities in the formation of contingent capital facilities. At December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any contingent capital facilities. The following description is of the contingent capital facility that was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2011. On December 5, 2006, the Company and ceding insurers entered into a securities issuance agreement, and certain of the Companys ceding insurers entered into a reinsurance agreement, with Stoneheath. The net effect of these agreements to the Company was the creation of a contingent put option in the amount of $350.0 million in the aggregate. The Companys interests in Stoneheath represented an interest in a variable interest entity under current authoritative accounting guidance, however, the Company was not the primary beneficiary as contemplated in that guidance. The agreements provided the Company with a Reinsurance Collateral Account in support of certain covered perils named in the Reinsurance Agreement. The covered perils include U.S. wind, European wind, California earthquake and terrorism worldwide. The contingent put option was recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included herein or elsewhere. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by the federal securities laws. 105 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and value at risk (VaR) analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of the Companys investment portfolio. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial and other instruments. The Company is principally exposed to the following market risks: interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, equity price risk, and credit risk. For a discussion of related risks, see the risk factor titled We are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign exchange rates as well as other investment risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in Item 1A, Risk Factors, above. The majority of the Companys market risk arises from its investment portfolio which consists of fixed income securities, alternative investments, public equities, private investments, derivatives, other investments, and cash, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and other related market risks. The Companys fixed income and equity securities are primarily classified as available for sale; accordingly market related changes will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income. Nevertheless, market related changes affect consolidated net income when, and if, a security is sold or is impaired. On a limited basis the Company may enter into derivatives and other financial instruments primarily for risk management purposes. For example, the Company may use derivatives to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk related to its consolidated net exposures. From time to time, the Company may also use instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk of interest rate changes, credit deterioration, foreign currency exposures, and other market related exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. Historically, the Company entered into credit derivatives outside of the investment portfolio in conjunction with the legacy financial guarantee and financial products operations. The Company attempts to manage the risks associated with derivative use with guidelines established by senior management. Derivative instruments are carried at fair value with the resulting changes in fair value recognized in income in the period in which they occur. See Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments, for further information. This risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity and VaR analyses presented in this document are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to, among other things, actual developments in the global financial markets and changes in the composition of the Companys investment portfolio. The results of analysis used by the Company to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses. See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates. The Companys fixed income portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk. The Companys liabilities are accrued at a static rate from an accounting standpoint. However, management considers the liabilities to have an economic exposure to interest rate risk and manages the net economic exposure to interest rate risk considering both assets and liabilities. Interest rate risk is managed within the context of its SAA process by specifying SAA Benchmarks relative to the estimated duration of its liabilities and managing the fixed income portfolio relative to the Benchmarks such that the overall economic effect of interest rate risk is within managements risk tolerance. Nevertheless, the Company remains exposed to interest rate risk with respect to the Companys overall net asset position and more generally from an accounting standpoint since the assets are marked to market, while liabilities are accrued at a static rate. In addition, while the Companys debt is not carried at fair value and not adjusted for market changes, changes in market interest rates could have an impact on debt values at the time of any refinancing. 106 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Many of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies, therefore, foreign exchange risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses in the Companys Statement of Income arise for accounting purposes when net assets or liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the functional currency of those subsidiaries. While unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on underwriting balances are reported in earnings, the offsetting unrealized gains and losses on invested assets are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity, to the extent that the asset currency does not match that entitys functional currency. This results in an accounting mismatch that will result in foreign exchange gains or losses in the consolidated statements of income depending on the movement in certain currencies. The Company has formed several branches with Euro and U.K. sterling functional currencies and continues to focus on attempting to limit exposure to foreign exchange risk. Foreign currency exchange rate risk in general is reviewed as part of the Companys risk management framework. Within its asset liability framework for the investment portfolio, the Company pursues a general policy of holding the assets and liabilities in the same currency and as such the Company is not generally exposed to the risks associated with foreign exchange movements within its investment portfolio as currency impacts on the assets are generally matched by corresponding impacts on the related liabilities. However, locally required capital levels are invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations and are not matched by related liabilities. Foreign exchange contracts within the investment portfolio may be utilized to manage individual portfolio foreign exchange exposures, subject to investment management service providers guidelines established by management. These contracts are generally not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purposes and, therefore, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur. These contracts generally have maturities of three months or less. The Company may also attempt to manage the foreign exchange volatility arising on certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These include, but are not limited to, premium receivable, reinsurance contracts, claims payable and investments in subsidiaries. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for the Company are the U.K. sterling, the Euro, the Swiss franc and the Canadian dollar. The following table provides more information on the Companys net exposures to its principal foreign currencies at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010: (Foreign Currency in Millions) 2011 2010 Euro 52.0 90.3 U.K. Sterling 35.1 2.1 Swiss Franc 153.7 268.4 Canadian Dollar 222.5 247.8 Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligors continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument or contract. The Company is exposed to direct credit risk within its investment portfolio as well as through general counterparties, including customers and reinsurers. The Company manages credit risk within its investment portfolio through its Strategic Asset Allocation framework and its established investment credit policies, which address quality of obligors and counterparties, industry limits, and diversification requirements. The Companys exposure to market credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. Certain of the Companys underwriting activities expose it to indirect credit risk in that profitability of certain strategies can correlate with credit events at the issuer level, industry level or country level. The Company manages these risks through established underwriting policies which operate in accordance with established limit and escalation frameworks. The Company has an established credit risk governance process delegated to the Credit Sub Committee of the Enterprise Risk Management Committee. The governance process is designed to ensure that transactions and activities, individually and in the aggregate, are carried out within managements risk tolerances. Credit Risk Investment Portfolio Credit risk in the investment portfolio is the exposure to adverse changes in the creditworthiness of individual investment holdings, issuers, groups of issuers, industries and countries. A widening of credit spreads will increase the net unrealized loss position, will increase losses associated with credit based non qualifying derivatives where the Company assumes credit exposure, and, if issuer credit spreads increase significantly for an extended period of time and in a period of increasing defaults, would also likely result in higher other than temporary impairments. All else held equal, credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of the Companys securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or 107 financial condition. The credit spread duration in the Companys fixed income portfolio, excluding the impact of the HTM election, was 3.7 years at December 31, 2011. The Company manages credit risk in the investment portfolio, including fixed income, alternative and short term investment through the credit research performed primarily by the investment management service providers. The management of credit risk in the investment portfolio is also fully integrated in the Companys credit risk management governance framework and the management of credit exposures and concentrations within the investment portfolio are carried out in accordance with the Companys risk policies, philosophies, appetites, limits and risk concentrations delegated to the investment portfolio. In the investment portfolio, the Company reviews on a regular basis its asset concentration, credit quality and adherence to the Companys credit limit guidelines. Any issuer over its credit limits, experiencing financial difficulties, material credit quality deterioration or potentially subject to forthcoming credit quality deterioration is placed on a watch list for closer monitoring. Where appropriate, exposures are reduced or prevented from increasing. The table below shows the Companys aggregate fixed income portfolio by credit rating in percentage terms of the Companys aggregate fixed income exposure (including fixed maturities, short term investments, cash and cash equivalents and net payable for investments purchased) as at December 31, 2011: Percentage of Aggregate Fixed Income Portfolio (1) (2) AAA 51.1 % AA 16.6 % A 22.3 % BBB 7.6 % BB & below 2.3 % Not rated 0.1 % Total (1) 100.0 % (1) Included in the above are $266.0 million or 0.8% of the portfolio that represents medium term notes rated at the average credit rating of the underlying asset pools backing the notes. (2) The credit rating for each asset reflected above was principally determined based on the weighted average rating of the individual securities from Standard & Poors, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. U.S. agencies paper, whether with implicit or explicit government support, reflect the credit quality rating of the U.S. government for the purpose of these calculations. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the average credit quality of the Companys aggregate fixed income investment portfolio was Aa2/AA, excluding operating cash. The Companys $10.7 billion portfolio of government and government related, agency, sovereign and cash holdings were rated AAA at December 31, 2011. The Companys $11.8 billion portfolio of corporates is rated A. The Companys $9.0 billion structured credit portfolio is AA+ rated. The Company is closely monitoring its corporate financial bond holdings given the events of the past four years. The table below summarizes the Companys significant exposures (defined as bonds issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost in excess of $50.0 million) to corporate bonds of financial issuers held within its available for sale and HTM investment portfolio at December 31, 2011, representing both amortized cost and net unrealized gains (losses): 108 (U.S. dollars in millions) Issuer (by Global Ultimate Parent) Weighted Average Credit Quality (1) Amortized Cost December 31, 2011 (2) Unrealized Gain/ (Loss) December 31, 2011 Rabobank Nederland NV AA+ $ 169.8 $ (2.3 ) The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(2) Government guaranteed paper has been excluded from the above figures. Included within all financial bond exposures are covered bonds with a fair value of $368.7 million and amortized cost of $360.2 million. Within the Companys corporate financial bond holdings, the Company is further monitoring its exposures to hybrid securities, representing Tier One and Upper Tier Two securities of various financial institutions. The following table summarizes the top ten exposures to hybrid securities, listed by amortized cost representing both amortized cost and unrealized (losses): (U.S. dollars in millions) Issuer (by Global Ultimate Parent) Tier One Amortized Cost at December 31, 2011 Upper Tier Two Amortized Cost at December 31, 2011 Total Amortized Costat December 31,2011 Net Unrealized (Loss) at December 31, 2011 Barclays, Plc $ $ 50.6 $ 50.6 $ (13.2 ) Zurich Financial Services. 25.6 25.6 (4.7 ) Aviva PLC 5.4 19.7 25.1 (8.4 ) Nationwide Building Society 24.6 24.6 (8.5 ) Legal & General Group PLC 24.6 24.6 (5.7 ) Standard Life PLC 21.3 21.3 (5.0 ) RSA Insurance Group PLC 20.5 20.5 (3.2 ) Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. 20.5 20.5 (1.1 ) The British United Provident Association Limited 20.1 20.1 (5.7 ) Danske Bank A/S 8.9 11.1 20.0 (3.2 ) Total $ 59.4 $ 193.5 $ 252.9 $ (58.7 ) 109 At December 31, 2011, the top 10 corporate holdings, which exclude government guaranteed and government sponsored enterprises, represented approximately 5.0% of the aggregate fixed income portfolio and approximately 13.2% of all corporate holdings. The top 10 corporate bond holdings listed below represent the direct exposure to the corporations listed below, including their subsidiaries, and excludes any securitized, credit enhanced and collateralized asset or mortgage backed securities, cash and cash equivalents, pooled notes and any over the counter (OTC) derivative counterparty exposures, if applicable but does include covered bonds.

Within the Companys fixed income portfolios, the Company is further monitoring its exposures to holdings representing risk in certain Euro zone countries (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain). In particular, the Company has government holdings of $27.0 million, corporate holdings of $225.5 million (financials $20.8 million, non financials $204.7 million) and structured credit holdings totaling $3.2 million in GIIPS. The non financial corporate holdings primarily consist of securities issued by multinational companies with low reliance on local economics and systemically important industries such as utilities and telecoms. For further detail on the Companys exposure to the Euro zone sovereign debt crisis please refer to Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Balance Sheet Analysis. 110 The Company also has exposure to credit risk associated with its mortgage backed and asset backed securities. The table below shows the breakdown of the $9.0 billion structured credit portfolio, of which 78.2% is AAA rated: (U.S. dollars in millions) Fair Value Percentage of Structured Portfolio CMBS $ 974.8 10.8 % Non Agency RMBS 722.8 8.0 % Core CDO (non ABS CDOs and CLOs) 662.9 7.4 % Other ABS 1,266.8 14.1 % Agency RMBS 5,381.3 59.7 % Total $ 9,008.6 100.0 % Credit Risk Other Credit derivatives are purchased within the Companys investment portfolio, have been sold through a limited number of contracts written as part of the Companys previous financial lines business, and were previously entered into through the Companys prior reinsurance agreements with Syncora. From time to time, the Company may purchase credit default swaps to hedge an existing position or concentration of holdings. The credit derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments, for further information. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, alternatives and other investment funds and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the Companys counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be sold or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure that is due. The Company also has exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions, revolving credit facility and letter of credit commitments and equity investments. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations. With regards to unpaid losses and loss expenses recoverable and reinsurance balances receivable, the Company has credit risk should any of its reinsurers be unable or unwilling to settle amounts due to the Company; however, these exposures are not marked to market. For further information relating to reinsurer credit risk, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses Recoverable and Reinsurance Balances Receivable. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the other parties to its derivative instruments in general; however, the Company does not anticipate non performance. The difference between the notional principal amounts and the associated market value is the Companys maximum credit exposure. Equity Price Risk Equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the market value of equities. The Companys equity investment portfolio is exposed to equity price risk. At December 31, 2011, the Companys equity portfolio was approximately $376.6 million as compared to $84.8 million at December 31, 2010. This excludes fixed income fund investments of $91.6 million that generally do not have the risk characteristics of equity investments but are treated as equity investments under GAAP. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Companys direct allocation to equity securities was 1.1% and a negligible percentage, respectively, of the total investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net payable for investments purchased). The Company also estimates the equity risk embedded in certain alternative and private investments. Such estimates are derived from market exposures provided to the Company by certain individual fund investments and or internal statistical analyses. 111 Other Market Risks The Companys private investment portfolio is invested in limited partnerships and other entities which are not publicly traded. In addition to normal market risks, these positions may also be exposed to liquidity risk, risks related to distressed investments, and risks specific to startup or small companies. As at December 31, 2011, the Companys exposure to private investments, excluding unfunded commitments, was $288.4 million representing 0.9% of the fixed income portfolio compared to $331.7 million as at December 31, 2010. The Companys alternative investment portfolio, which is exposed to equity and credit risk as well as certain other market risks, had a total exposure of $1,027.2 million, representing approximately 3.1% of the investment portfolio (including cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income and net payable for investments purchased) at December 31, 2011, as compared to December 31, 2010, where the Company had a total exposure of $933.5 million representing approximately 2.8% of the investment portfolio. At December 31, 2011, bond and stock index futures outstanding had a net long position of $12.6 million as compared to a net long position of $14.1 million at December 31, 2010. The Company may reduce its exposure to these futures through offsetting transactions, including options and forwards. As noted above, the Company also invests in certain derivative positions that can be impacted by market value movements. For further details on derivative instruments see Item 8, Note 14, Derivative Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity and Value at Risk Analysis Value at Risk (VaR) is central to the Companys market risk management framework for its investment portfolio. VaR is a statistical risk measure representing a specific percentile of estimated potential mark to market portfolio returns in normal market conditions over a specific time horizon. The Company estimates the VaR of the investment portfolio, the P&C investment portfolio and the Life investment portfolio, using a one year holding period and a 95% level of confidence. This means that, on average, the Company could expect mark to market losses greater than predicted by the VaR results 5% of the time, or once every 20 years. The calculation of VaR is performed monthly using an analytical, or variance covariance approach, based on the linear sensitivity of the investment portfolio and individual securities to a broad set of systematic market risk factors and idiosyncratic risk factors. The Company estimates the parametric sensitivity of every security in the investment portfolio to changes in key interest rates, spreads, implied volatility and equities. The parametric exposures are summed using the appropriate investment portfolio weights to compute the investment portfolios exposure to these systematic and idiosyncratic market risk factors. The modeling of risk, as measured by VaR, involves a number of assumptions and approximations. While the Company believes that its assumptions and approximations are appropriate, there is no uniform industry methodology for calculating VaR. The Company notes that different VaR results can be produced for the same portfolio dependent not only on the approach used but also on the assumptions employed when implementing the approach. The VaR approach uses historical data to determine the sensitivity of each of the underlying securities to the risk factors incorporated into the pricing models employed in the VaR estimates. In calculating these sensitivities, greater importance is placed on the more recent data points and information. Since the VaR approach is based on historical positions and market data, VaR results should not be viewed as an absolute and predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for the Company to predict risk. There is no assurance that the Companys actual future losses will not exceed its VaR and the Company expects that 5% of the time the VaR will be exceeded. Additionally, the Company acknowledges the fact that risks associated with abnormal market events can be significantly different from the VaR results and these are by definition not reflected or assessed in the VaR analysis, rather this is evaluated using the Companys stress testing framework. The table below summarizes the Companys assessment of the estimated impact on the value of the Companys investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 associated with an immediate and hypothetical: +100bps increase in interest rates, a 10% decline in equity markets, a +100bps widening in spreads and a +10% widening in spreads. The table also reports the 95%, 1 year VaRs for the Companys investment portfolios at December 31, 2011, excluding foreign exchange. The interest rate, spread risk, and VaR referenced in the table below include the impact of market movements on the Companys held to maturity fixed maturities from the Companys Life investment portfolios. While the market value of these holdings is sensitive to prevailing interest rates and credit spreads, the Companys book value is not impacted as these holdings are carried at amortized cost. At December 31, 2011, if the Company were to exclude these impacts in order to present the impact of these risks to the Companys book value, the interest rate risk would be reduced by approximately $302.4 million, absolute spread risk would be 112 reduced by approximately $202.1 million, relative spread risk would be reduced by approximately $31.7 million, and VaR would be reduced by approximately $327.1 million. The table below excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate risk on the Companys investment portfolio. The Companys investment portfolio is managed on an asset liability matched basis, and, accordingly, any foreign exchange movements impact the assets and liabilities equally. See foreign exchange rate risk for further details. The Company considers that the investment portfolio VaR estimated results as well as the P&C and Life investment portfolios VaR estimated results excluding foreign exchange rate risk are the more relevant and appropriate metrics to consider when assessing the actual risk of the investment portfolio. The estimated results below also do not include any risk contributions from our various operating affiliates (strategic, investment manager or financial operating affiliates) or certain other investments that are carried at amortized cost.

(2) The estimated impact on the fair value of the Companys investment portfolio of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in the value of equity exposures in the Companys equity portfolio, certain equity sensitive alternative investments and private equity investments. This includes the Companys estimate of equity risk embedded in the alternatives and private investment portfolio with such estimates utilizing market exposures provided to the Company by certain individual fund investments, internal statistical analyses, and or various assumptions regarding illiquidity and concentrations. (3) The estimated impact on the fair value of the Companys fixed income portfolio of an immediate hypothetical +100 basis point increase in all global government related corporate and structured credit spreads to which the Companys fixed income portfolio is exposed. This excludes exposure to credit spreads in the Companys alternative investments, private investments and counterparty exposure. (4) The estimated impact on the fair value of the Companys fixed income portfolio of an immediate hypothetical +10% increase in all global government related corporate and structured credit spreads to which the Companys fixed income portfolio is exposed. This excludes exposure to credit spreads in the Companys alternative investments, private investments and counterparty exposure. (5) The VaR results are based on a 95% confidence interval, with a one year holding period, excluding foreign exchange rate risk. The Companys investment portfolio VaR at December 31, 2011 is not necessarily indicative of future VaR levels. (6) The VaR results are the standalone VaRs, based on the prescribed methodology, for each component of the Companys Total Investment Portfolio. The standalone VaRs of the individual components are non additive, with the difference between the summation of the individual component VaRs and their respective aggregations being due to diversification benefits across the individual components. In the case of the VaR results for the Companys Total Investment Portfolio, the results also include the impact associated with the Companys Business and Other Investments. (7) The Companys Total Investment Portfolio comprises the Companys P&C Investment Portfolio and Life Investment Portfolio as well as the Companys Business and Other Investments that do not form part of the Companys P&C Investment Portfolio or Life Investment Portfolio. The individual results reported in the above table for the Companys Total Investment Portfolio therefore represent the aggregate impact on the Companys P&C Investment Portfolio, Life Investment Portfolio and the majority of the Companys Other Investments. 113 Stress Testing VaR does not provide the means to estimate the magnitude of the loss in the 5% of occurrences when the Company expects the VaR level to be exceeded. To complement the VaR analysis based on normal market environments, the Company considers the impact on the investment portfolio in several different stress scenarios to analyze the effect of unusual market conditions. The Company establishes certain stress scenarios which are applied to the actual investment portfolio. As these stress scenarios and estimated gains and losses are based on scenarios established by the Company, they will not necessarily reflect future stress events or gains and losses from such events. The results of the stress scenarios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they are appropriate, based on current shareholders equity, market conditions and the Companys total risk tolerance. It is important to note that when assessing the risk of the Companys investment portfolio, the Company does not take into account either the value or risk associated with the liabilities arising from the Companys operations.
