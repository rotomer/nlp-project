Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and cyclical market patterns which contribute to create factors that may affect our future operating results including: Market Demand increased dependence on turns orders (orders received and shipped within the same fiscal quarter); limited visibility of demand for products, especially new products; reduced capital spending by our customers; weaker demand for our products or those of our customers due to a prolonged period of economic uncertainty; excess inventory at Xilinx and within the supply chain including overbuilding of OEM products; additional excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding write downs due to a significant deterioration in demand; inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely manner; inability to obtain manufacturing or test and assembly capacity in sufficient volume; inability to predict the success of our customers products in their markets; an unexpected increase in demand resulting in longer lead times that causes delays in customer production schedules; dependence on the health of the end markets and customers we serve; Competitive Environment price and product competition, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation; major customers converting to ASIC or ASSP designs from Xilinx PLDs; faster than normal erosion of average selling prices; timely introduction of new products and ability to manufacture in sufficient quantities at introduction; Technology lower gross margins due to product mix shifts and reduced manufacturing efficiency; failure to retain or attract specialized technical/management personnel; timely introduction of advanced manufacturing technologies; ability to safeguard the Companys products from competitors by means of patents and other intellectual property protections; impact of new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep declines in demand for others; ability to successfully manage multiple foundry relationships; 12 Other changes in accounting pronouncements; dependence on distributors to generate sales and process customer orders; disruption in sales generation, order processing and logistics if a distributor materially defaults on a contract; impact of changes to current export/import laws and regulations; volatility of the securities market, particularly as it relates to the technology sector and our investment in UMC; unexpected product quality issues; global events impacting the world economy or specific regions of the world; increase in the cost of natural resources; parts shortages at our suppliers; failure of information systems impacting financial reporting; catastrophes that impact the ability of our supply chain to operate or deliver product; and higher costs associated with multiple foundry relationships. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results, including those described in this report, are much less reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older, more stable and mature industries. Based on the factors noted herein, we may experience substantial fluctuations in future operating results. Our results of operations are impacted by global economic and political conditions, dependence on new products, dependence on independent manufacturers and subcontractors, competition, intellectual property, potential new accounting pronouncements, Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 compliance and litigation, each of which is discussed in greater detail below. Potential Effect of Global Economic and Political Conditions Sales and operations outside of the United States subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. For example, we have sales and operations in the Asia Pacific region, Japan and Europe. Past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues, and such conditions may occur in the future. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movement of the Euro and Yen against the U.S. dollar had no material impact to our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency instability may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers ability to repay existing obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our foreign currency denominated costs, assets and liabilities. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. Our financial condition and results of operations are increasingly dependent on the global economy. Any instability in worldwide economic environments occasioned for example, by political instability or terrorist activity could impact economic activity and could lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers. Additional risks to us include U.S. military actions, changes in U.S. government spending on military and defense activities impacting defense associated sales, economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, government regulation of exports, imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and generally longer receivable collection periods. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers, end customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. 13 Dependence on New Products Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including: timely completion of new product designs; ability to generate new design opportunities (design wins); availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products; ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies to circuit geometries on 65 nanometers and smaller; achieving acceptable yields; ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly subcontractors; ability to obtain advanced packaging; availability of supporting software design tools; utilization of predefined IP cores of logic; industry acceptance; and successful deployment of electronic systems by our customers. Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Dependence on Independent Manufacturers and Subcontractors During fiscal 2006, nearly all of our wafers were manufactured in Taiwan by UMC and in Japan by Toshiba and Seiko. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer foundries, which usually result in short term agreements. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC, which supplies the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, which include transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, producing wafers at acceptable yields, and delivering them in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies. In addition, greater demand for wafers produced by the foundries without an offsetting increase in foundry capacity, raises the likelihood of potential wafer price increases. UMCs foundries in Taiwan and Toshibas and Seikos foundries in Japan as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past. Should there be a major earthquake in our suppliers or our operating locations in the future, our operations, including our manufacturing activities, may be disrupted. This type of disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely manner, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason, including other natural disasters such as fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 14 We are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services. Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, unavailability of or disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand reducing net sales and negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Competition Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors, Altera Corporation (Altera) and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs, and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic industry include: product pricing; time to market; product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density; field upgradability; adaptability of products to specific applications; ease of use and functionality of software design tools; functionality of predefined IP cores of logic; inventory management; access to leading edge process technology; and ability to provide timely customer service and support. Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high volume, low cost and low power applications as well as high performance, high density applications. In addition, we anticipate continued price reductions proportionate with our ability to lower the cost for established products. However, we may not be successful in achieving these strategies. Other competitors include manufacturers of: high density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA type architectures; high volume and low cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; high speed, low density CPLDs; high performance DSP devices; products with embedded processors; products with embedded multi gigabit transceivers; and other new or emerging programmable logic products. Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to enter the PLD segment. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to the market segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in the PLD market segment. We could also face competition from our licensees. We have granted limited rights to other companies with respect to certain of our older technology which may enable them to manufacture and market products which may be competitive with some of our older products. 15 In conjunction with Xilinxs settlement of the patent litigation with Altera in July 2001, both companies entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement for many of each companys patents through July 2006. Intellectual Property We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future; assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation and we may not prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Potential Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements There may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings, which may have an impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment." (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) eliminates our ability to account for share based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," (APB 25) and will instead require companies to recognize compensation expense, using a fair value based method, for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans. The Company will implement the standard for the fiscal year beginning April 2, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a material impact on our results of operations. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about recent accounting pronouncements. Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 Compliance We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, our internal control effectiveness may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. Litigation We are currently involved in several legal matters. See Item 3. "Legal Proceedings." ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices, which include the administrative, sales, customer support, marketing, research and development and manufacturing and testing groups, are located in San Jose, California. This main site consists of adjacent buildings providing 588,000 square feet of space, which we own. In February 2000, we purchased 87 acres of land in South San Jose near our corporate facility. At present, we do not have any 16 plans for development of this land. Effective in January 2006, we began leasing a 106,000 square foot office facility in San Jose due to space constraints in our main facility. In addition, we own a 228,000 square foot facility in the metropolitan area of Dublin, Ireland which serves as our regional headquarters in Europe. The Irish facility is primarily used for manufacturing and testing of our products, support for our customers and sales offices in Europe, research and development, and information technology (IT) support. In April 2004, we entered into a sublease on a 15,000 square foot facility in Singapore, which serves as our Asia Pacific regional headquarters. Subsequent to this sublease, in late 2004 and in 2005, we subleased an additional 15,000 square feet of office space and test floor area in the same facility. The Singapore facility is primarily used for manufacturing and testing of our products, support for our customers and sales offices in Asia Pacific/Japan, and coordination and management of certain third parties in our supply chain. In early November 2005, Xilinx announced a $40.0 million investment in a new building in Singapore. Construction commenced on schedule in late November 2005 and the project is expected to be completed in June 2007. Once completed, the new building is expected to have 222,000 square feet of available space. We also own a 130,000 square foot facility in Longmont, Colorado. The Longmont facility serves as the primary location for our software efforts in the areas of research and development, manufacturing and quality control. In addition, we also own a 200,000 square foot facility and 40 acres of land adjacent to the Longmont facility for future expansion. The facility is being partially leased to tenants under short term lease agreements and partially used by the Company. We own a 45,000 square foot facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico which is used for the development of our CoolRunner CPLD product families as well as IP cores. We lease office facilities for our engineering design centers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Austin, Texas, Grenoble, France and Edinburgh, Scotland. We also lease sales offices in various locations throughout North America, which include the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Nashua, Ottawa, Raleigh, San Diego, San Jose and Toronto as well as international sales offices located in the metropolitan areas of Brussels, Helsinki, Hong Kong, London, Milan, Munich, Osaka, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Stockholm, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Tokyo. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Internal Revenue Service The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company for fiscal 1996 through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. The Company filed a Tax Court petition with respect to fiscal 1996 through 1998 on March 26, 2001, with respect to fiscal 1999 on January 14, 2002 and with respect to fiscal 2000 on January 16, 2003. In addition, the IRS proposed adjustments to the Companys net operating loss for fiscal 2001. To date, all issues have been settled with the IRS except as described in the following paragraph. On August 30, 2005, the U.S. Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The U.S. Tax Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options is to be included in the cost sharing agreement. The U.S. Tax Court determined that the Company has no tax, interest, or penalties due for this issue. The decision documents are expected to be filed, jointly by the Company and the IRS, with the Tax Court. After the Tax Court enters the decision, the IRS will have 90 days within which to appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Other than as stated above, we know of no legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or agency against the Company. Patent Litigation On October 17, 2005, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by Lizy K. John (John) against Xilinx, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division (the Court). John seeks an 17 injunction, unspecified damages and attorneys fees. The Company filed its answer on January 2, 2006, denying Johns allegations and alleging that the John patent is invalid and unenforceable because of inequitable conduct and failure to disclose information that was material to the prosecution of the John patent. John filed her reply on January 20, 2006. On May 8, 2006, the Court issued a Notice of Scheduling Conference, Proposed Deadlines for Docket Control Order and Discovery Order (the Order). The Order sets the scheduling conference on June 6, 2006, the claim construction hearing on March 22, 2007, the pretrial conference on August 30, 2007 and jury selection to commence on September 4, 2007. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to the Company is estimable at this time. Other Matters From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, distribution arrangements and employee relations matters. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report. 18   PART II  ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol XLNX. As of May 1, 2006, there were approximately 1,168 stockholders of record. Since many holders shares are listed under their brokerage firms names, the actual number of stockholders is estimated by the Company to be over 150,000. The following table sets forth the high and low closing sale prices, for the periods indicated, for our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ National Market: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 High Low High Low First Quarter $ 29.96 $ 25.48 $ 40.22 $ 31.53 Second Quarter 29.09 25.68 31.53 25.44 Third Quarter 28.14 21.94 32.95 26.68 Fourth Quarter 29.79 24.92 31.92 26.29 In each quarter of fiscal 2006, we paid a cash dividend of $0.07 per common share, for a total of $0.28 per common share for the year ($0.05 each quarter during fiscal 2005 for a total of $0.20 for the year). On April 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.07 per share to $0.09 per share, which is payable on May 31, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2006. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table summarizes the Companys repurchase of its common stock during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Cautionary Statement The statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this document. Forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking words, such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "plan," "intend," "project" or other similar words. We disclaim any responsibility to update any forward looking statement provided in this document. Nature of Operations We design, develop and market programmable logic solutions, including advanced ICs, software design tools, predefined system functions delivered as IP cores, design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in the communications, storage, server, consumer, automotive, industrial and other markets. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors, and through direct sales to OEMs by a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical policies include: valuation of marketable and non marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long lived assets including acquisition related intangibles, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; and accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Valuation of Marketable and Non marketable Securities The Companys short term and long term investments include marketable debt and equity securities and non marketable equity securities. At April 1, 2006, the Company had debt securities with a fair value of $1.5 billion, an equity investment in UMC, a publicly held Taiwanese semiconductor wafer manufacturing company, of $276.5 million, and strategic investments in non marketable equity securities of $17.7 million. The fair values for marketable debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. In determining if and when a decline in market value below adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity 21 securities is other than temporary, the Company evaluates quarterly the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition and other key measures for our investments. Xilinx adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 115 1, "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (FSP 115 1)," on January 1, 2006. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we assessed other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities in accordance with FSP 115 1. We have not recorded any other than temporary impairment for marketable debt and equity securities for fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. In determining whether a decline in value of non marketable equity investments in private companies is other than temporary, the assessment is made by considering available evidence including the general market conditions in the investees industry, the investees product development status, the investees ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investees need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current periods operating results to the extent of the decline. Based on our evaluation, we recorded impairment losses on investments on our consolidated statements of income, related to our investments in private companies of $1.4 million and $3.1 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue Recognition Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors end customers. For fiscal 2006, approximately 86% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributors end customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from the Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms. Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers. Revenue from software term licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue from support products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 8% of net revenues for all of the periods presented. Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances. Valuation of Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first in, first out method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we 22 write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts, which are also consistent with our short term manufacturing plans. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Including Acquisition Related Intangibles Long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. Goodwill As required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For purposes of impairment testing under SFAS 142, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2006. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for RocketChips, Triscend Corporation (Triscend), Hier Design Inc. (HDI) and AccelChip goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified. Accounting for Income Taxes Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities positions and our assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in periods when these changes occur. 23  We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. As of April 1, 2006 and April 2, 2005, we had a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets relating to certain California tax credit carryforwards. Results of Operations The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years indicated: 2006 2005 2004 Net Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 38.1 36.6 37.9 Gross Margin 61.9 63.4 62.1 Operating Expenses: Research and development 18.9 19.6 17.7 Selling, general and administrative 18.3 19.3 19.1 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 0.4 0.4 0.7 Impairment loss on excess facilities and equipment 0.0 0.0 0.2 Litigation settlements and contingencies 0.2 0.0 0.5 Write off of acquired in process research and development 0.2 0.5 0.5 Total operating expenses 38.0 39.8 38.7 Operating Income 23.9 23.6 23.4 Impairment loss on investments (0.1 ) (0.2 ) 0.0 Interest income and other, net 2.6 2.0 1.7 Income Before Income Taxes 26.4 25.4 25.1 Provision for income taxes 5.9 5.5 3.4 Net Income 20.5 % 19.9 % 21.7 % Net Revenues 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Net revenues $ 1,726,250 10 % $ 1,573,233 13 % $ 1,397,846 Net revenues of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006 represented the highest net revenues that Xilinx has ever achieved. The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2006 was a result of improved market conditions as compared to fiscal 2005 and continued strong customer demand for our New Products, primarily in the Communications and Industrial and Other end markets. The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2005 was due to strength in our New Products and growth in the Consumer and Automotive and Industrial and Other end markets. See "Net Revenues by Product" and "Net Revenues by End Markets" for more information on our product and end market categories. The increases in net revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005 resulted from increased unit sales, partially offset by normal declines in average unit selling prices as well as continued growth as a percentage of total net revenues of our high volume Spartan family, which has lower average selling prices. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented. 24 Net Revenues by Product We classify our product offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. These product categories, excluding Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect advances in technology. The most recent modification was on July 4, 2004, which was the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2005. Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the recategorization. New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the Spartan 3, Spartan 3E, Spartan IIE, Virtex 5, Virtex 4, Virtex II Pro, EasyPath and CoolRunner II product lines. Mainstream Products include the CoolRunner, Spartan II, SpartanXL, Virtex II, Virtex E and Virtex product lines. Base Products consist of our mature product families and include the XC3000, XC3100, XC4000, XC5200, XC9500, XC9500XL, XC9500XV, XC4000E, XC4000EX, XC4000XL, XC4000XLA, XC4000XV and Spartan families. Support Products make up the remainder of our product offerings and include configuration solutions (serial PROMs), software, IP cores, customer training, design services and support. Net revenues by product categories for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 2006 % of Total % Change 2005 % of Total % Change 2004 % of Total (In millions) New Products $ 551.5 32 99 % $ 277.1 18 207 % $ 90.2 6 Mainstream Products 812.8 47 (11 )% 912.6 58 0 % 911.0 65 Base Products 259.0 15 (8 )% 280.6 18 (7 )% 300.3 22 Support Products 102.9 6 0 % 102.9 6 7 % 96.3 7 Total Net Revenues $ 1,726.2 100 10 % $ 1,573.2 100 13 % $ 1,397.8 100 The increase in net revenues from New Products during fiscal 2006 was due to the strong unit growth resulting from the market acceptance of our Virtex 4, Virtex II Pro and Spartan 3 families across a broad base of end markets. Our 130 nanometer Virtex II Pro family, which is the PLD industrys first product family with embedded processing and transceiver functionality, is currently the largest contributor to the New Products net revenues. However, our design momentum is rapidly shifting to 90 nanometer technology. Our 90 nanometer products include our high volume, low cost Spartan 3 and Spartan 3E families and our high performance, high density Virtex 4 FPGA family. Sales from these products increased significantly during fiscal 2006. The increase in net revenues from New Products for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to the strong market acceptance of Virtex II Pro, Spartan 3 and Spartan IIE across a broad base of applications, including wireless communications, networking and consumer. We expect that sales of New Products will continue to increase as customers continue to adopt these products and begin moving their programs into volume production. In fiscal 2006, Mainstream Products declined compared to the prior fiscal year because of a decline in sales of some of our older products manufactured using 150 nanometer and 180 nanometer process technologies, including Virtex E, Virtex II and Spartan II. The decrease in net revenues for this product category resulted from both a decline in units sold as well as in average selling prices. The relatively flat performance of Mainstream Products in fiscal 2005 was due to strength in the Consumer and Automotive end market offset by weakness in the Storage and Servers end market. The decline in Base Products in fiscal 2006 and 2005 was due to lower units sold for older generation products as they progress into the mature stage of their lifecycles. Support Products were virtually unchanged in fiscal 2006 and represented 6% of total net revenues. Support Products grew in fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year period mainly due to improvement in design services, software and configuration solutions (serial PROMs). 25 Net Revenues by Geography Geographic revenue information reflects the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased our products. This may differ from the geographic location of the end customers. Net revenues by geography for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 2006 % of Total % Change 2005 % of Total % Change 2004 % of Total (In millions) North America $ 714.9 41 9 % $ 655.1 42 11 % $ 592.5 42 Europe 352.8 20 8 % 326.1 21 21 % 270.3 19 Japan 251.8 15 12 % 224.1 14 10 % 203.6 15 APAC/ROW 406.7 24 11 % 367.9 23 11 % 331.4 24 Total Net Revenues $ 1,726.2 100 10 % $ 1,573.2 100 13 % $ 1,397.8 100 Net revenues in North America, Europe, Japan and the Asia Pacific region/Rest of World (APAC/ROW) all increased during fiscal 2006 and 2005 compared to the prior years. The increases in net revenues in both years for APAC/ROW were due to continued strength in communications and consumer applications as well as continued outsourcing of manufacturing operations to the Asia Pacific region by large OEMs. In fiscal 2006, the increase in Japan net revenues was driven by an increase in sales to customers in the Communications end market. In fiscal 2005, the increase was driven by strong consumer sales. The increases in net revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005 for North America were driven primarily by strength in Communications and Industrial and Other end markets. Net revenues in Europe benefited from the recent strength in the Communications and Industrial and Other end markets during fiscal 2006, including test and measurement and audio/video broadcast applications. In fiscal 2005, European net revenues increased as a result of increased demand from communications, consumer and automotive applications. Net Revenues by End Markets Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers primary markets. In order to better reflect our diversification efforts and to provide more detailed end market information, we split the category formerly called "Consumer, Industrial and Other" into two components: "Consumer and Automotive" and "Industrial and Other" beginning with the quarter ended January 1, 2005. We will begin to show historical comparisons of the two new categories when information is available for all periods presented. As a result, we classify our net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications, Storage and Servers, Consumer and Automotive, and Industrial and Other. Since historical comparisons of the two new categories are not available, we combined them in the table below to show their aggregated changes over the three fiscal years. The percentage change calculation in the table below represents the year to year dollar change in each end market. Net revenues by end markets for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 2006 % Change in Dollars 2005 % Change in Dollars 2004 (% of total net revenues) Communications 49 % 7 % 50 % 12 % 50 % Storage and Servers 11 (10 )% 14 (15 )% 19 Consumer, Automotive, Industrial and Other 40 21 % 36 30 % 31 Total Net Revenues 100 % 10 % 100 % 13 % 100 % As in fiscal 2005, growth in the Communications end market in fiscal 2006 was driven by increases in both wireless and wireline communication applications. This market has been relatively flat as a percentage of revenues for the past three fiscal years. 26 The increase in net revenues from the combined category of Consumer, Automotive, Industrial and Other was primarily driven by strength in test and measurement, audio/video broadcast, industrial, scientific and medical applications as well as defense applications. The net revenue increase in this category during fiscal 2005 was due to increased acceptance of programmable logic solutions in digital consumer, defense and automotive applications. Net revenues from the Storage and Servers end market declined during fiscal 2006 and 2005 as compared to the prior years due to selected customer programs migrating to lower cost alternatives. However, we believe these transitions are nearly complete. Gross Margin 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Gross margin $ 1,069,131 7 % $ 996,949 15 % $ 867,878 Percentage of net revenues 61.9 % 63.4 % 62.1 % The gross margin decline of 1.5 percentage points for fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005, was due to a significant shift in product mix towards 130 nanometer and 90 nanometer products, which accounted for a 99% year over year growth in sales from our New Products category. Additionally, sales from Mainstream and Base Products, which have higher gross margins than the New Products, declined. In fiscal 2006, New Products represented 32% of our total net revenues, compared with 18% in fiscal 2005. New products traditionally have lower margins in the early product life cycle due to higher unit costs resulting from lower yields. As the product matures, the optimization of yields improves gross margins. The gross margin improvement of 1.3 percentage points in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due to improved yields and manufacturing costs in our New Products and high volume Mainstream Products. Gross margin may be adversely affected in the future due to product mix shifts, competitive pricing pressure, manufacturing yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate these risks by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving manufacturing efficiency with our suppliers. Sales of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to offset much of the revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer products. Research and Development 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Research and development $ 326,126 6 % $ 307,448 24 % $ 247,609 Percentage of net revenues 19 % 20 % 18 % The increase in research and development (R&D) expenses from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily related to additional headcount to support our new product development and increased investments in new markets such as DSP and embedded processing. The increase was also attributed to the expenses associated with the tapeout of our latest Virtex 4 and Virtex 5 platform products for LX, FX and SX devices. The increase in R&D expenses from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily related to higher mask and wafer expenses for development of new 90 nanometer products. We also invested in additional resources for next generation products and IP development related to new market opportunities such as DSP and embedded processing. 27 We plan to continue to invest in R&D efforts in a wide variety of areas such as new products, 65 nanometer and more advanced process development, IP cores, DSP, embedded processing and the development of new design and layout software. We will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas. Selling, General and Administrative 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 316,302 4 % $ 303,595 14 % $ 266,664 Percentage of net revenues 18 % 19 % 19 % The increase in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in fiscal 2006 compared to the same period last year was due to salary and headcount increases and commissions associated with higher net revenues. This was offset slightly by reductions in our tax litigation and Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 compliance costs. The increase in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was attributable to start up costs for our new regional headquarters in Singapore, tax litigation costs, initial year Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 compliance costs and commissions associated with higher revenues. Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles Amortization expense for all acquisition related intangible assets for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $7.0 million, $6.7 million and $9.8 million, respectively, primarily related to intangible assets arising from the RocketChips, Triscend, HDI and AccelChip acquisitions. Amortization expense for these intangible assets increased slightly for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year, due to the acquisition of HDI in June 2004 and AccelChip in January 2006. We expect amortization of acquisition related intangibles to be approximately $8.0 million for fiscal 2007 compared with $7.0 million for fiscal 2006. Impairment Losses The impairment losses on investments of $1.4 million and $3.1 million recognized during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, were related to non marketable equity securities in private companies. The impairment losses resulted from certain investees diluting Xilinxs investment through the receipt of an additional round of investment at a lower valuation or from the liquidation of certain investees. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company sold excess facilities consisting of two buildings and land near downtown San Jose, California for $33.8 million ($32.0 million, net of selling costs). After recognizing previous impairment losses on these excess facilities of $53.8 million in fiscal 2003 and $3.4 million in fiscal 2004, there was no gain or loss on the sale of the buildings and land. Litigation Settlements and Contingencies In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we accrued an additional $3.2 million that represented anticipated payments for liability for legal contingencies. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded a $6.4 million expense related to a litigation settlement with Aldec, Inc. and a contingent liability with Reptronic. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Write Off of Acquired In Process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of AccelChip in January 2006, $4.5 million of in process research and development costs were written off. The projects identified as in process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility. These projects, as well as the HDI and Triscend development projects referred to below, had identifiable technological risk factors indicating that successful completion, although expected, was not assured. If an identified project is not successfully 28 completed, there is no alternative future use for the project, therefore, the expected future income will not be realized. The acquired in process research and development represented the fair value of technologies in the development stage that had not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses. The acquired in process research and development components consist of algorithmic synthesis software and IP libraries for high performance DSP design in FPGAs. We plan to sell these products to new and existing Xilinx customers and over time integrate them with our existing DSP software products. These projects were approximately 45% complete at the time of acquisition. We expect to complete all of the development projects by the end of fiscal 2009 with an estimated cost to complete of $3.5 million. In connection with the acquisition of HDI in June 2004, $7.2 million of in process research and development costs were written off. The projects identified as in process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility. The acquired in process research and development components consist of hierarchical floorplanning and analysis software for high performance FPGA design. We currently sell these products to Xilinx customers, and over time, the products will be enhanced. At the time of the acquisition, these products were approximately 67% complete. At that time, we expected to complete the development project by the end of fiscal 2005 with an estimated cost to complete of $1.1 million. The development project was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 at a cost that approximated the original estimate. In connection with the Triscend acquisition in March 2004, $7.0 million of in process research and development costs were written off. The projects identified as in process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility. The acquired in process research and development components consist of a graphical user interface and design implementation software. We have no further plans to fully integrate Triscends graphical user interface and design implementation software into our products, however some elements and concepts of this technology are likely to be integrated into various software tools we supply to our customers. Triscends tools were completed as of December 2004. Integration of some elements and concepts occurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 and will continue to occur during fiscal 2007. To determine the value of Triscends, HDIs and AccelChips in process research and development, the expected future cash flow attributable to the in process technology was discounted, taking into account the percentage of completion, utilization of pre existing "core" technology, risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology, existing and future markets, and technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology. We expensed these non recurring charges in the period of acquisition. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Interest Income and Other, Net 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Interest income and other, net $ 45,958 45 % $ 31,603 35 % $ 23,409 Percentage of net revenues 3 % 2 % 2 % For fiscal 2006, the increase in interest income and other, net compared to fiscal 2005, was due to higher yields resulting from an increase in short term interest rates and $4.0 million of interest income earned from an IRS prepayment relating to a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in favor of the Company. See Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The increase in interest income and other, net from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances and higher yields achieved by switching a larger portion of the investments to longer duration portfolios as well as into taxable instruments. 29  Provision for Income Taxes 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 102,453 17 % $ 87,821 85 % $ 47,555 Effective tax rate 22 % 22 % 14 % The effective tax rates in all years reflected the impact of foreign income (loss) at different statutory rates and tax credits earned in the United States. During fiscal 2006, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan to repatriate $500.0 million of permanently reinvested earnings from the Companys foreign subsidiaries. This plan qualifies for the 85% dividends received deduction provided for under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). These earnings were repatriated in March 2006. See Note 2 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." When compared to fiscal 2005, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was relatively flat. There were, however, significant offsetting items during the period. The increase in tax was primarily attributable to the approval of the special one time AJCA dividend that was repatriated from the Companys foreign subsidiaries prior to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. This resulted in the recognition of approximately $24.9 million of federal and state tax expense. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the provision for income taxes was reduced by a net tax benefit of $8.9 million ($0.03 per share) for the correction of certain individually immaterial adjustments primarily related to prior periods. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for further discussion. Additionally, the Company recognized the benefit of deferred tax assets related to certain California state tax credits of $8.9 million that were previously subject to a valuation allowance. Management determined that it was more likely than not that the asset would be realized and, accordingly, released a substantial portion of the valuation allowance. Further, the Company released tax reserves of $9.4 million related to the favorable ruling by the U.S. Tax Court for Xilinx in its litigation with the IRS for fiscal 1996 to 1999. During fiscal 2005, the Company repatriated $450.0 million of earnings from its foreign operations, on which taxes were previously provided. This resulted in the utilization of significant amounts of net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, the Company recorded a one time benefit of $4.7 million for reversing previously provided taxes relating to an IRS audit. The Company was under examination by the IRS for its fiscal 1996 through 2001. All issues have been settled with the exception of issues related to Xilinx U.S.s cost sharing arrangement with Xilinx Ireland. On August 30, 2005, the U.S. Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The U.S. Tax Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options is to be included in the cost sharing agreement. Accordingly, there are no additional taxes, penalties or interest due for this issue. The decision documents are expected to be filed, jointly by the Company and the IRS, with the Tax Court. After the Tax Court enters the decision, the IRS will have 90 days within which to appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities and in UMC stock are available for future sale. 30 Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments at April 1, 2006 and April 2, 2005 totaled $1.6 billion for both periods. As of April 1, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $984.9 million and working capital of $1.3 billion. Cash provided by operations of $489.4 million for fiscal 2006 was $213.9 million higher than the $275.5 million generated during fiscal 2005. Cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for noncash related items, a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors, which were partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as other assets. The increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as other assets were primarily related to the second $50.0 million advance wafer purchase payment paid to Toshiba in September 2005 and $17.8 million of investments in intellectual property and licenses. In October 2004, the Company entered into an advanced purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company would pay Toshiba a total of $100.0 million in two equal installments for advance payment of silicon wafers produced under the agreement. The entire advance payment of $100.0 million is being reduced by future wafer purchases from Toshiba and any unused portion is fully refundable in December 2006 if Toshiba is not able to maintain ongoing production and quality criteria or if future wafer purchases do not exceed the total amount advanced. The balance of the advance payment remaining was $72.3 million at April 1, 2006. Net cash provided by investing activities of $242.4 million during fiscal 2006 included net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale securities of $353.3 million, which was partially offset by $67.0 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, $19.5 million for the purchase of AccelChip and $24.4 million for other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $397.8 million in fiscal 2006 consisting of $401.6 million for the repurchase of common stock and $97.2 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $101.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments decreased 9% from $213.5 million at the end of fiscal 2005 to $194.2 million at the end of fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to strong collections during fiscal 2006 that were partially offset by increased shipments. The decrease was also partially attributable to the change in payment terms from 45 days to 30 days for some North American customers. Days sales outstanding decreased to 41 days at April 1, 2006 from 49 days at April 2, 2005. Inventories Inventories increased from $185.7 million at April 2, 2005 to $201.0 million at April 1, 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased inventory in our new products to support forecasted revenue growth. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were relatively flat at 145 days at April 1, 2006 compared to 146 days at April 2, 2005. We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand. Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2006, we invested $67.0 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $61.4 million in fiscal 2005. Primary investments in fiscal 2006 were for computer equipment, IT equipment, test 31 equipment and building improvements. We expect that property, plant and equipment expenditures will increase in the future due to the expansion of our regional headquarters in Singapore. Current Liabilities Current liabilities increased from $298.4 million at the end of fiscal 2005 to $345.0 million at the end of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors, accrued payroll and related liabilities and other accrued liabilities. The increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to higher inventory in the distributor channel as a result of overall increased sales levels. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased $55.4 million during fiscal 2006, principally as a result of $354.1 million in net income for fiscal 2006, the issuance of common shares and treasury stock under employee stock plans of $104.1 million, the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $40.6 million, $44.7 million for the reversal of reserves for cost sharing as a result of the U.S. Tax Court decision mentioned above, $17.2 million in unrealized gains on available for sale securities, net of deferred taxes, primarily from our investment in UMC stock and $853 thousand for noncash compensation expense and unrealized gains on hedging transactions. The increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $400.0 million, as adjusted for accrued and unsettled transactions, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $97.2 million, tax reconciliation and reclassification adjustments of $7.3 million and cumulative translation adjustment of $1.7 million. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments at April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004 totaled $1.6 billion for both periods. As of April 2, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $861.6 million and working capital of $1.2 billion. Cash provided by operations of $275.5 million for fiscal 2005 was $157.0 million lower than the $432.5 million generated during fiscal 2004. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for noncash related items and a decrease in accounts receivable which were partially offset by increases in inventories, deferred income taxes, an advance wafer purchase payment of $50.0 million to Toshiba and a decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors. Net cash used in investing activities of $45.1 million during fiscal 2005 included $61.4 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and $18.4 million for the acquisition of HDI, partially offset by $34.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities. Net cash used in financing activities was $118.3 million in fiscal 2005 consisting of $133.8 million for the repurchase of common stock and $69.6 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $85.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments decreased 14% from $249.0 million at the end of fiscal 2004 to $213.5 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily attributable to better linearity of shipments to distributors during the three months ended April 2, 2005 as compared to the three months ended April 3, 2004 and a decreased level of shipments. Days sales outstanding decreased from 66 days at April 3, 2004 to 49 days at April 2, 2005. Inventories Inventories increased from $102.5 million at April 3, 2004 to $185.7 million at April 2, 2005. The increase was due to an inventory build up from unusually low inventory levels in fiscal 2004 for an anticipated 32 growth in sales for the second half of calendar 2004 that did not materialize and the ramping of new products. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2005, we invested $61.4 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $41.0 million in fiscal 2004. Primary investments in fiscal 2005 were for computer equipment, IT equipment, test equipment and building improvements. Current Liabilities Current liabilities decreased from $381.1 million at the end of fiscal 2004 to $298.4 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decreases in deferred income on shipments to distributors, accounts payable and income taxes payable. The decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to lower inventory in the distributor channel. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased $190.4 million during fiscal 2005, principally as a result of $312.7 million in net income for the year ended April 2, 2005, the issuance of common shares and treasury stock under employee stock plans of $84.5 million, $504 thousand in amortization of deferred compensation related to the RocketChips acquisition, the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $51.9 million and cumulative translation adjustment of $897 thousand. The increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $134.6 million, as adjusted for accrued and unsettled transactions, the payment of our first full year of dividends to stockholders of $69.7 million and $55.8 million in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, net of deferred taxes, primarily from our investment in UMC stock. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at April 1, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities at April 1, 2006. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (In millions) Operating lease obligations(1) $ 32.7 $ 6.9 $ 10.7 $ 6.7 $ 8.4 New building commitment(2) 39.0 24.0 15.0 Inventory and other purchase obligations(3) 76.8 76.8 Electronic design automation software licenses(4) 15.6 9.0 6.6 Intellectual property license rights obligations(5) 20.0 20.0 Total $ 184.1 $ 116.7 $ 52.3 $ 6.7 $ 8.4 (1)We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under operating leases that expire at various dates through November 2035. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was approximately $6.5 million for fiscal 2006. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about operating leases. (2)In November 2005, Xilinx announced a $40.0 million investment in a new building in Singapore, the Companys Asia Pacific regional headquarters. As of April 1, 2006, approximately $39.0 million of our investment commitment remains outstanding. The project is expected to be completed in June 2007. (3)Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and 33 services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. (4)As of April 1, 2006, the Company has approximately $15.6 million of non cancelable operating lease obligations to providers of electronic design automation software expiring at various dates through July 2008. (5)In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company committed up to $20.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual property acquired. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R). This statement replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123(R) will require the Company to measure the cost of all employee stock based compensation awards that are expected to be exercised and which are granted after the effective date based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (generally over the vesting period of the award). In addition, the Company is required to record compensation expense (as previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. SFAS 123(R) will become effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will implement the standard for the fiscal year beginning April 2, 2006 using the modified prospective method. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method will have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the stock price. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about SFAS 123(R) and other recent accounting pronouncements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of April 1, 2006, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Summary of Liquidity and Capital Resources On April 25, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The dividend is payable on May 31, 2006 to stockholders of record on May 10, 2006. On April 20, 2005, our Board of Directors declared an increase in the dividend rate on our common stock from $0.05 to $0.07 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The dividend was paid on June 1, 2005 to stockholders of record on May 11, 2005. On July 20 and October 19, 2005 and January 18, 2006, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.07 per common share for the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 which were paid on September 7 and December 1, 2005 and March 1, 2006, respectively, to stockholders of record on August 17 and November 17, 2005 and February 8, 2006, respectively. For fiscal 2005, the Board of Directors declared four quarterly common stock dividends of $0.05 per share each for a total of $0.20 per share for the entire fiscal year. Our dividend policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs and other strategic investments. We anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A and below could affect our cash positions adversely. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business. 34  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.5 billion at April 1, 2006. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. The portfolio includes tax advantaged municipal bonds, taxable and tax advantaged auction rate securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government agency bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market interest rates compared to interest rates at April 1, 2006 would not materially affect the fair value of our available for sale securities and the impact on our investment portfolio would have been less than $10.0 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained, are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. We will enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of April 1, 2006, we had approximately U.S. $12.8 million of outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against the Euro, approximately U.S. $4.1 million of outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against the Japanese Yen and approximately U.S. $15.9 million of outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against the Singapore dollar. The net unrealized gain or loss which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts was immaterial at April 1, 2006. The contracts expire at various dates between April 2006 and June 2007. Our investments in several wholly owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at each quarter end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, as our subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies, exchange rate fluctuations will occur. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 1, 2006 would have affected the value of our investments in foreign currency denominated subsidiaries by less than $12.0 million. Equity Security Price Risk Our investment in marketable equity securities at April 1, 2006 consists almost entirely of our investment in UMC, which consists of shares of common stock, the value of which is determined by the closing price on the Taiwan Stock Exchange as of the balance sheet date. This value is converted from New Taiwan dollars into U.S. dollars and included in our determination of the change in the fair value of our investment in UMC which is accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). The market value of our investment in UMC was approximately $276.5 million at April 1, 2006 as compared to our adjusted cost basis of approximately $239.0 million. The value of our investment in UMC would be materially impacted if there was a significant change in the market price of the UMC shares and or New Taiwan dollars. Excluding the effect of any changes in the New Taiwan dollar, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in UMCs stock price compared to the stock price at April 1, 2006 would have affected the value of our investment in UMC by less than $28.0 million. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about our UMC investment. 35   
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Cautionary Statement The statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this document. Forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking words, such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "plan," "intend," "project" or other similar words. We disclaim any responsibility to update any forward looking statement provided in this document. Nature of Operations We design, develop and market programmable logic solutions, including advanced ICs, software design tools, predefined system functions delivered as IP cores, design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in the communications, storage, server, consumer, automotive, industrial and other markets. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors, and through direct sales to OEMs by a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical policies include: valuation of marketable and non marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long lived assets including acquisition related intangibles, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; and accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Valuation of Marketable and Non marketable Securities The Companys short term and long term investments include marketable debt and equity securities and non marketable equity securities. At April 1, 2006, the Company had debt securities with a fair value of $1.5 billion, an equity investment in UMC, a publicly held Taiwanese semiconductor wafer manufacturing company, of $276.5 million, and strategic investments in non marketable equity securities of $17.7 million. The fair values for marketable debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. In determining if and when a decline in market value below adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity 21 securities is other than temporary, the Company evaluates quarterly the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition and other key measures for our investments. Xilinx adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 115 1, "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (FSP 115 1)," on January 1, 2006. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we assessed other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities in accordance with FSP 115 1. We have not recorded any other than temporary impairment for marketable debt and equity securities for fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. In determining whether a decline in value of non marketable equity investments in private companies is other than temporary, the assessment is made by considering available evidence including the general market conditions in the investees industry, the investees product development status, the investees ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investees need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current periods operating results to the extent of the decline. Based on our evaluation, we recorded impairment losses on investments on our consolidated statements of income, related to our investments in private companies of $1.4 million and $3.1 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue Recognition Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors end customers. For fiscal 2006, approximately 86% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributors end customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from the Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms. Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers. Revenue from software term licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue from support products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 8% of net revenues for all of the periods presented. Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances. Valuation of Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first in, first out method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we 22 write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts, which are also consistent with our short term manufacturing plans. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. Impairment of Long Lived Assets Including Acquisition Related Intangibles Long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. Goodwill As required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For purposes of impairment testing under SFAS 142, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2006. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for RocketChips, Triscend Corporation (Triscend), Hier Design Inc. (HDI) and AccelChip goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified. Accounting for Income Taxes Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities positions and our assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in periods when these changes occur. 23  We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. As of April 1, 2006 and April 2, 2005, we had a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets relating to certain California tax credit carryforwards. Results of Operations The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years indicated: 2006 2005 2004 Net Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 38.1 36.6 37.9 Gross Margin 61.9 63.4 62.1 Operating Expenses: Research and development 18.9 19.6 17.7 Selling, general and administrative 18.3 19.3 19.1 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 0.4 0.4 0.7 Impairment loss on excess facilities and equipment 0.0 0.0 0.2 Litigation settlements and contingencies 0.2 0.0 0.5 Write off of acquired in process research and development 0.2 0.5 0.5 Total operating expenses 38.0 39.8 38.7 Operating Income 23.9 23.6 23.4 Impairment loss on investments (0.1 ) (0.2 ) 0.0 Interest income and other, net 2.6 2.0 1.7 Income Before Income Taxes 26.4 25.4 25.1 Provision for income taxes 5.9 5.5 3.4 Net Income 20.5 % 19.9 % 21.7 % Net Revenues 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Net revenues $ 1,726,250 10 % $ 1,573,233 13 % $ 1,397,846 Net revenues of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2006 represented the highest net revenues that Xilinx has ever achieved. The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2006 was a result of improved market conditions as compared to fiscal 2005 and continued strong customer demand for our New Products, primarily in the Communications and Industrial and Other end markets. The increase in net revenues in fiscal 2005 was due to strength in our New Products and growth in the Consumer and Automotive and Industrial and Other end markets. See "Net Revenues by Product" and "Net Revenues by End Markets" for more information on our product and end market categories. The increases in net revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005 resulted from increased unit sales, partially offset by normal declines in average unit selling prices as well as continued growth as a percentage of total net revenues of our high volume Spartan family, which has lower average selling prices. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented. 24 Net Revenues by Product We classify our product offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. These product categories, excluding Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect advances in technology. The most recent modification was on July 4, 2004, which was the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2005. Amounts for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the recategorization. New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the Spartan 3, Spartan 3E, Spartan IIE, Virtex 5, Virtex 4, Virtex II Pro, EasyPath and CoolRunner II product lines. Mainstream Products include the CoolRunner, Spartan II, SpartanXL, Virtex II, Virtex E and Virtex product lines. Base Products consist of our mature product families and include the XC3000, XC3100, XC4000, XC5200, XC9500, XC9500XL, XC9500XV, XC4000E, XC4000EX, XC4000XL, XC4000XLA, XC4000XV and Spartan families. Support Products make up the remainder of our product offerings and include configuration solutions (serial PROMs), software, IP cores, customer training, design services and support. Net revenues by product categories for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 2006 % of Total % Change 2005 % of Total % Change 2004 % of Total (In millions) New Products $ 551.5 32 99 % $ 277.1 18 207 % $ 90.2 6 Mainstream Products 812.8 47 (11 )% 912.6 58 0 % 911.0 65 Base Products 259.0 15 (8 )% 280.6 18 (7 )% 300.3 22 Support Products 102.9 6 0 % 102.9 6 7 % 96.3 7 Total Net Revenues $ 1,726.2 100 10 % $ 1,573.2 100 13 % $ 1,397.8 100 The increase in net revenues from New Products during fiscal 2006 was due to the strong unit growth resulting from the market acceptance of our Virtex 4, Virtex II Pro and Spartan 3 families across a broad base of end markets. Our 130 nanometer Virtex II Pro family, which is the PLD industrys first product family with embedded processing and transceiver functionality, is currently the largest contributor to the New Products net revenues. However, our design momentum is rapidly shifting to 90 nanometer technology. Our 90 nanometer products include our high volume, low cost Spartan 3 and Spartan 3E families and our high performance, high density Virtex 4 FPGA family. Sales from these products increased significantly during fiscal 2006. The increase in net revenues from New Products for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to the strong market acceptance of Virtex II Pro, Spartan 3 and Spartan IIE across a broad base of applications, including wireless communications, networking and consumer. We expect that sales of New Products will continue to increase as customers continue to adopt these products and begin moving their programs into volume production. In fiscal 2006, Mainstream Products declined compared to the prior fiscal year because of a decline in sales of some of our older products manufactured using 150 nanometer and 180 nanometer process technologies, including Virtex E, Virtex II and Spartan II. The decrease in net revenues for this product category resulted from both a decline in units sold as well as in average selling prices. The relatively flat performance of Mainstream Products in fiscal 2005 was due to strength in the Consumer and Automotive end market offset by weakness in the Storage and Servers end market. The decline in Base Products in fiscal 2006 and 2005 was due to lower units sold for older generation products as they progress into the mature stage of their lifecycles. Support Products were virtually unchanged in fiscal 2006 and represented 6% of total net revenues. Support Products grew in fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year period mainly due to improvement in design services, software and configuration solutions (serial PROMs). 25 Net Revenues by Geography Geographic revenue information reflects the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased our products. This may differ from the geographic location of the end customers. Net revenues by geography for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 2006 % of Total % Change 2005 % of Total % Change 2004 % of Total (In millions) North America $ 714.9 41 9 % $ 655.1 42 11 % $ 592.5 42 Europe 352.8 20 8 % 326.1 21 21 % 270.3 19 Japan 251.8 15 12 % 224.1 14 10 % 203.6 15 APAC/ROW 406.7 24 11 % 367.9 23 11 % 331.4 24 Total Net Revenues $ 1,726.2 100 10 % $ 1,573.2 100 13 % $ 1,397.8 100 Net revenues in North America, Europe, Japan and the Asia Pacific region/Rest of World (APAC/ROW) all increased during fiscal 2006 and 2005 compared to the prior years. The increases in net revenues in both years for APAC/ROW were due to continued strength in communications and consumer applications as well as continued outsourcing of manufacturing operations to the Asia Pacific region by large OEMs. In fiscal 2006, the increase in Japan net revenues was driven by an increase in sales to customers in the Communications end market. In fiscal 2005, the increase was driven by strong consumer sales. The increases in net revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005 for North America were driven primarily by strength in Communications and Industrial and Other end markets. Net revenues in Europe benefited from the recent strength in the Communications and Industrial and Other end markets during fiscal 2006, including test and measurement and audio/video broadcast applications. In fiscal 2005, European net revenues increased as a result of increased demand from communications, consumer and automotive applications. Net Revenues by End Markets Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers primary markets. In order to better reflect our diversification efforts and to provide more detailed end market information, we split the category formerly called "Consumer, Industrial and Other" into two components: "Consumer and Automotive" and "Industrial and Other" beginning with the quarter ended January 1, 2005. We will begin to show historical comparisons of the two new categories when information is available for all periods presented. As a result, we classify our net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications, Storage and Servers, Consumer and Automotive, and Industrial and Other. Since historical comparisons of the two new categories are not available, we combined them in the table below to show their aggregated changes over the three fiscal years. The percentage change calculation in the table below represents the year to year dollar change in each end market. Net revenues by end markets for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: 2006 % Change in Dollars 2005 % Change in Dollars 2004 (% of total net revenues) Communications 49 % 7 % 50 % 12 % 50 % Storage and Servers 11 (10 )% 14 (15 )% 19 Consumer, Automotive, Industrial and Other 40 21 % 36 30 % 31 Total Net Revenues 100 % 10 % 100 % 13 % 100 % As in fiscal 2005, growth in the Communications end market in fiscal 2006 was driven by increases in both wireless and wireline communication applications. This market has been relatively flat as a percentage of revenues for the past three fiscal years. 26 The increase in net revenues from the combined category of Consumer, Automotive, Industrial and Other was primarily driven by strength in test and measurement, audio/video broadcast, industrial, scientific and medical applications as well as defense applications. The net revenue increase in this category during fiscal 2005 was due to increased acceptance of programmable logic solutions in digital consumer, defense and automotive applications. Net revenues from the Storage and Servers end market declined during fiscal 2006 and 2005 as compared to the prior years due to selected customer programs migrating to lower cost alternatives. However, we believe these transitions are nearly complete. Gross Margin 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Gross margin $ 1,069,131 7 % $ 996,949 15 % $ 867,878 Percentage of net revenues 61.9 % 63.4 % 62.1 % The gross margin decline of 1.5 percentage points for fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005, was due to a significant shift in product mix towards 130 nanometer and 90 nanometer products, which accounted for a 99% year over year growth in sales from our New Products category. Additionally, sales from Mainstream and Base Products, which have higher gross margins than the New Products, declined. In fiscal 2006, New Products represented 32% of our total net revenues, compared with 18% in fiscal 2005. New products traditionally have lower margins in the early product life cycle due to higher unit costs resulting from lower yields. As the product matures, the optimization of yields improves gross margins. The gross margin improvement of 1.3 percentage points in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due to improved yields and manufacturing costs in our New Products and high volume Mainstream Products. Gross margin may be adversely affected in the future due to product mix shifts, competitive pricing pressure, manufacturing yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate these risks by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving manufacturing efficiency with our suppliers. Sales of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to offset much of the revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer products. Research and Development 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Research and development $ 326,126 6 % $ 307,448 24 % $ 247,609 Percentage of net revenues 19 % 20 % 18 % The increase in research and development (R&D) expenses from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily related to additional headcount to support our new product development and increased investments in new markets such as DSP and embedded processing. The increase was also attributed to the expenses associated with the tapeout of our latest Virtex 4 and Virtex 5 platform products for LX, FX and SX devices. The increase in R&D expenses from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily related to higher mask and wafer expenses for development of new 90 nanometer products. We also invested in additional resources for next generation products and IP development related to new market opportunities such as DSP and embedded processing. 27 We plan to continue to invest in R&D efforts in a wide variety of areas such as new products, 65 nanometer and more advanced process development, IP cores, DSP, embedded processing and the development of new design and layout software. We will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas. Selling, General and Administrative 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Selling, general and administrative $ 316,302 4 % $ 303,595 14 % $ 266,664 Percentage of net revenues 18 % 19 % 19 % The increase in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in fiscal 2006 compared to the same period last year was due to salary and headcount increases and commissions associated with higher net revenues. This was offset slightly by reductions in our tax litigation and Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 compliance costs. The increase in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was attributable to start up costs for our new regional headquarters in Singapore, tax litigation costs, initial year Sarbanes Oxley Section 404 compliance costs and commissions associated with higher revenues. Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles Amortization expense for all acquisition related intangible assets for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $7.0 million, $6.7 million and $9.8 million, respectively, primarily related to intangible assets arising from the RocketChips, Triscend, HDI and AccelChip acquisitions. Amortization expense for these intangible assets increased slightly for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year, due to the acquisition of HDI in June 2004 and AccelChip in January 2006. We expect amortization of acquisition related intangibles to be approximately $8.0 million for fiscal 2007 compared with $7.0 million for fiscal 2006. Impairment Losses The impairment losses on investments of $1.4 million and $3.1 million recognized during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, were related to non marketable equity securities in private companies. The impairment losses resulted from certain investees diluting Xilinxs investment through the receipt of an additional round of investment at a lower valuation or from the liquidation of certain investees. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company sold excess facilities consisting of two buildings and land near downtown San Jose, California for $33.8 million ($32.0 million, net of selling costs). After recognizing previous impairment losses on these excess facilities of $53.8 million in fiscal 2003 and $3.4 million in fiscal 2004, there was no gain or loss on the sale of the buildings and land. Litigation Settlements and Contingencies In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we accrued an additional $3.2 million that represented anticipated payments for liability for legal contingencies. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded a $6.4 million expense related to a litigation settlement with Aldec, Inc. and a contingent liability with Reptronic. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Write Off of Acquired In Process Research and Development In connection with the acquisition of AccelChip in January 2006, $4.5 million of in process research and development costs were written off. The projects identified as in process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility. These projects, as well as the HDI and Triscend development projects referred to below, had identifiable technological risk factors indicating that successful completion, although expected, was not assured. If an identified project is not successfully 28 completed, there is no alternative future use for the project, therefore, the expected future income will not be realized. The acquired in process research and development represented the fair value of technologies in the development stage that had not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses. The acquired in process research and development components consist of algorithmic synthesis software and IP libraries for high performance DSP design in FPGAs. We plan to sell these products to new and existing Xilinx customers and over time integrate them with our existing DSP software products. These projects were approximately 45% complete at the time of acquisition. We expect to complete all of the development projects by the end of fiscal 2009 with an estimated cost to complete of $3.5 million. In connection with the acquisition of HDI in June 2004, $7.2 million of in process research and development costs were written off. The projects identified as in process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility. The acquired in process research and development components consist of hierarchical floorplanning and analysis software for high performance FPGA design. We currently sell these products to Xilinx customers, and over time, the products will be enhanced. At the time of the acquisition, these products were approximately 67% complete. At that time, we expected to complete the development project by the end of fiscal 2005 with an estimated cost to complete of $1.1 million. The development project was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 at a cost that approximated the original estimate. In connection with the Triscend acquisition in March 2004, $7.0 million of in process research and development costs were written off. The projects identified as in process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility. The acquired in process research and development components consist of a graphical user interface and design implementation software. We have no further plans to fully integrate Triscends graphical user interface and design implementation software into our products, however some elements and concepts of this technology are likely to be integrated into various software tools we supply to our customers. Triscends tools were completed as of December 2004. Integration of some elements and concepts occurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 and will continue to occur during fiscal 2007. To determine the value of Triscends, HDIs and AccelChips in process research and development, the expected future cash flow attributable to the in process technology was discounted, taking into account the percentage of completion, utilization of pre existing "core" technology, risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology, existing and future markets, and technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology. We expensed these non recurring charges in the period of acquisition. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Interest Income and Other, Net 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Interest income and other, net $ 45,958 45 % $ 31,603 35 % $ 23,409 Percentage of net revenues 3 % 2 % 2 % For fiscal 2006, the increase in interest income and other, net compared to fiscal 2005, was due to higher yields resulting from an increase in short term interest rates and $4.0 million of interest income earned from an IRS prepayment relating to a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in favor of the Company. See Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The increase in interest income and other, net from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances and higher yields achieved by switching a larger portion of the investments to longer duration portfolios as well as into taxable instruments. 29  Provision for Income Taxes 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 (In thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 102,453 17 % $ 87,821 85 % $ 47,555 Effective tax rate 22 % 22 % 14 % The effective tax rates in all years reflected the impact of foreign income (loss) at different statutory rates and tax credits earned in the United States. During fiscal 2006, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and its Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan to repatriate $500.0 million of permanently reinvested earnings from the Companys foreign subsidiaries. This plan qualifies for the 85% dividends received deduction provided for under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). These earnings were repatriated in March 2006. See Note 2 and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." When compared to fiscal 2005, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was relatively flat. There were, however, significant offsetting items during the period. The increase in tax was primarily attributable to the approval of the special one time AJCA dividend that was repatriated from the Companys foreign subsidiaries prior to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. This resulted in the recognition of approximately $24.9 million of federal and state tax expense. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the provision for income taxes was reduced by a net tax benefit of $8.9 million ($0.03 per share) for the correction of certain individually immaterial adjustments primarily related to prior periods. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for further discussion. Additionally, the Company recognized the benefit of deferred tax assets related to certain California state tax credits of $8.9 million that were previously subject to a valuation allowance. Management determined that it was more likely than not that the asset would be realized and, accordingly, released a substantial portion of the valuation allowance. Further, the Company released tax reserves of $9.4 million related to the favorable ruling by the U.S. Tax Court for Xilinx in its litigation with the IRS for fiscal 1996 to 1999. During fiscal 2005, the Company repatriated $450.0 million of earnings from its foreign operations, on which taxes were previously provided. This resulted in the utilization of significant amounts of net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, the Company recorded a one time benefit of $4.7 million for reversing previously provided taxes relating to an IRS audit. The Company was under examination by the IRS for its fiscal 1996 through 2001. All issues have been settled with the exception of issues related to Xilinx U.S.s cost sharing arrangement with Xilinx Ireland. On August 30, 2005, the U.S. Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The U.S. Tax Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options is to be included in the cost sharing agreement. Accordingly, there are no additional taxes, penalties or interest due for this issue. The decision documents are expected to be filed, jointly by the Company and the IRS, with the Tax Court. After the Tax Court enters the decision, the IRS will have 90 days within which to appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" and Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities and in UMC stock are available for future sale. 30 Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments at April 1, 2006 and April 2, 2005 totaled $1.6 billion for both periods. As of April 1, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $984.9 million and working capital of $1.3 billion. Cash provided by operations of $489.4 million for fiscal 2006 was $213.9 million higher than the $275.5 million generated during fiscal 2005. Cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for noncash related items, a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors, which were partially offset by increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as other assets. The increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as other assets were primarily related to the second $50.0 million advance wafer purchase payment paid to Toshiba in September 2005 and $17.8 million of investments in intellectual property and licenses. In October 2004, the Company entered into an advanced purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company would pay Toshiba a total of $100.0 million in two equal installments for advance payment of silicon wafers produced under the agreement. The entire advance payment of $100.0 million is being reduced by future wafer purchases from Toshiba and any unused portion is fully refundable in December 2006 if Toshiba is not able to maintain ongoing production and quality criteria or if future wafer purchases do not exceed the total amount advanced. The balance of the advance payment remaining was $72.3 million at April 1, 2006. Net cash provided by investing activities of $242.4 million during fiscal 2006 included net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale securities of $353.3 million, which was partially offset by $67.0 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, $19.5 million for the purchase of AccelChip and $24.4 million for other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $397.8 million in fiscal 2006 consisting of $401.6 million for the repurchase of common stock and $97.2 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $101.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments decreased 9% from $213.5 million at the end of fiscal 2005 to $194.2 million at the end of fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to strong collections during fiscal 2006 that were partially offset by increased shipments. The decrease was also partially attributable to the change in payment terms from 45 days to 30 days for some North American customers. Days sales outstanding decreased to 41 days at April 1, 2006 from 49 days at April 2, 2005. Inventories Inventories increased from $185.7 million at April 2, 2005 to $201.0 million at April 1, 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased inventory in our new products to support forecasted revenue growth. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were relatively flat at 145 days at April 1, 2006 compared to 146 days at April 2, 2005. We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand. Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2006, we invested $67.0 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $61.4 million in fiscal 2005. Primary investments in fiscal 2006 were for computer equipment, IT equipment, test 31 equipment and building improvements. We expect that property, plant and equipment expenditures will increase in the future due to the expansion of our regional headquarters in Singapore. Current Liabilities Current liabilities increased from $298.4 million at the end of fiscal 2005 to $345.0 million at the end of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors, accrued payroll and related liabilities and other accrued liabilities. The increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to higher inventory in the distributor channel as a result of overall increased sales levels. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased $55.4 million during fiscal 2006, principally as a result of $354.1 million in net income for fiscal 2006, the issuance of common shares and treasury stock under employee stock plans of $104.1 million, the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $40.6 million, $44.7 million for the reversal of reserves for cost sharing as a result of the U.S. Tax Court decision mentioned above, $17.2 million in unrealized gains on available for sale securities, net of deferred taxes, primarily from our investment in UMC stock and $853 thousand for noncash compensation expense and unrealized gains on hedging transactions. The increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $400.0 million, as adjusted for accrued and unsettled transactions, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $97.2 million, tax reconciliation and reclassification adjustments of $7.3 million and cumulative translation adjustment of $1.7 million. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments at April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004 totaled $1.6 billion for both periods. As of April 2, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $861.6 million and working capital of $1.2 billion. Cash provided by operations of $275.5 million for fiscal 2005 was $157.0 million lower than the $432.5 million generated during fiscal 2004. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for noncash related items and a decrease in accounts receivable which were partially offset by increases in inventories, deferred income taxes, an advance wafer purchase payment of $50.0 million to Toshiba and a decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors. Net cash used in investing activities of $45.1 million during fiscal 2005 included $61.4 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and $18.4 million for the acquisition of HDI, partially offset by $34.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities. Net cash used in financing activities was $118.3 million in fiscal 2005 consisting of $133.8 million for the repurchase of common stock and $69.6 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $85.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments decreased 14% from $249.0 million at the end of fiscal 2004 to $213.5 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily attributable to better linearity of shipments to distributors during the three months ended April 2, 2005 as compared to the three months ended April 3, 2004 and a decreased level of shipments. Days sales outstanding decreased from 66 days at April 3, 2004 to 49 days at April 2, 2005. Inventories Inventories increased from $102.5 million at April 3, 2004 to $185.7 million at April 2, 2005. The increase was due to an inventory build up from unusually low inventory levels in fiscal 2004 for an anticipated 32 growth in sales for the second half of calendar 2004 that did not materialize and the ramping of new products. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2005, we invested $61.4 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $41.0 million in fiscal 2004. Primary investments in fiscal 2005 were for computer equipment, IT equipment, test equipment and building improvements. Current Liabilities Current liabilities decreased from $381.1 million at the end of fiscal 2004 to $298.4 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decreases in deferred income on shipments to distributors, accounts payable and income taxes payable. The decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to lower inventory in the distributor channel. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased $190.4 million during fiscal 2005, principally as a result of $312.7 million in net income for the year ended April 2, 2005, the issuance of common shares and treasury stock under employee stock plans of $84.5 million, $504 thousand in amortization of deferred compensation related to the RocketChips acquisition, the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $51.9 million and cumulative translation adjustment of $897 thousand. The increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $134.6 million, as adjusted for accrued and unsettled transactions, the payment of our first full year of dividends to stockholders of $69.7 million and $55.8 million in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, net of deferred taxes, primarily from our investment in UMC stock. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at April 1, 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities at April 1, 2006. Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (In millions) Operating lease obligations(1) $ 32.7 $ 6.9 $ 10.7 $ 6.7 $ 8.4 New building commitment(2) 39.0 24.0 15.0 Inventory and other purchase obligations(3) 76.8 76.8 Electronic design automation software licenses(4) 15.6 9.0 6.6 Intellectual property license rights obligations(5) 20.0 20.0 Total $ 184.1 $ 116.7 $ 52.3 $ 6.7 $ 8.4 (1)We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under operating leases that expire at various dates through November 2035. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was approximately $6.5 million for fiscal 2006. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about operating leases. (2)In November 2005, Xilinx announced a $40.0 million investment in a new building in Singapore, the Companys Asia Pacific regional headquarters. As of April 1, 2006, approximately $39.0 million of our investment commitment remains outstanding. The project is expected to be completed in June 2007. (3)Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and 33 services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. (4)As of April 1, 2006, the Company has approximately $15.6 million of non cancelable operating lease obligations to providers of electronic design automation software expiring at various dates through July 2008. (5)In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company committed up to $20.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual property acquired. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R). This statement replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123(R) will require the Company to measure the cost of all employee stock based compensation awards that are expected to be exercised and which are granted after the effective date based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (generally over the vesting period of the award). In addition, the Company is required to record compensation expense (as previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. SFAS 123(R) will become effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will implement the standard for the fiscal year beginning April 2, 2006 using the modified prospective method. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method will have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the stock price. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about SFAS 123(R) and other recent accounting pronouncements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of April 1, 2006, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Summary of Liquidity and Capital Resources On April 25, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The dividend is payable on May 31, 2006 to stockholders of record on May 10, 2006. On April 20, 2005, our Board of Directors declared an increase in the dividend rate on our common stock from $0.05 to $0.07 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The dividend was paid on June 1, 2005 to stockholders of record on May 11, 2005. On July 20 and October 19, 2005 and January 18, 2006, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.07 per common share for the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 which were paid on September 7 and December 1, 2005 and March 1, 2006, respectively, to stockholders of record on August 17 and November 17, 2005 and February 8, 2006, respectively. For fiscal 2005, the Board of Directors declared four quarterly common stock dividends of $0.05 per share each for a total of $0.20 per share for the entire fiscal year. Our dividend policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs and other strategic investments. We anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A and below could affect our cash positions adversely. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business. 34  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.5 billion at April 1, 2006. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. The portfolio includes tax advantaged municipal bonds, taxable and tax advantaged auction rate securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, government agency bonds and U.S. Treasury securities. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market interest rates compared to interest rates at April 1, 2006 would not materially affect the fair value of our available for sale securities and the impact on our investment portfolio would have been less than $10.0 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained, are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. We will enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of April 1, 2006, we had approximately U.S. $12.8 million of outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against the Euro, approximately U.S. $4.1 million of outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against the Japanese Yen and approximately U.S. $15.9 million of outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against the Singapore dollar. The net unrealized gain or loss which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts was immaterial at April 1, 2006. The contracts expire at various dates between April 2006 and June 2007. Our investments in several wholly owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at each quarter end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. In addition, as our subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies, exchange rate fluctuations will occur. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 1, 2006 would have affected the value of our investments in foreign currency denominated subsidiaries by less than $12.0 million. Equity Security Price Risk Our investment in marketable equity securities at April 1, 2006 consists almost entirely of our investment in UMC, which consists of shares of common stock, the value of which is determined by the closing price on the Taiwan Stock Exchange as of the balance sheet date. This value is converted from New Taiwan dollars into U.S. dollars and included in our determination of the change in the fair value of our investment in UMC which is accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). The market value of our investment in UMC was approximately $276.5 million at April 1, 2006 as compared to our adjusted cost basis of approximately $239.0 million. The value of our investment in UMC would be materially impacted if there was a significant change in the market price of the UMC shares and or New Taiwan dollars. Excluding the effect of any changes in the New Taiwan dollar, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in UMCs stock price compared to the stock price at April 1, 2006 would have affected the value of our investment in UMC by less than $28.0 million. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information about our UMC investment. 35
