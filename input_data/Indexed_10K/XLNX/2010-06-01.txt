Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information about our revenues from our product families. 7 Table of Contents Research and Development Our research and development (RD) activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs, the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the design of logic IP cores, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and the lowering of PLD power consumption. As a result of our RD efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past several years including the Virtex 6 and Spartan 6 families. Additionally, we have made enhancements to our IP core offerings and introduced new versions of our ISE Design Suite. We extended our collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of 65 nm, 45 nm and 40 nm manufacturing technology and we were the first company in the PLD industry to ship 45 nm high volume FPGA devices. Our RD challenge is to continue to develop new products that create cost effective solutions for customers. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, our RD expenses were $369.5 million, $355.4 million and $358.1 million, respectively. We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success and we are committed to maintaining a significant level of RD investment. Sales and Distribution We sell our products to OEMs and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs or contract manufacturers. We use dedicated global sales and marketing organizations as well as independent sales representatives to generate sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often addressing those customers in defined territories. Distributors create demand within the balance of our customer base. Distributors also provide vendor managed inventory, value added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM customers. Whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, such as credit loss, inventory shrinkage and theft, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty liability. In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted the distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a subsequent change in list prices. Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributors end customers. Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. As of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, Avnet accounted for 83% and 81% of the Companys total accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 49%, 55% and 61% of the Companys worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also use other regional distributors throughout the world. We believe distributors provide a cost effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by ASICs, and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of business and distributor performance and financial condition. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we terminated our relationship with one of our North American based distributors. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for information about concentrations of credit risk and Note 17. Segment Information for information about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations. Backlog As of April 3, 2010, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $282.0 million, compared to $162.0 million as of March 28, 2009. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result, backlogs from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period. Wafer Fabrication As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs. Rather, we purchase wafers from multiple foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba), Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and He Jian Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. Currently, UMC manufactures the substantial majority of our wafers. In February 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) to be our foundry supplier at the 28 nm technology node. 8 Table of Contents Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by our periodic negotiations with the wafer foundries. Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of leading edge process technologies. Sort, Assembly and Test Wafers purchased are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors. Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are generally tested by Xilinx personnel at our Singapore facility or by independent test subcontractors. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our testing services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan, Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines and STATS ChipPAC Ltd. in Singapore. Quality Certification Xilinx has achieved quality management systems certification for ISO 9001:2000 for our facilities in San Jose, California; Dublin, Ireland; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore and Albuquerque, New Mexico. In addition, Xilinx achieved ISO 14001, TL 9000 and TS 16949 environmental and quality certifications in the San Jose, Dublin and Singapore locations, TL 9000 certifications in the Longmont and Albuquerque locations and TS 16949 certifications in the Albuquerque and Hyderabad, India locations. Patents and Licenses While our various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of April 3, 2010, we held more than 2,300 issued United States (U.S.) patents, which vary in duration, and over 650 pending U.S. patent applications relating to our proprietary technology. We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC architecture, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies relating to PLDs. We have licensed some parties to certain portions of our patent portfolio and obtained licenses to certain third party patents as well. We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented in IP cores or embedded in our PLDs, such as processors. Those licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell these PLDs to our customers. We also sublicense certain third party proprietary software and open source software, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of those software components is important to the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend. We maintain the Xilinx trade name as well as numerous trademarks and registered trademarks including Xilinx, Virtex, Spartan, ISE and associated logos. Maintaining these rights, and the goodwill associated with these trademarks and logos, is important to our business. We also have license rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and other trademark owners that are related to our products and business. We intend to protect our intellectual property vigorously. We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights (including, for example, patents, copyrights and trademarks) or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur, litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful. Employees As of April 3, 2010, we had 2,948 employees compared to 3,145 as of the end of the prior fiscal year. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations. 9 Table of Contents Executive Officers of the Registrant Certain information regarding the executive officers of Xilinx as of June 1, 2010 is set forth below: Name Age Position Moshe N.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to Note 17. Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This annual report includes trademarks and service marks of Xilinx and other companies that are unregistered and registered in the U. S. and other countries. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including: timely completion of new product designs; ability to generate new design opportunities or design wins; availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products; ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of 45 nm and smaller; achieving acceptable yields; ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors; ability to obtain advanced packaging; availability of supporting software design tools; utilization of predefined IP cores of logic; customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and market acceptance of our customers products. 11 Table of Contents Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations. Nearly all of our wafers were manufactured either in Taiwan, by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), or in Japan, by Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba). In addition, the wafers for our older products are manufactured in Japan by Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko) and the wafers for some of our newer products are manufactured in South Korea, by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer foundries, which usually result in short term agreements that do not provide for long term supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC, which supplies the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes. These attributes include an ability to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we experienced supply shortages due to the difficulties encountered by the foundries in rapidly increasing their production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an unexpected increase in demand. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we also experienced supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products and a surge in demand for semiconductors in general, which has led to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We have established other sources of wafer supply for many of our products in an effort to secure a continued supply of wafers. However, establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry relationships require the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If we do not manage these relationships effectively, it could adversely affect our results of operations. General economic conditions and the related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. During the past two years, global consumer confidence eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. These concerns slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in numerous countries, including many of those in North America, Europe and Asia. These economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010 due to reduced customer demand. While there have been recent improvements in global economic conditions and our results of operations improved during the second half of fiscal 2010, there is no guarantee that these improvements will continue in the future. If unpredictable economic conditions persist or worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result in production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by downturns in the industry, including the current downturn. Down cycles are generally characterized by price erosion and weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from economic conditions in the end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results. 12 Table of Contents The nature of our business makes our revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers designs, the design to volume production process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, we are dependent upon turns, orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write downs or failure to timely meet customer product demands. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide forward looking revenue and earnings guidance. If we are not able to successfully compete in our industry, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely affected. Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors, Altera, Lattice and Actel, from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs, from the ASSP market, and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include: product pricing; time to market; product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density; field upgradeability; adaptability of products to specific applications; ease of use and functionality of software design tools; availability and functionality of predefined IP cores of logic; inventory and supply chain management; access to leading edge process technology and assembly capacity; and ability to provide timely customer service and support. Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high volume, low cost and low power applications as well as high performance, high density applications. In addition, we anticipate continued price reductions proportionate with our ability to lower the cost for established products. However, we may not be successful in achieving these strategies. Other competitors include manufacturers of: high density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA type architectures; high volume and low cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; high speed, low density CPLDs; high performance DSP devices; products with embedded processors; products with embedded multi gigabit transceivers; and other new or emerging programmable logic products. Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in this segment. 13 Table of Contents We could also face competition from our licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to other companies with respect to certain of our older technology, and we may do so in the future. Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market products that may be competitive with some of our older products. Increased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues. If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, or market demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, our supply of wafers and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases and wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities and our resulting potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. Such increases in wafer prices or materials could adversely affect our gross margins and shortages of wafers and materials would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced revenue. We depend on distributors, primarily Avnet, to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 49% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2010, and as of April 3, 2010, Avnet accounted for 83% of our total accounts receivable. In addition, we are subject to concentrations of credit risk in our trade accounts receivable, which includes accounts of our distributors. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we terminated our relationship with one of our North American based distributors. As a result, we are increasingly dependent on our relationship with Avnet. Any adverse change to our relationship with Avnet or our remaining distributors could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to perform, our business and financial results would suffer. In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could result in the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance the purchase of our products, or cause distributors to delay payment of their obligations to us and increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors. We are dependent on independent subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services and unavailability or disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, any disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. A number of factors can impact our gross margins. A number of factors, including yield, wafer pricing, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and or market segment pricing strategies cause our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because the majority of our business is based on turns within the same quarter. Reductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins. The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins. 14 Table of Contents Because of our international business and operations, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions of the countries in which we operate and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse affect on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to our U.S. operations, we also have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, our regional headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and a research and development site in India. In connection with the restructuring we announced in April 2009, our international operations grew as we relocated certain operations and administrative functions outside the U.S. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. We derive over one half of our revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Japan. Past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues. While there have been signs of economic recovery in the U.S. and other markets, there can be no assurance that such improvement will continue or is sustainable. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movement of the Euro and Yen against the U.S. dollar had no material impact to our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency instability and volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers ability to repay existing obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our foreign currency denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore, because we are increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in worldwide economic environments occasioned, for example, by political instability, terrorist activity or U.S. or other military actions could adversely impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. We are subject to the risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely affect our business. In addition to international sales and support operations and development activities, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries and have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested by subcontractors located outside the U.S. All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including tax laws and regulations, trade barriers, economic sanctions, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies, foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and or operating results. Additional factors that could adversely affect us due to our international operations include rising oil prices and increased costs of natural resources. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers, end customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. Adverse change to the circumstances or conditions of our international business operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market values of our portfolio investments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our cash, short term and long term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit rating and financial market conditions. Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital markets experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair values of our debt securities is judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions. 15 Table of Contents Our failure to protect and defend our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete effectively. We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, violated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our IP through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against our indemnitees or us in the future. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims or other legal actions and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly or unauthorized access to our systems could result in business disruption. We rely in part on various information technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting, and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or enhance existing, operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. For example, we recently simplified our supply chain and were required to make certain changes to our IT systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption. We also may be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security breach or attack. We seek to detect and investigate any security incidents and prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. Our business could be significantly harmed and we could be subject to third party claims in the event of such a security breach. Earthquakes and other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. The independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. UMCs foundries in Taiwan and Toshibas and Seikos foundries in Japan as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past and some areas have been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Any catastrophic event in these locations will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing activities. This type of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or ship products, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations. Additionally, disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason, including other natural disasters such as typhoons, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our stock price could be adversely affected. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements and could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock price to drop. We compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel would harm us. We depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. From time to time we have effected restructurings which eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are discussed under Item 3. Legal Proceedings, included in Part I, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially and adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 16 Table of Contents Our products could have defects which could result in reduced revenues and claims against us. We develop complex and evolving products that include both hardware and software. Despite our testing efforts and those of our subcontractors, defects may be found in existing or new products. These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we have agreed to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event our hardware products experience epidemic failure. As a result, epidemic failure and other performance problems could result in claims against us, the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business. Our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses. In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. Product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. In preparing our financial statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn out to be erroneous. In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S., we must make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The most difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we make concern valuation of marketable and non marketable securities, revenue recognition, inventories, long lived assets, goodwill, taxes and stock based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. If these estimates or their related assumptions change, our operating results for the periods in which we revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially affected. Our failure to comply with the requirements of the International Traffic and Arms Regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Based on a recent jurisdictional ruling, certain Xilinx space grade FPGAs and related technologies are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. The ITAR governs the export and reexport of these FPGAs, the transfer of related technical data and the provision of defense services, as well as offshore production, test and assembly. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent ITAR licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and or operating results. Considerable amounts of our common shares are available for issuance under our equity incentive plans and convertible debentures, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the market price of our common shares. As of April 3, 2010, we had 2.00 billion authorized common shares, of which 273.5 million shares were outstanding. In addition, 54.7 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 22.6 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible debentures. The availability of substantial amounts of our common shares resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans or the conversion or repurchase of convertible debentures using common shares, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices, which include the administrative, sales, customer support, marketing, RD and manufacturing and testing groups, are located in San Jose, California. This main site consists of adjacent buildings providing 588,000 square feet of space, which we own. Excess space in this facility is leased to tenants under multi year lease agreements. We also own two parcels of land totaling approximately 121 acres in South San Jose near our corporate facility. At present, we do not have any plans to develop the land. We also have a 106,000 square foot leased facility in San Jose, which we do not occupy and is presently listed for subleasing. We own a 228,000 square foot facility in the metropolitan area of Dublin, Ireland, which serves as our regional headquarters in Europe. The Irish facility is primarily used for service and support for our customers in Europe, RD, marketing and IT support. We own a 222,000 square foot facility in Singapore, which serves as our Asia Pacific regional headquarters. We own the building but the land is subject to a 30 year lease expiring in November 2035. The Singapore facility is primarily used for manufacturing and testing of our products, service and support for our customers in Asia Pacific/Japan, coordination and management of certain third parties in our supply chain and RD. Excess space in the facility is leased to tenants under long term lease agreements. We own a 130,000 square foot facility in Longmont, Colorado. The Longmont facility serves as the primary location for our software efforts in the areas of RD, manufacturing and quality control. In addition, we own a 200,000 square foot facility and 40 acres of land adjacent to the Longmont facility for future expansion. The facility is partially leased to tenants under long term lease agreements and partially used by the Company. We own a 45,000 square foot facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which serves as the primary facility for the development efforts of our CoolRunner CPLD as well as IP cores. We lease office facilities for our engineering design centers in Portland, Oregon; Grenoble, France; Edinburgh, Scotland; Hyderabad, India and Toronto, Canada. We also lease sales offices in various locations throughout North America, which include the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Nashua, Ottawa, Raleigh, San Diego and Toronto as well as international sales offices located in the metropolitan areas of Beijing, Brussels, Helsinki, Hong Kong, London, Milan, Munich, Osaka, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Stockholm, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Tokyo. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Internal Revenue Service The IRS audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Companys tax returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS, all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below. On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement, and thus, the Company had no tax, interest, or penalties due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Appeals Court). The Company and the IRS presented oral arguments to a three judge panel of the Appeals Court on March 12, 2008. On May 27, 2009, the Company received a 2 1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Company did not agree with the Appeals Court decision and filed a motion for rehearing on August 12, 2009. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the Appeals Court affirmed the August 30, 2005 Tax Court decision in Xilinxs favor. In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. The Company began negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, the Company settled the proposed adjustment related to the acquired technology with no net change in tax liability. The Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for the remaining issues. 18 Table of Contents Patent Litigation On November 5, 2009, Agere Systems, Inc. (Agere), a wholly owned subsidiary of LSI Corporation (LSI), filed an action for patent infringement and breach of contract of a patent license agreement against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Agere Systems Inc. v. Xilinx, Inc., Index No. 603382/09, the New York State Action). This action was ultimately removed to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and consolidated with the Companys related actions against Agere and LSI. On April 2, 2010, Xilinx and LSI reached a resolution on the foregoing matters and all outstanding litigation between Xilinx and LSI and Agere have been dismissed with prejudice. This resolution did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. On December 28, 2007, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT) against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division (PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No. 2:07 CV 563). The lawsuit pertains to eleven different patents and PACT seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages, interest and attorneys fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to the Company is estimable at this time. Other Matters From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, we review the status of each matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we continue to reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report. 19 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol XLNX.

The following table sets forth the high and low closing sale prices, for the periods indicated, for our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market: Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 High Low High Low First Quarter $ 21.85 $ 18.38 $ 28.16 $ 22.96 Second Quarter 23.83 19.15 27.55 22.48 Third Quarter 25.36 21.55 23.45 14.61 Fourth Quarter 27.32 23.28 20.38 15.47 Dividends Declared Per Common Share The following table presents the quarterly dividends declared on our common stock for the periods indicated: Fiscal Fiscal 2010 2009 First Quarter $ 0.14 $ 0.14 Second Quarter 0.14 0.14 Third Quarter 0.16 0.14 Fourth Quarter 0.16 0.14 On April 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2010. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On February 25, 2008, we announced a repurchase program for up to $800.0 million of common stock. On November 6, 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment of this repurchase program to provide that the funds may also be used to repurchase our outstanding 3.125% junior subordinated convertible debentures (debentures). This repurchase program has no stated expiration date. The Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of its common stock in the open market for $150.0 million during fiscal 2010. Through April 3, 2010, the Company had used $424.3 million of the $800.0 million authorized for the repurchase of its outstanding common stock and debentures, leaving $375.7 million available for future purchases.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Cautionary Statement The statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this document. Often, forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words, such as may, will, could, should, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, continue, plan, intend, project and other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms. We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward looking statement provided in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for any reason. Nature of Operations We design, develop and market programmable platforms, including advanced ICs in the form of PLDs, software design tools and predefined system functions delivered as IP cores. In addition to our programmable platforms, we provide design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs by a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include: valuation of marketable and non marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long lived assets, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; and valuation and recognition of stock based compensation, which impacts gross margin, research and development (RD) expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Valuation of Marketable and Non marketable Securities Our short term and long term investments include marketable debt securities and non marketable equity securities. As of April 3, 2010, we had marketable debt securities with a fair value of $1.74 billion and non marketable equity securities in private companies of $17.7 million (adjusted cost). We determine the fair values for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard pricing services, data providers and other third party sources and by internally performing valuation analyses. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of the valuation methodologies. In determining if and when a decline in value below adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity securities is other than temporary, we evaluate on an ongoing basis the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying collateral and other key measures for our investments. We assess other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities in accordance with the latest guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). We recorded an other than temporary impairment for marketable debt securities and a marketable equity security in fiscal 2009. We did not record any other than temporary impairment for marketable debt or equity securities in fiscal 2010 or 2008. 23 Table of Contents Our investments in non marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of non marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in the investees industry, the investees product development status and subsequent rounds of financing and the related valuation and or our participation in such financings. We also assess the investees ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investees need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. The valuation methodology for determining the fair value of non marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss in the current periods operating results to the extent of the decline. We recorded other than temporary impairments for non marketable equity securities in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $3.8 million, 3.0 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors end customers. For fiscal 2010, approximately 69% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributors end customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from us. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms. As of April 3, 2010, we had $110.4 million of deferred revenue and $30.3 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $80.1 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. As of March 28, 2009, we had $90.4 million of deferred revenue and $28.0 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $62.4 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers. Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no significant formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers. Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 6% of net revenues for all of the periods presented. Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances. Valuation of Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first in, first out method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts, which are also consistent with our short term manufacturing plans. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 24 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. Long lived assets such as goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are considered non financial assets, and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment exist. The accounting and disclosure guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB became effective for these assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. Goodwill As required by the authoritative guidance for goodwill established by the FASB, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For purposes of impairment testing, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2010. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified. Accounting for Income Taxes Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities positions and our assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in periods when these changes occur. We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We perform a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions relating to accounting for income taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. See Note 16. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 25 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes model, also require the use of input assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk free rate of return. We use implied volatility based on traded options in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume of market activity of traded options, and determined there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of options granted by us, such as date of grant and the exercise price, and determined the input assumptions were comparable; and the length of term of traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two years and which was extrapolated to match the expected term of the employee options granted by us, and determined the length of the option term was reasonable. The expected life of options granted is based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all options outstanding. We will continue to review our input assumptions and make changes as deemed appropriate depending on new information that becomes available. Higher volatility and expected lives result in a proportional increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return do not have as significant an effect on the calculation of fair value. In addition, we developed an estimate of the number of stock based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate have an effect on reported stock based compensation, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. The impact of forfeiture true up and forfeiture rate estimates in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 reduced stock based compensation expense by $16.7 million, $15.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates. Results of Operations The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years indicated: 2010 2009(1) 2008(1) Net Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 36.6 36.7 37.3 Gross Margin 63.4 63.3 62.7 Operating Expenses: Research and development 20.2 19.5 19.4 Selling, general and administrative 17.9 18.8 19.9 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 0.1 0.3 0.4 Restructuring charges 1.6 1.2 0.0 Total operating expenses 39.8 39.8 39.7 Operating Income 23.6 23.5 23.0 Gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures 0.0 4.1 0.0 Impairment loss on investments (0.2 ) (3.0 ) (0.2 ) Interest and other income (expense), net (0.4 ) 0.5 2.7 Income Before Income Taxes 23.0 25.1 25.5 Provision for income taxes 3.5 5.3 5.4 Net Income 19.5 % 19.8 % 20.1 % (1) We adopted the authoritative guidance of accounting for convertible debentures beginning in fiscal 2010. Prior results have been retrospectively adjusted in accordance with such guidance (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). 26 Table of Contents Net Revenues (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Net revenues $ 1,833.6 0 % $ 1,825.2 (1 )% $ 1,841.4 Net revenues in fiscal 2010 were essentially flat with fiscal 2009. Revenues in the last two quarters of fiscal 2010 were substantially higher than revenues in the first two quarters of the year. The first two quarters of fiscal 2010 were adversely impacted by economic conditions, and were also substantially lower than the same periods of the prior fiscal year. New Product revenues increased considerably in fiscal 2010 but were offset by the declines in Mainstream, Base and Support products. The 1% decline in net revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was largely due to the recessionary environment we experienced during the fiscal year which impacted our sales across a broad base of end markets. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, total unit sales declined and average selling price per unit increased compared to the comparable prior year periods. See Net Revenues by Product and Net Revenues by End Markets below for more information on our product and end market categories. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented. Net Revenues by Product We sell our products to global manufacturers of electronic products in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical and audio, video and broadcast. The vast majority of our net revenues are generated by sales of our semiconductor products, but we also generate sales from support products. We classify our product offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. The composition of each product category is as follows: New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the Virtex 6, Virtex 5, Spartan 6, Spartan 3A and Spartan 3E product families. Mainstream Products include the Virtex 4, Spartan 3, Spartan II and CoolRunner II product families. Base Products consist of our older product families including the Virtex, Virtex E, Virtex II, Spartan, XC4000, CoolRunner and XC9500 products. Support Products include configuration products (PROMs), software, IP cores, customer training, design services and support. These product categories, except for Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the age of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on March 29, 2009, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2010. Amounts for the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the new categorization. New Products include our most recent product offerings and are typically designed into our customers latest generation of electronic systems. Mainstream Products are generally several years old and designed into customer programs that are currently shipping in full production. Base Products are older than Mainstream Products with demand generated generally by the oldest customer systems still in production. Support Products are generally products or services sold in conjunction with our semiconductor devices to aid customers in the design process. Net revenues by product categories for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % of % % of % % of (In millions) 2010 Total Change 2009 Total Change 2008 Total New Products $ 580.0 32 78 $ 325.9 18 134 $ 139.5 8 Mainstream Products 604.6 33 (9 ) 666.1 37 2 653.5 35 Base Products 559.1 30 (24 ) 735.2 40 (22 ) 938.7 51 Support Products 89.9 5 (8 ) 98.0 5 (11 ) 109.7 6 Total net revenues $ 1,833.6 100 0 $ 1,825.2 100 (1 ) $ 1,841.4 100 Net revenues from New Products increased significantly in fiscal 2010 due to continued strong market acceptance of these products, particularly our 65 nm Virtex 5 product family. Sales from Virtex 5 nearly doubled in fiscal 2010. In addition, design win activity is strong for our next generation product families which include our high end, 40 nm Virtex 6 field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and our high volume, 45 nm Spartan 6 FPGAs. We expect these New Product families to contribute significantly to the growth in New Product revenues over time. In fiscal 2009, Virtex 5 and Spartan 3E contributed to the majority of the revenue growth versus the comparable prior year period. Net revenues from Mainstream Products declined in fiscal 2010 due to lower demand associated with the weakened economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year. Net revenues from Mainstream Products increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased sales of our Virtex 4 product family. The decline in net revenues from Base Products in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was expected since these products are mature and approaching the end of life. Net revenues from Support Products decreased in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period due to a decline in revenues from both our PROMs and software products. Net revenues from Support Products decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a decline in sales from our PROM products. 27 Table of Contents Net Revenues by End Markets Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers primary markets. We classify our net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications, Industrial and Other, Consumer and Automotive, and Data Processing. The percentage change calculation in the table below represents the year to year dollar change in each end market. Net revenues by end markets for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % Change % Change (% of total net revenues) 2010 in Dollars 2009 in Dollars 2008 Communications 47 % 7 44 % 1 43 % Industrial and Other 31 (4 ) 32 1 32 Consumer and Automotive 15 (7 ) 16 (6 ) 17 Data Processing 7 (4 ) 8 (9 ) 8 Total net revenues 100 % 0 100 % (1 ) 100 % Net revenues from Communications, our largest end market, increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year periods due to higher sales from wireless communication applications. In fiscal 2010, the decrease in net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market from the comparable prior year period was primarily driven by weaker sales in industrial, scientific and medical applications as well as test and measurement applications during the first half of the fiscal year. Net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market increased slightly in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period due to strong sales growth from aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific and medical applications. However, this growth was offset considerably by weakness in test and measurement applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to decreased sales in audio, video and broadcast and consumer applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period due to weaker sales from audio, video and broadcast and automotive applications, which were partially offset by an increase in sales from consumer applications. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, net revenues from the Data Processing end market declined from the comparable prior year periods due to decreases in sales from computing and data processing applications. Net Revenues by Geography Geographic revenue information reflects the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased our products. This may differ from the geographic location of the end customers. Net revenues by geography for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % of % % of % % of (In millions) 2010 Total Change 2009 Total Change 2008 Total North America $ 628.5 34 0 $ 627.7 34 (13 ) $ 717.8 39 Asia Pacific 649.1 35 8 603.0 33 15 526.3 29 Europe 395.1 22 (4 ) 411.6 23 1 407.2 22 Japan 160.9 9 (12 ) 182.9 10 (4 ) 190.1 10 Total net revenues $ 1,833.6 100 0 $ 1,825.2 100 (1 ) $ 1,841.4 100 Net revenues in North America were essentially flat in fiscal 2010 compared with the prior year period. Lower sales from the Consumer and Automotive end market offset strength in each of the other end markets including Communications, Industrial and Other and Data Processing. Net revenues in North America decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower sales from the Communications end market. Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. The increases were driven by strength in the Communications end market, primarily from the deployment of next generation wireless applications in China. Net revenues in Europe decreased in fiscal 2010 due to weaker sales in most end market applications with the exception of wireless communication and automotive applications. Net revenues in Europe increased in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period primarily due to strength in wireless communication applications. Net revenues in Japan decreased in fiscal 2010 due to broad based weakness across all end market categories. The fiscal 2009 decline was due to broad based weakness across most end market categories with the exception of the Consumer and Automotive end market. 28 Table of Contents Gross Margin (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Gross margin $ 1,161.8 1 % $ 1,156.0 0 % $ 1,154.4 Percentage of net revenues 63.4 % 63.3 % 62.7 % Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2010 was essentially flat from the comparable prior year period as cost savings related to yield improvement and overall restructuring effort were offset by the strength of New Products. New Products generally have lower gross margins than Mainstream and Base Products as they are in the early stage of their product life cycle and have higher unit costs associated with relatively lower volumes and early manufacturing maturity. The increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period was driven primarily by product cost reductions, higher average selling prices per unit and improved operational efficiency. Gross margin may be affected in the future by product mix shifts, competitive pricing pressure, manufacturing yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these factors by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving manufacturing efficiencies. Sales of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer products. Research and Development (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Research and development $ 369.5 4 % $ 355.4 (1 )% $ 358.1 Percentage of net revenues 20 % 19 % 19 % RD spending increased $14.1 million or 4% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to increased mask and wafer spending in fiscal 2010 associated with the introduction of the Virtex 6 and Spartan 6 product families. RD spending decreased $2.7 million or 1% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was attributable to lower mask and wafer spending and reduced stock based compensation expense, which was partially offset by increased outside services to support our investments in new product development. We plan to continue to selectively invest in RD efforts in areas such as new products and more advanced process development, IP cores and the development of new design and layout software. We will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas. Selling, General and Administrative (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Selling, general and administrative $ 327.6 (5 )% $ 343.8 (6 )% $ 365.3 Percentage of net revenues 18 % 19 % 20 % SGA expenses decreased $16.2 million or 5% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of restructuring measures taken during fiscal 2010, partially offset by higher litigation related expenses (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). SGA expenses decreased $21.5 million or 6% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of a functional reorganization announced during fiscal 2009, lower sales commissions and lower stock based compensation expense, which was partially offset by higher litigation costs. 29 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles $ 2.5 (53 )% $ 5.3 (22 )% $ 6.8 Amortization expense was related to the intangible assets acquired from prior acquisitions. Amortization expense for these intangible assets decreased for fiscal 2010 from the same period last year, due to the complete amortization of all intangible assets in fiscal 2010. Amortization expense for these intangible assets decreased for fiscal 2009 from the same period last year, due to the complete amortization of certain intangible assets in fiscal 2009. Restructuring Charges During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we announced restructuring measures designed to drive structural operating efficiencies across the Company. We completed this restructuring plan by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and reduced our global workforce by approximately 200 positions, or about 6%. These employee terminations impacted various geographies and functions worldwide. We recorded total restructuring charges of $30.1 million in fiscal 2010, primarily related to severance costs and benefits expenses. The following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity for fiscal 2010: Employee Facility severance related and (In millions) and benefits other costs Total Balance as of March 28, 2009 $ $ 0.7 $ 0.7 Restructuring charges 28.6 1.5 30.1 Cash payments (25.7 ) (2.1 ) (27.8 ) Non cash settlements (1.0 ) (1.0 ) Balance as of April 3, 2010 $ 1.9 $ 0.1 $ 2.0 These fiscal 2010 charges above, as well as fiscal 2009 charges included in the table below, have been shown separately as restructuring charges on the consolidated statements of income. The remaining accrual as of April 3, 2010 primarily relates to severance costs and benefits that are expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We estimate that severance costs and benefits expenses incurred in the fiscal 2010 restructuring will result in gross annual cash savings relating to employee compensation of approximately $23.0 million before taxes. We began realizing cash savings associated with the restructuring, primarily within the SGA and RD expense categories, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but we do not expect to fully realize the cash savings benefit until fiscal 2011. There can be no assurance that these expected future savings will be completely realized as they may be partially offset by increases in other expenses. In addition, we estimate cumulative stock based compensation expense savings of approximately $6.6 million through fiscal 2013 as a result of the fiscal 2010 restructuring. The vast majority of the stock based compensation expense savings already occurred in fiscal 2010. Future stock based compensation expense may increase depending on other factors, primarily the number of shares to be granted, fair value of the future stock awards under equity incentive plans (which are primarily impacted by our then market price of the common stock and stock price volatility) and the impact of future award forfeitures. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced a functional reorganization pursuant to which we eliminated 249 positions, or approximately 7% of our global workforce. These employee terminations occurred across various geographies and functions worldwide. The reorganization plan was completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We recorded total restructuring charges of $22.0 million in connection with the reorganization in fiscal 2009. These charges consisted of $20.5 million of severance costs and benefits expenses and $1.5 million of facility related costs. The following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity for fiscal 2009: Employee Facility severance and related (In millions) benefits costs Total Balance as of March 29, 2008 $ $ $ Restructuring charges 20.5 1.5 22.0 Cash payments (20.0 ) (0.6 ) (20.6 ) Non cash settlements (0.5 ) (0.2 ) (0.7 ) Balance as of March 28, 2009 $ $ 0.7 $ 0.7 30 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Stock based compensation included in: Cost of revenues $ 5.2 (11 )% $ 5.8 (24 )% $ 7.6 Research and development 25.8 3 % 25.0 (20 )% 31.4 Selling, general and administrative 24.6 7 % 23.1 (16 )% 27.4 Restructuring charges 0.9 68 % 0.6 $ 56.5 4 % $ 54.5 (18 )% $ 66.4 The $2.0 million increase in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2010 as compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in the number of shares granted, which was partly offset by declining weighted average fair values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal 2010 restructuring. The $11.9 million decrease in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period last year was due to a decrease in the number of shares granted, declining weighted average fair values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal 2009 restructuring. Gain on Early Extinguishment of Convertible Debentures During fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of our debentures and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $75.0 million, net of the write off of the pro rata portions of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $41.5 million and unamortized derivative valuation of $736 thousand. Accrued interest paid at the time of repurchases totaled $2.4 million. Beginning in fiscal 2010, we retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for convertible debentures issued by the FASB. The authoritative guidance specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of such instruments in a manner that reflects the borrowing rate for a similar non convertible debt. See Adoption of New Accounting Standard for Convertible Debentures included in Note 2. Basis of Presentation to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part 1. Financial Information, for further information relating to the adoption. Impairment Loss on Investments (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Impairment loss on investments $ 3.8 (93 )% $ 54.1 1,799 % $ 2.9 Percentage of net revenues 0 % 3 % 0 % We recorded an impairment loss on investments in non marketable equity securities of $3.8 million and $2.9 million for fiscal 2010 and 2008, respectively, due to the weak financial condition of certain investees. We recognized impairment losses on investments of $54.1 million during fiscal 2009, which consisted of $51.1 million impairment losses related to marketable debt and equity securities and $3.0 million impairment losses in non marketable equity securities. Of the $54.1 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2009, $38.0 million was related to senior class asset backed securities where the issuer went into receivership. The receiver subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a provision of a legal document governing the issuers securities. As a result of the outcome of the judicial determination, the receiver immediately liquidated the substantial majority of the issuers assets, and in accordance with the court order, the proceeds were used to repay short term liabilities in the order in which they fell due. In December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuers creditors the outcome of the judicial determination and that the issuers liabilities substantially exceeded its assets. As a result, the receiver estimated that the issuer would not be able to pay any liabilities falling due after October 2008 regardless of the seniority or status of the securities. Based on these developments, we concluded that it was not likely that we would recover the balance of our investment. This decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and, therefore, we recognized an impairment loss of $38.0 million on these securities during fiscal 2009. In October 2009, a higher court reversed the initial judicial interpretation and determined that the proceeds should be used to repay short term liabilities on a pari passu basis. Given the significant liabilities of the issuer, it is uncertain whether we will recover any of our original investment. We have not recognized any amount that may be due back to us. We also recognized an additional impairment loss of $10.0 million on marketable debt securities in our investment portfolio during fiscal 2009, $9.0 million of which was due to the bankruptcy filing by one of the issuers of the marketable debt securities. In addition to the aforementioned amounts, we recorded $3.1 million of impairment loss in marketable equity securities investment during fiscal 2009 as a result of the continued decline in its market value, which led us to believe that the decline in the market value was other than temporary. Furthermore, during the same period, we recorded $3.0 million of write down of our investment in non marketable equity securities in private companies, which was recorded due primarily to the weak financial condition of certain investees. 31 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net (In millions) 2010 Change 2009* Change 2008* Interest and other income (expense), net $ (6.6 ) (187 )% $ 7.6 (84 )% $ 48.1 Percentage of net revenues (0 )% 0 % 3 % * As adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2010 over the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates earned on the investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield on our investments decreased by over 2.5 percentage points year over year. The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2009 over the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates and a smaller investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield on our investments decreased by approximately 2.0 percentage points year over year. Interest expense also decreased in fiscal 2009 and further in 2010 due to the fact that we repurchased our debentures in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 12. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Provision for Income Taxes (In millions) 2010 Change 2009* Change 2008* Provision for income taxes $ 64.3 (33 )% $ 96.3 (4 )% $ 100.2 Percentage of net revenues 4 % 5 % 5 % Effective tax rate 15 % 21 % 21 % * As adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The effective tax rates in all years reflected the favorable impact of foreign income at statutory rates less than the U.S. rate and tax credits earned. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, when compared with fiscal 2009, was due to an increase in the amount permanently reinvested outside the U. S. in fiscal 2010 for which no U.S. taxes have been provided, thereby reducing the rates for the period, compounded by an increase in the fiscal 2009 rate for the gain on early extinguishment of debentures taxable at U.S. tax rates. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was flat when compared with fiscal 2008, as the recognized gain on the early extinguishment of debentures was offset by the benefit of retroactive extension of the research credit in fiscal 2009. The IRS examined our tax returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS, all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below. On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with us that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement. Accordingly, there were no additional taxes, penalties or interest due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the Appeals Court. On May 27, 2009, we received a 2 1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that we should include stock option amounts in our cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the Appeals Court, in a 2 1 majority opinion, affirmed the Tax Court decision in Xilinxs favor. In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. We began negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, we settled the proposed adjustment related to acquired technology with no net change in tax liability. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings included in Part I and Note 16. Income Taxes and Note 18. Litigation Settlements and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are available for future sale. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. As of April 3, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.39 billion and working capital of $1.55 billion. Cash provided by operations of $554.3 million for fiscal 2010 was $111.8 million higher than the $442.5 million generated during fiscal 2009. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non cash related items, increases in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and deferred income on shipment to distributors, which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, other assets, inventories and prepaid and other current assets as well as a decrease in income taxes payable. Net cash used in investing activities was $336.7 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $274.5 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $306.3 million of net purchases of available for sale securities and $28.2 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion below) and $2.3 million of other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $252.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $518.1 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $150.0 million for the repurchase of common stock, $165.6 million for dividend payments to stockholders and $1.3 million for reduction of tax benefits from stock based compensation. These items were partially offset by $64.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments increased by 21% from $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $262.7 million at the end of fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding increased to 53 days as of April 3, 2010 from 43 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily attributable to increase in net shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Inventories Inventories increased from $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009 to $130.6 million as of April 3, 2010. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel increased to 89 days as of April 3, 2010, compared to 80 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily due to higher inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of the higher anticipated demand. We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand. Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2010, we invested $28.2 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $39.1 million in fiscal 2009. Primary investments in fiscal 2010 were for software, testers, handlers, computer and other equipment. Property, plant and equipment expenditures could increase in the near future due to investment in infrastructure and manufacturing related equipment. Current Liabilities Current liabilities increased from $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $357.2 million at the end of fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities from variable spending driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same prior year period, and an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors. The increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to an increase in distributor inventories as of April 3, 2010 compared to the prior year. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased $171.7 million during fiscal 2010, from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009 to $2.12 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in stockholders equity was attributable to total comprehensive income of $375.1 million (which included net income of $357.5 million) for fiscal 2010, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $60.1 million and stock based compensation related amounts totaling $52.1 million (net of the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises). The increases were partially offset by the payment of dividends to stockholders of $165.6 million and the repurchase of common stock of $150.0 million. 33 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008 totaled $1.67 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively. As of March 28, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.32 billion and working capital of $1.52 billion. Cash provided by operations of $442.5 million for fiscal 2009 was $138.5 million lower than the $581.0 million generated during fiscal 2008. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non cash related items, an increase in deferred income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable, which were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors. Net cash provided by investing activities was $274.5 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to $192.0 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of $314.4 million of net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale securities. These items were partially offset by $39.1 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion below) and $793 thousand of other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $518.1 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to $541.9 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of $193.2 million for the repurchase of debentures, $275.0 million for the repurchase of common stock and $154.5 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $99.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $4.8 million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments decreased 13% from $249.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009. Days sales outstanding decreased to 43 days as of March 28, 2009 from 49 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease in net shipments and weaker linearity of shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Inventories Inventories decreased from $130.3 million as of March 29, 2008 to $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel decreased to 80 days as of March 28, 2009, compared to 94 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily due to lower inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of declining revenues due to lower anticipated demand and more effective inventory management processes. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2009, we invested $39.1 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $45.6 million in fiscal 2008. Primary investments in fiscal 2009 were for building improvements, test equipment, computer equipment and software. Current Liabilities Current liabilities decreased from $340.7 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in income taxes payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors. The decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to a decrease in distributor inventories as of March 28, 2009 compared to the prior year. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity decreased $20.4 million during fiscal 2009, from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2008 to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009. The decrease in stockholders equity was attributable to the repurchase of common stock of $275.0 million, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $154.5 million, an early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $72.6 million, an adjustment to the cumulative effect of adopting FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions of $10.1 million, unrealized losses on available for sale securities, net of deferred tax benefits, of $14.9 million, cumulative translation adjustment of $7.7 million and unrealized hedging transaction losses totaling $2.0 million. The decreases were partially offset by net income of $361.7 million for fiscal 2009, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $96.4 million, stock based compensation related amounts totaling $54.1 million and the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $4.2 million. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $250.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in April 2007. We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility. We also have a shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt, equity and other securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources. We used $150.0 million of cash to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2010 compared with $275.0 million used to repurchase 10.8 million shares in fiscal 2009. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million of cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of our debentures resulting in a net gain on early extinguishment of debentures of $75.0 million. During fiscal 2010, we paid $165.6 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.60 per common share. During fiscal 2009, we paid $154.5 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.56 per common share. In addition, on April 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2010. Our common stock and debentures repurchase program and dividend policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to RD, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, principal and interest payments on our debentures and other strategic investments. The global credit crisis has imposed exceptional levels of volatility and disruption in the capital markets, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and increased counterparty risk. Nevertheless, we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A included in Part I and below could affect our cash positions adversely. In addition, certain types of investments such as auction rate securities may present risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns. In the event that our investments in auction rate securities become illiquid, we do not expect this will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources or results of operations. As of April 3, 2010, marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were comprised of $61.6 million of student loan auction rate securities. The amount of assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as a percentage of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value was less than 4% as of April 3, 2010. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. During fiscal 2010, we sold $20.0 million notional value of senior class asset backed securities and realized a $1.0 million loss. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, $20.0 million notional value of senior class asset backed securities that were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs matured at par value. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of April 3, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities as of April 3, 2010. Payments Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 18.0 $ 7.9 $ 5.7 $ 2.8 $ 1.6 Inventory and other purchase obligations (2) 129.5 129.5 Electronic design automation software licenses (3) 10.0 10.0 Intellectual property license rights obligations (4) 5.0 5.0 3.125% convertible debentures principal and interest (5) 1,271.5 21.6 43.1 43.1 1,163.7 Total $ 1,434.0 $ 169.0 $ 48.8 $ 45.9 $ 1,170.3 (1) We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through November 2035. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was approximately $5.3 million for fiscal 2010. See Note 10. Commitments to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about operating leases. 35 Table of Contents (2) Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. (3) As of April 3, 2010, we had $10.0 million of non cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software maintenance expiring at various dates through September 2011. (4) We committed up to $5.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property until July 2023. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual property acquired. (5) In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of debentures due March 15, 2037. As a result of the repurchases in fiscal 2009, the remaining outstanding principal amount of the debentures as of April 3, 2010 was $689.6 million. The debentures require payment of interest at an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2007. For purposes of this table we have assumed the principal of our debentures will be paid on March 15, 2037. See Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about our debentures. As of April 3, 2010, $56.2 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were classified as long term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of April 3, 2010, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of April 3, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for information about recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.74 billion as of April 3, 2010. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio includes municipal bonds, floating rate notes, mortgage backed securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, student loan auction rate securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuers credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 100 basis point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than $10.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Credit Market Risk Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital markets experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may incur additional other than temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate. See Note 4. Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about our investments. 36 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, we had the following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts: April 3, March 28, (In thousands and U.S. dollars) 2010 2009 Euro $ 21,190 $ 51,072 Singapore dollar 58,420 30,123 Japanese Yen 12,268 12,563 British Pound 4,889 6,408 $ 96,767 $ 100,166 As part of our strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we employ a hedging program with a five quarter forward outlook for major foreign currency denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward currency exchange contracts expire at various dates between April 2010 and April 2011. The net unrealized gain or loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, was immaterial as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009. Our investments in several of our wholly owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Other monetary foreign denominated assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with gains and losses on revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the annualized foreign currency denominated operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by less than $8.0 million for each year. In addition, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the value of foreign currency denominated cash and investments by less than $6.0 million as of each date. 37 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and to Note 17. Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This annual report includes trademarks and service marks of Xilinx and other companies that are unregistered and registered in the U. S. and other countries. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Companys management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including: timely completion of new product designs; ability to generate new design opportunities or design wins; availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new products; ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of 45 nm and smaller; achieving acceptable yields; ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors; ability to obtain advanced packaging; availability of supporting software design tools; utilization of predefined IP cores of logic; customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and market acceptance of our customers products. 11 Table of Contents Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations. Nearly all of our wafers were manufactured either in Taiwan, by United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), or in Japan, by Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba). In addition, the wafers for our older products are manufactured in Japan by Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko) and the wafers for some of our newer products are manufactured in South Korea, by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer foundries, which usually result in short term agreements that do not provide for long term supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC, which supplies the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes. These attributes include an ability to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we experienced supply shortages due to the difficulties encountered by the foundries in rapidly increasing their production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an unexpected increase in demand. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we also experienced supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products and a surge in demand for semiconductors in general, which has led to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We have established other sources of wafer supply for many of our products in an effort to secure a continued supply of wafers. However, establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry relationships require the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If we do not manage these relationships effectively, it could adversely affect our results of operations. General economic conditions and the related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. During the past two years, global consumer confidence eroded amidst concerns over declining asset values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. These concerns slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in numerous countries, including many of those in North America, Europe and Asia. These economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010 due to reduced customer demand. While there have been recent improvements in global economic conditions and our results of operations improved during the second half of fiscal 2010, there is no guarantee that these improvements will continue in the future. If unpredictable economic conditions persist or worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result in production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn could adversely affect our operating results. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by downturns in the industry, including the current downturn. Down cycles are generally characterized by price erosion and weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from economic conditions in the end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by our customers can result, and in the past has resulted in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results. 12 Table of Contents The nature of our business makes our revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon our products being designed into our end customers products and those products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers designs, the design to volume production process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, we are dependent upon turns, orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write downs or failure to timely meet customer product demands. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide forward looking revenue and earnings guidance. If we are not able to successfully compete in our industry, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely affected. Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors, Altera, Lattice and Actel, from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs, from the ASSP market, and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include: product pricing; time to market; product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density; field upgradeability; adaptability of products to specific applications; ease of use and functionality of software design tools; availability and functionality of predefined IP cores of logic; inventory and supply chain management; access to leading edge process technology and assembly capacity; and ability to provide timely customer service and support. Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high volume, low cost and low power applications as well as high performance, high density applications. In addition, we anticipate continued price reductions proportionate with our ability to lower the cost for established products. However, we may not be successful in achieving these strategies. Other competitors include manufacturers of: high density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA type architectures; high volume and low cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs; ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; high speed, low density CPLDs; high performance DSP devices; products with embedded processors; products with embedded multi gigabit transceivers; and other new or emerging programmable logic products. Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in this segment. 13 Table of Contents We could also face competition from our licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to other companies with respect to certain of our older technology, and we may do so in the future. Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market products that may be competitive with some of our older products. Increased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues. If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, or market demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, our supply of wafers and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases and wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities and our resulting potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. Such increases in wafer prices or materials could adversely affect our gross margins and shortages of wafers and materials would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced revenue. We depend on distributors, primarily Avnet, to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 49% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2010, and as of April 3, 2010, Avnet accounted for 83% of our total accounts receivable. In addition, we are subject to concentrations of credit risk in our trade accounts receivable, which includes accounts of our distributors. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we terminated our relationship with one of our North American based distributors. As a result, we are increasingly dependent on our relationship with Avnet. Any adverse change to our relationship with Avnet or our remaining distributors could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to perform, our business and financial results would suffer. In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could result in the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance the purchase of our products, or cause distributors to delay payment of their obligations to us and increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors. We are dependent on independent subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services and unavailability or disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, any disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. A number of factors can impact our gross margins. A number of factors, including yield, wafer pricing, product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and or market segment pricing strategies cause our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because the majority of our business is based on turns within the same quarter. Reductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins. The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins. 14 Table of Contents Because of our international business and operations, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions of the countries in which we operate and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse affect on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to our U.S. operations, we also have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, our regional headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and a research and development site in India. In connection with the restructuring we announced in April 2009, our international operations grew as we relocated certain operations and administrative functions outside the U.S. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. We derive over one half of our revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Japan. Past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues. While there have been signs of economic recovery in the U.S. and other markets, there can be no assurance that such improvement will continue or is sustainable. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movement of the Euro and Yen against the U.S. dollar had no material impact to our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency instability and volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers ability to repay existing obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our foreign currency denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore, because we are increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in worldwide economic environments occasioned, for example, by political instability, terrorist activity or U.S. or other military actions could adversely impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. We are subject to the risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely affect our business. In addition to international sales and support operations and development activities, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries and have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested by subcontractors located outside the U.S. All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations, including tax laws and regulations, trade barriers, economic sanctions, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies, foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and or operating results. Additional factors that could adversely affect us due to our international operations include rising oil prices and increased costs of natural resources. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers, end customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. Adverse change to the circumstances or conditions of our international business operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market values of our portfolio investments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our cash, short term and long term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit rating and financial market conditions. Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital markets experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair values of our debt securities is judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions. 15 Table of Contents Our failure to protect and defend our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete effectively. We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, violated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our IP through electronic or other means or assert infringement claims against our indemnitees or us in the future. Such assertions by third parties may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims or other legal actions and we may not prevail in such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly or unauthorized access to our systems could result in business disruption. We rely in part on various information technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting, and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or enhance existing, operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. For example, we recently simplified our supply chain and were required to make certain changes to our IT systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption. We also may be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security breach or attack. We seek to detect and investigate any security incidents and prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. Our business could be significantly harmed and we could be subject to third party claims in the event of such a security breach. Earthquakes and other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. The independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters. UMCs foundries in Taiwan and Toshibas and Seikos foundries in Japan as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past and some areas have been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Any catastrophic event in these locations will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing activities. This type of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or ship products, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations. Additionally, disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason, including other natural disasters such as typhoons, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our stock price could be adversely affected. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements and could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock price to drop. We compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to attract, such personnel would harm us. We depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers. Competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing qualified personnel. From time to time we have effected restructurings which eliminate a number of positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified personnel in the future. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are discussed under Item 3. Legal Proceedings, included in Part I, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would materially and adversely affect a portion of our business and might materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 16 Table of Contents Our products could have defects which could result in reduced revenues and claims against us. We develop complex and evolving products that include both hardware and software. Despite our testing efforts and those of our subcontractors, defects may be found in existing or new products. These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we have agreed to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event our hardware products experience epidemic failure. As a result, epidemic failure and other performance problems could result in claims against us, the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business. Our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses. In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. Product liability risks are particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. In preparing our financial statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn out to be erroneous. In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U. S., we must make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The most difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we make concern valuation of marketable and non marketable securities, revenue recognition, inventories, long lived assets, goodwill, taxes and stock based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. If these estimates or their related assumptions change, our operating results for the periods in which we revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially affected. Our failure to comply with the requirements of the International Traffic and Arms Regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Based on a recent jurisdictional ruling, certain Xilinx space grade FPGAs and related technologies are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. The ITAR governs the export and reexport of these FPGAs, the transfer of related technical data and the provision of defense services, as well as offshore production, test and assembly. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent ITAR licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and or operating results. Considerable amounts of our common shares are available for issuance under our equity incentive plans and convertible debentures, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the market price of our common shares. As of April 3, 2010, we had 2.00 billion authorized common shares, of which 273.5 million shares were outstanding. In addition, 54.7 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 22.6 million shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible debentures. The availability of substantial amounts of our common shares resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans or the conversion or repurchase of convertible debentures using common shares, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices, which include the administrative, sales, customer support, marketing, RD and manufacturing and testing groups, are located in San Jose, California. This main site consists of adjacent buildings providing 588,000 square feet of space, which we own. Excess space in this facility is leased to tenants under multi year lease agreements. We also own two parcels of land totaling approximately 121 acres in South San Jose near our corporate facility. At present, we do not have any plans to develop the land. We also have a 106,000 square foot leased facility in San Jose, which we do not occupy and is presently listed for subleasing. We own a 228,000 square foot facility in the metropolitan area of Dublin, Ireland, which serves as our regional headquarters in Europe. The Irish facility is primarily used for service and support for our customers in Europe, RD, marketing and IT support. We own a 222,000 square foot facility in Singapore, which serves as our Asia Pacific regional headquarters. We own the building but the land is subject to a 30 year lease expiring in November 2035. The Singapore facility is primarily used for manufacturing and testing of our products, service and support for our customers in Asia Pacific/Japan, coordination and management of certain third parties in our supply chain and RD. Excess space in the facility is leased to tenants under long term lease agreements. We own a 130,000 square foot facility in Longmont, Colorado. The Longmont facility serves as the primary location for our software efforts in the areas of RD, manufacturing and quality control. In addition, we own a 200,000 square foot facility and 40 acres of land adjacent to the Longmont facility for future expansion. The facility is partially leased to tenants under long term lease agreements and partially used by the Company. We own a 45,000 square foot facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which serves as the primary facility for the development efforts of our CoolRunner CPLD as well as IP cores. We lease office facilities for our engineering design centers in Portland, Oregon; Grenoble, France; Edinburgh, Scotland; Hyderabad, India and Toronto, Canada. We also lease sales offices in various locations throughout North America, which include the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Nashua, Ottawa, Raleigh, San Diego and Toronto as well as international sales offices located in the metropolitan areas of Beijing, Brussels, Helsinki, Hong Kong, London, Milan, Munich, Osaka, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Stockholm, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Tokyo. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Internal Revenue Service The IRS audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Companys tax returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS, all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below. On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement, and thus, the Company had no tax, interest, or penalties due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Appeals Court). The Company and the IRS presented oral arguments to a three judge panel of the Appeals Court on March 12, 2008. On May 27, 2009, the Company received a 2 1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Company did not agree with the Appeals Court decision and filed a motion for rehearing on August 12, 2009. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the Appeals Court affirmed the August 30, 2005 Tax Court decision in Xilinxs favor. In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. The Company began negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, the Company settled the proposed adjustment related to the acquired technology with no net change in tax liability. The Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for the remaining issues. 18 Table of Contents Patent Litigation On November 5, 2009, Agere Systems, Inc. (Agere), a wholly owned subsidiary of LSI Corporation (LSI), filed an action for patent infringement and breach of contract of a patent license agreement against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Agere Systems Inc. v. Xilinx, Inc., Index No. 603382/09, the New York State Action). This action was ultimately removed to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and consolidated with the Companys related actions against Agere and LSI. On April 2, 2010, Xilinx and LSI reached a resolution on the foregoing matters and all outstanding litigation between Xilinx and LSI and Agere have been dismissed with prejudice. This resolution did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. On December 28, 2007, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT) against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division (PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No. 2:07 CV 563). The lawsuit pertains to eleven different patents and PACT seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages, interest and attorneys fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to the Company is estimable at this time. Other Matters From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, we review the status of each matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we continue to reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report. 19 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol XLNX.

The following table sets forth the high and low closing sale prices, for the periods indicated, for our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market: Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 High Low High Low First Quarter $ 21.85 $ 18.38 $ 28.16 $ 22.96 Second Quarter 23.83 19.15 27.55 22.48 Third Quarter 25.36 21.55 23.45 14.61 Fourth Quarter 27.32 23.28 20.38 15.47 Dividends Declared Per Common Share The following table presents the quarterly dividends declared on our common stock for the periods indicated: Fiscal Fiscal 2010 2009 First Quarter $ 0.14 $ 0.14 Second Quarter 0.14 0.14 Third Quarter 0.16 0.14 Fourth Quarter 0.16 0.14 On April 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2010. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities On February 25, 2008, we announced a repurchase program for up to $800.0 million of common stock. On November 6, 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment of this repurchase program to provide that the funds may also be used to repurchase our outstanding 3.125% junior subordinated convertible debentures (debentures). This repurchase program has no stated expiration date. The Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of its common stock in the open market for $150.0 million during fiscal 2010. Through April 3, 2010, the Company had used $424.3 million of the $800.0 million authorized for the repurchase of its outstanding common stock and debentures, leaving $375.7 million available for future purchases.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Cautionary Statement The statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this document. Often, forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words, such as may, will, could, should, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, continue, plan, intend, project and other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms. We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward looking statement provided in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for any reason. Nature of Operations We design, develop and market programmable platforms, including advanced ICs in the form of PLDs, software design tools and predefined system functions delivered as IP cores. In addition to our programmable platforms, we provide design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs by a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include: valuation of marketable and non marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long lived assets, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; and valuation and recognition of stock based compensation, which impacts gross margin, research and development (RD) expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Valuation of Marketable and Non marketable Securities Our short term and long term investments include marketable debt securities and non marketable equity securities. As of April 3, 2010, we had marketable debt securities with a fair value of $1.74 billion and non marketable equity securities in private companies of $17.7 million (adjusted cost). We determine the fair values for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard pricing services, data providers and other third party sources and by internally performing valuation analyses. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of the valuation methodologies. In determining if and when a decline in value below adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity securities is other than temporary, we evaluate on an ongoing basis the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying collateral and other key measures for our investments. We assess other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities in accordance with the latest guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). We recorded an other than temporary impairment for marketable debt securities and a marketable equity security in fiscal 2009. We did not record any other than temporary impairment for marketable debt or equity securities in fiscal 2010 or 2008. 23 Table of Contents Our investments in non marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of non marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in the investees industry, the investees product development status and subsequent rounds of financing and the related valuation and or our participation in such financings. We also assess the investees ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investees need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. The valuation methodology for determining the fair value of non marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss in the current periods operating results to the extent of the decline. We recorded other than temporary impairments for non marketable equity securities in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $3.8 million, 3.0 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors end customers. For fiscal 2010, approximately 69% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributors end customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from us. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms. As of April 3, 2010, we had $110.4 million of deferred revenue and $30.3 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $80.1 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. As of March 28, 2009, we had $90.4 million of deferred revenue and $28.0 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $62.4 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers. Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no significant formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers. Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 6% of net revenues for all of the periods presented. Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances. Valuation of Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first in, first out method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts, which are also consistent with our short term manufacturing plans. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 24 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. Long lived assets such as goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are considered non financial assets, and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment exist. The accounting and disclosure guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB became effective for these assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. Goodwill As required by the authoritative guidance for goodwill established by the FASB, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For purposes of impairment testing, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2010. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified. Accounting for Income Taxes Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities positions and our assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in periods when these changes occur. We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We perform a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions relating to accounting for income taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. See Note 16. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 25 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes model, also require the use of input assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk free rate of return. We use implied volatility based on traded options in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume of market activity of traded options, and determined there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of options granted by us, such as date of grant and the exercise price, and determined the input assumptions were comparable; and the length of term of traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two years and which was extrapolated to match the expected term of the employee options granted by us, and determined the length of the option term was reasonable. The expected life of options granted is based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all options outstanding. We will continue to review our input assumptions and make changes as deemed appropriate depending on new information that becomes available. Higher volatility and expected lives result in a proportional increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return do not have as significant an effect on the calculation of fair value. In addition, we developed an estimate of the number of stock based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate have an effect on reported stock based compensation, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. The impact of forfeiture true up and forfeiture rate estimates in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 reduced stock based compensation expense by $16.7 million, $15.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates. Results of Operations The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years indicated: 2010 2009(1) 2008(1) Net Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 36.6 36.7 37.3 Gross Margin 63.4 63.3 62.7 Operating Expenses: Research and development 20.2 19.5 19.4 Selling, general and administrative 17.9 18.8 19.9 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 0.1 0.3 0.4 Restructuring charges 1.6 1.2 0.0 Total operating expenses 39.8 39.8 39.7 Operating Income 23.6 23.5 23.0 Gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures 0.0 4.1 0.0 Impairment loss on investments (0.2 ) (3.0 ) (0.2 ) Interest and other income (expense), net (0.4 ) 0.5 2.7 Income Before Income Taxes 23.0 25.1 25.5 Provision for income taxes 3.5 5.3 5.4 Net Income 19.5 % 19.8 % 20.1 % (1) We adopted the authoritative guidance of accounting for convertible debentures beginning in fiscal 2010. Prior results have been retrospectively adjusted in accordance with such guidance (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). 26 Table of Contents Net Revenues (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Net revenues $ 1,833.6 0 % $ 1,825.2 (1 )% $ 1,841.4 Net revenues in fiscal 2010 were essentially flat with fiscal 2009. Revenues in the last two quarters of fiscal 2010 were substantially higher than revenues in the first two quarters of the year. The first two quarters of fiscal 2010 were adversely impacted by economic conditions, and were also substantially lower than the same periods of the prior fiscal year. New Product revenues increased considerably in fiscal 2010 but were offset by the declines in Mainstream, Base and Support products. The 1% decline in net revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was largely due to the recessionary environment we experienced during the fiscal year which impacted our sales across a broad base of end markets. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, total unit sales declined and average selling price per unit increased compared to the comparable prior year periods. See Net Revenues by Product and Net Revenues by End Markets below for more information on our product and end market categories. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented. Net Revenues by Product We sell our products to global manufacturers of electronic products in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical and audio, video and broadcast. The vast majority of our net revenues are generated by sales of our semiconductor products, but we also generate sales from support products. We classify our product offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. The composition of each product category is as follows: New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the Virtex 6, Virtex 5, Spartan 6, Spartan 3A and Spartan 3E product families. Mainstream Products include the Virtex 4, Spartan 3, Spartan II and CoolRunner II product families. Base Products consist of our older product families including the Virtex, Virtex E, Virtex II, Spartan, XC4000, CoolRunner and XC9500 products. Support Products include configuration products (PROMs), software, IP cores, customer training, design services and support. These product categories, except for Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the age of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on March 29, 2009, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2010. Amounts for the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the new categorization. New Products include our most recent product offerings and are typically designed into our customers latest generation of electronic systems. Mainstream Products are generally several years old and designed into customer programs that are currently shipping in full production. Base Products are older than Mainstream Products with demand generated generally by the oldest customer systems still in production. Support Products are generally products or services sold in conjunction with our semiconductor devices to aid customers in the design process. Net revenues by product categories for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % of % % of % % of (In millions) 2010 Total Change 2009 Total Change 2008 Total New Products $ 580.0 32 78 $ 325.9 18 134 $ 139.5 8 Mainstream Products 604.6 33 (9 ) 666.1 37 2 653.5 35 Base Products 559.1 30 (24 ) 735.2 40 (22 ) 938.7 51 Support Products 89.9 5 (8 ) 98.0 5 (11 ) 109.7 6 Total net revenues $ 1,833.6 100 0 $ 1,825.2 100 (1 ) $ 1,841.4 100 Net revenues from New Products increased significantly in fiscal 2010 due to continued strong market acceptance of these products, particularly our 65 nm Virtex 5 product family. Sales from Virtex 5 nearly doubled in fiscal 2010. In addition, design win activity is strong for our next generation product families which include our high end, 40 nm Virtex 6 field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and our high volume, 45 nm Spartan 6 FPGAs. We expect these New Product families to contribute significantly to the growth in New Product revenues over time. In fiscal 2009, Virtex 5 and Spartan 3E contributed to the majority of the revenue growth versus the comparable prior year period. Net revenues from Mainstream Products declined in fiscal 2010 due to lower demand associated with the weakened economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year. Net revenues from Mainstream Products increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased sales of our Virtex 4 product family. The decline in net revenues from Base Products in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was expected since these products are mature and approaching the end of life. Net revenues from Support Products decreased in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period due to a decline in revenues from both our PROMs and software products. Net revenues from Support Products decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a decline in sales from our PROM products. 27 Table of Contents Net Revenues by End Markets Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers primary markets. We classify our net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications, Industrial and Other, Consumer and Automotive, and Data Processing. The percentage change calculation in the table below represents the year to year dollar change in each end market. Net revenues by end markets for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % Change % Change (% of total net revenues) 2010 in Dollars 2009 in Dollars 2008 Communications 47 % 7 44 % 1 43 % Industrial and Other 31 (4 ) 32 1 32 Consumer and Automotive 15 (7 ) 16 (6 ) 17 Data Processing 7 (4 ) 8 (9 ) 8 Total net revenues 100 % 0 100 % (1 ) 100 % Net revenues from Communications, our largest end market, increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year periods due to higher sales from wireless communication applications. In fiscal 2010, the decrease in net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market from the comparable prior year period was primarily driven by weaker sales in industrial, scientific and medical applications as well as test and measurement applications during the first half of the fiscal year. Net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market increased slightly in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period due to strong sales growth from aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific and medical applications. However, this growth was offset considerably by weakness in test and measurement applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to decreased sales in audio, video and broadcast and consumer applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period due to weaker sales from audio, video and broadcast and automotive applications, which were partially offset by an increase in sales from consumer applications. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, net revenues from the Data Processing end market declined from the comparable prior year periods due to decreases in sales from computing and data processing applications. Net Revenues by Geography Geographic revenue information reflects the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased our products. This may differ from the geographic location of the end customers. Net revenues by geography for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % of % % of % % of (In millions) 2010 Total Change 2009 Total Change 2008 Total North America $ 628.5 34 0 $ 627.7 34 (13 ) $ 717.8 39 Asia Pacific 649.1 35 8 603.0 33 15 526.3 29 Europe 395.1 22 (4 ) 411.6 23 1 407.2 22 Japan 160.9 9 (12 ) 182.9 10 (4 ) 190.1 10 Total net revenues $ 1,833.6 100 0 $ 1,825.2 100 (1 ) $ 1,841.4 100 Net revenues in North America were essentially flat in fiscal 2010 compared with the prior year period. Lower sales from the Consumer and Automotive end market offset strength in each of the other end markets including Communications, Industrial and Other and Data Processing. Net revenues in North America decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower sales from the Communications end market. Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. The increases were driven by strength in the Communications end market, primarily from the deployment of next generation wireless applications in China. Net revenues in Europe decreased in fiscal 2010 due to weaker sales in most end market applications with the exception of wireless communication and automotive applications. Net revenues in Europe increased in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period primarily due to strength in wireless communication applications. Net revenues in Japan decreased in fiscal 2010 due to broad based weakness across all end market categories. The fiscal 2009 decline was due to broad based weakness across most end market categories with the exception of the Consumer and Automotive end market. 28 Table of Contents Gross Margin (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Gross margin $ 1,161.8 1 % $ 1,156.0 0 % $ 1,154.4 Percentage of net revenues 63.4 % 63.3 % 62.7 % Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2010 was essentially flat from the comparable prior year period as cost savings related to yield improvement and overall restructuring effort were offset by the strength of New Products. New Products generally have lower gross margins than Mainstream and Base Products as they are in the early stage of their product life cycle and have higher unit costs associated with relatively lower volumes and early manufacturing maturity. The increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period was driven primarily by product cost reductions, higher average selling prices per unit and improved operational efficiency. Gross margin may be affected in the future by product mix shifts, competitive pricing pressure, manufacturing yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these factors by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving manufacturing efficiencies. Sales of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer products. Research and Development (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Research and development $ 369.5 4 % $ 355.4 (1 )% $ 358.1 Percentage of net revenues 20 % 19 % 19 % RD spending increased $14.1 million or 4% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to increased mask and wafer spending in fiscal 2010 associated with the introduction of the Virtex 6 and Spartan 6 product families. RD spending decreased $2.7 million or 1% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was attributable to lower mask and wafer spending and reduced stock based compensation expense, which was partially offset by increased outside services to support our investments in new product development. We plan to continue to selectively invest in RD efforts in areas such as new products and more advanced process development, IP cores and the development of new design and layout software. We will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas. Selling, General and Administrative (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Selling, general and administrative $ 327.6 (5 )% $ 343.8 (6 )% $ 365.3 Percentage of net revenues 18 % 19 % 20 % SGA expenses decreased $16.2 million or 5% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of restructuring measures taken during fiscal 2010, partially offset by higher litigation related expenses (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). SGA expenses decreased $21.5 million or 6% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of a functional reorganization announced during fiscal 2009, lower sales commissions and lower stock based compensation expense, which was partially offset by higher litigation costs. 29 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles $ 2.5 (53 )% $ 5.3 (22 )% $ 6.8 Amortization expense was related to the intangible assets acquired from prior acquisitions. Amortization expense for these intangible assets decreased for fiscal 2010 from the same period last year, due to the complete amortization of all intangible assets in fiscal 2010. Amortization expense for these intangible assets decreased for fiscal 2009 from the same period last year, due to the complete amortization of certain intangible assets in fiscal 2009. Restructuring Charges During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we announced restructuring measures designed to drive structural operating efficiencies across the Company. We completed this restructuring plan by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and reduced our global workforce by approximately 200 positions, or about 6%. These employee terminations impacted various geographies and functions worldwide. We recorded total restructuring charges of $30.1 million in fiscal 2010, primarily related to severance costs and benefits expenses. The following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity for fiscal 2010: Employee Facility severance related and (In millions) and benefits other costs Total Balance as of March 28, 2009 $ $ 0.7 $ 0.7 Restructuring charges 28.6 1.5 30.1 Cash payments (25.7 ) (2.1 ) (27.8 ) Non cash settlements (1.0 ) (1.0 ) Balance as of April 3, 2010 $ 1.9 $ 0.1 $ 2.0 These fiscal 2010 charges above, as well as fiscal 2009 charges included in the table below, have been shown separately as restructuring charges on the consolidated statements of income. The remaining accrual as of April 3, 2010 primarily relates to severance costs and benefits that are expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We estimate that severance costs and benefits expenses incurred in the fiscal 2010 restructuring will result in gross annual cash savings relating to employee compensation of approximately $23.0 million before taxes. We began realizing cash savings associated with the restructuring, primarily within the SGA and RD expense categories, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but we do not expect to fully realize the cash savings benefit until fiscal 2011. There can be no assurance that these expected future savings will be completely realized as they may be partially offset by increases in other expenses. In addition, we estimate cumulative stock based compensation expense savings of approximately $6.6 million through fiscal 2013 as a result of the fiscal 2010 restructuring. The vast majority of the stock based compensation expense savings already occurred in fiscal 2010. Future stock based compensation expense may increase depending on other factors, primarily the number of shares to be granted, fair value of the future stock awards under equity incentive plans (which are primarily impacted by our then market price of the common stock and stock price volatility) and the impact of future award forfeitures. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced a functional reorganization pursuant to which we eliminated 249 positions, or approximately 7% of our global workforce. These employee terminations occurred across various geographies and functions worldwide. The reorganization plan was completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We recorded total restructuring charges of $22.0 million in connection with the reorganization in fiscal 2009. These charges consisted of $20.5 million of severance costs and benefits expenses and $1.5 million of facility related costs. The following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity for fiscal 2009: Employee Facility severance and related (In millions) benefits costs Total Balance as of March 29, 2008 $ $ $ Restructuring charges 20.5 1.5 22.0 Cash payments (20.0 ) (0.6 ) (20.6 ) Non cash settlements (0.5 ) (0.2 ) (0.7 ) Balance as of March 28, 2009 $ $ 0.7 $ 0.7 30 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Stock based compensation included in: Cost of revenues $ 5.2 (11 )% $ 5.8 (24 )% $ 7.6 Research and development 25.8 3 % 25.0 (20 )% 31.4 Selling, general and administrative 24.6 7 % 23.1 (16 )% 27.4 Restructuring charges 0.9 68 % 0.6 $ 56.5 4 % $ 54.5 (18 )% $ 66.4 The $2.0 million increase in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2010 as compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in the number of shares granted, which was partly offset by declining weighted average fair values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal 2010 restructuring. The $11.9 million decrease in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period last year was due to a decrease in the number of shares granted, declining weighted average fair values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal 2009 restructuring. Gain on Early Extinguishment of Convertible Debentures During fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of our debentures and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $75.0 million, net of the write off of the pro rata portions of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $41.5 million and unamortized derivative valuation of $736 thousand. Accrued interest paid at the time of repurchases totaled $2.4 million. Beginning in fiscal 2010, we retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for convertible debentures issued by the FASB. The authoritative guidance specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of such instruments in a manner that reflects the borrowing rate for a similar non convertible debt. See Adoption of New Accounting Standard for Convertible Debentures included in Note 2. Basis of Presentation to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part 1. Financial Information, for further information relating to the adoption. Impairment Loss on Investments (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Impairment loss on investments $ 3.8 (93 )% $ 54.1 1,799 % $ 2.9 Percentage of net revenues 0 % 3 % 0 % We recorded an impairment loss on investments in non marketable equity securities of $3.8 million and $2.9 million for fiscal 2010 and 2008, respectively, due to the weak financial condition of certain investees. We recognized impairment losses on investments of $54.1 million during fiscal 2009, which consisted of $51.1 million impairment losses related to marketable debt and equity securities and $3.0 million impairment losses in non marketable equity securities. Of the $54.1 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2009, $38.0 million was related to senior class asset backed securities where the issuer went into receivership. The receiver subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a provision of a legal document governing the issuers securities. As a result of the outcome of the judicial determination, the receiver immediately liquidated the substantial majority of the issuers assets, and in accordance with the court order, the proceeds were used to repay short term liabilities in the order in which they fell due. In December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuers creditors the outcome of the judicial determination and that the issuers liabilities substantially exceeded its assets. As a result, the receiver estimated that the issuer would not be able to pay any liabilities falling due after October 2008 regardless of the seniority or status of the securities. Based on these developments, we concluded that it was not likely that we would recover the balance of our investment. This decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and, therefore, we recognized an impairment loss of $38.0 million on these securities during fiscal 2009. In October 2009, a higher court reversed the initial judicial interpretation and determined that the proceeds should be used to repay short term liabilities on a pari passu basis. Given the significant liabilities of the issuer, it is uncertain whether we will recover any of our original investment. We have not recognized any amount that may be due back to us. We also recognized an additional impairment loss of $10.0 million on marketable debt securities in our investment portfolio during fiscal 2009, $9.0 million of which was due to the bankruptcy filing by one of the issuers of the marketable debt securities. In addition to the aforementioned amounts, we recorded $3.1 million of impairment loss in marketable equity securities investment during fiscal 2009 as a result of the continued decline in its market value, which led us to believe that the decline in the market value was other than temporary. Furthermore, during the same period, we recorded $3.0 million of write down of our investment in non marketable equity securities in private companies, which was recorded due primarily to the weak financial condition of certain investees. 31 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net (In millions) 2010 Change 2009* Change 2008* Interest and other income (expense), net $ (6.6 ) (187 )% $ 7.6 (84 )% $ 48.1 Percentage of net revenues (0 )% 0 % 3 % * As adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2010 over the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates earned on the investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield on our investments decreased by over 2.5 percentage points year over year. The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2009 over the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates and a smaller investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield on our investments decreased by approximately 2.0 percentage points year over year. Interest expense also decreased in fiscal 2009 and further in 2010 due to the fact that we repurchased our debentures in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 12. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Provision for Income Taxes (In millions) 2010 Change 2009* Change 2008* Provision for income taxes $ 64.3 (33 )% $ 96.3 (4 )% $ 100.2 Percentage of net revenues 4 % 5 % 5 % Effective tax rate 15 % 21 % 21 % * As adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The effective tax rates in all years reflected the favorable impact of foreign income at statutory rates less than the U.S. rate and tax credits earned. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, when compared with fiscal 2009, was due to an increase in the amount permanently reinvested outside the U. S. in fiscal 2010 for which no U.S. taxes have been provided, thereby reducing the rates for the period, compounded by an increase in the fiscal 2009 rate for the gain on early extinguishment of debentures taxable at U.S. tax rates. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was flat when compared with fiscal 2008, as the recognized gain on the early extinguishment of debentures was offset by the benefit of retroactive extension of the research credit in fiscal 2009. The IRS examined our tax returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS, all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below. On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with us that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement. Accordingly, there were no additional taxes, penalties or interest due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the Appeals Court. On May 27, 2009, we received a 2 1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that we should include stock option amounts in our cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the Appeals Court, in a 2 1 majority opinion, affirmed the Tax Court decision in Xilinxs favor. In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. We began negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, we settled the proposed adjustment related to acquired technology with no net change in tax liability. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings included in Part I and Note 16. Income Taxes and Note 18. Litigation Settlements and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are available for future sale. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. As of April 3, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.39 billion and working capital of $1.55 billion. Cash provided by operations of $554.3 million for fiscal 2010 was $111.8 million higher than the $442.5 million generated during fiscal 2009. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non cash related items, increases in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and deferred income on shipment to distributors, which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, other assets, inventories and prepaid and other current assets as well as a decrease in income taxes payable. Net cash used in investing activities was $336.7 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $274.5 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $306.3 million of net purchases of available for sale securities and $28.2 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion below) and $2.3 million of other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $252.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $518.1 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $150.0 million for the repurchase of common stock, $165.6 million for dividend payments to stockholders and $1.3 million for reduction of tax benefits from stock based compensation. These items were partially offset by $64.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments increased by 21% from $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $262.7 million at the end of fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding increased to 53 days as of April 3, 2010 from 43 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily attributable to increase in net shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Inventories Inventories increased from $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009 to $130.6 million as of April 3, 2010. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel increased to 89 days as of April 3, 2010, compared to 80 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily due to higher inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of the higher anticipated demand. We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand. Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2010, we invested $28.2 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $39.1 million in fiscal 2009. Primary investments in fiscal 2010 were for software, testers, handlers, computer and other equipment. Property, plant and equipment expenditures could increase in the near future due to investment in infrastructure and manufacturing related equipment. Current Liabilities Current liabilities increased from $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $357.2 million at the end of fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities from variable spending driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same prior year period, and an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors. The increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to an increase in distributor inventories as of April 3, 2010 compared to the prior year. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased $171.7 million during fiscal 2010, from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009 to $2.12 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in stockholders equity was attributable to total comprehensive income of $375.1 million (which included net income of $357.5 million) for fiscal 2010, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $60.1 million and stock based compensation related amounts totaling $52.1 million (net of the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises). The increases were partially offset by the payment of dividends to stockholders of $165.6 million and the repurchase of common stock of $150.0 million. 33 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008 totaled $1.67 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively. As of March 28, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.32 billion and working capital of $1.52 billion. Cash provided by operations of $442.5 million for fiscal 2009 was $138.5 million lower than the $581.0 million generated during fiscal 2008. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non cash related items, an increase in deferred income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable, which were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors. Net cash provided by investing activities was $274.5 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to $192.0 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of $314.4 million of net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale securities. These items were partially offset by $39.1 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion below) and $793 thousand of other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $518.1 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to $541.9 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of $193.2 million for the repurchase of debentures, $275.0 million for the repurchase of common stock and $154.5 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $99.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $4.8 million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments decreased 13% from $249.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009. Days sales outstanding decreased to 43 days as of March 28, 2009 from 49 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease in net shipments and weaker linearity of shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Inventories Inventories decreased from $130.3 million as of March 29, 2008 to $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel decreased to 80 days as of March 28, 2009, compared to 94 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily due to lower inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of declining revenues due to lower anticipated demand and more effective inventory management processes. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2009, we invested $39.1 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $45.6 million in fiscal 2008. Primary investments in fiscal 2009 were for building improvements, test equipment, computer equipment and software. Current Liabilities Current liabilities decreased from $340.7 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in income taxes payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors. The decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to a decrease in distributor inventories as of March 28, 2009 compared to the prior year. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity decreased $20.4 million during fiscal 2009, from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2008 to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009. The decrease in stockholders equity was attributable to the repurchase of common stock of $275.0 million, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $154.5 million, an early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $72.6 million, an adjustment to the cumulative effect of adopting FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions of $10.1 million, unrealized losses on available for sale securities, net of deferred tax benefits, of $14.9 million, cumulative translation adjustment of $7.7 million and unrealized hedging transaction losses totaling $2.0 million. The decreases were partially offset by net income of $361.7 million for fiscal 2009, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $96.4 million, stock based compensation related amounts totaling $54.1 million and the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $4.2 million. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $250.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in April 2007. We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility. We also have a shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt, equity and other securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources. We used $150.0 million of cash to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2010 compared with $275.0 million used to repurchase 10.8 million shares in fiscal 2009. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million of cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of our debentures resulting in a net gain on early extinguishment of debentures of $75.0 million. During fiscal 2010, we paid $165.6 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.60 per common share. During fiscal 2009, we paid $154.5 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.56 per common share. In addition, on April 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2010. Our common stock and debentures repurchase program and dividend policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to RD, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, principal and interest payments on our debentures and other strategic investments. The global credit crisis has imposed exceptional levels of volatility and disruption in the capital markets, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and increased counterparty risk. Nevertheless, we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A included in Part I and below could affect our cash positions adversely. In addition, certain types of investments such as auction rate securities may present risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns. In the event that our investments in auction rate securities become illiquid, we do not expect this will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources or results of operations. As of April 3, 2010, marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were comprised of $61.6 million of student loan auction rate securities. The amount of assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as a percentage of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value was less than 4% as of April 3, 2010. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. During fiscal 2010, we sold $20.0 million notional value of senior class asset backed securities and realized a $1.0 million loss. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, $20.0 million notional value of senior class asset backed securities that were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs matured at par value. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of April 3, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities as of April 3, 2010.

Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was approximately $5.3 million for fiscal 2010. See Note 10. Commitments to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about operating leases. 35 Table of Contents (2) Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. (3) As of April 3, 2010, we had $10.0 million of non cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software maintenance expiring at various dates through September 2011. (4) We committed up to $5.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property until July 2023. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual property acquired. (5) In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of debentures due March 15, 2037. As a result of the repurchases in fiscal 2009, the remaining outstanding principal amount of the debentures as of April 3, 2010 was $689.6 million. The debentures require payment of interest at an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2007. For purposes of this table we have assumed the principal of our debentures will be paid on March 15, 2037. See Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about our debentures. As of April 3, 2010, $56.2 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were classified as long term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of April 3, 2010, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of April 3, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for information about recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.74 billion as of April 3, 2010. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio includes municipal bonds, floating rate notes, mortgage backed securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, student loan auction rate securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuers credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 100 basis point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than $10.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Credit Market Risk Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital markets experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may incur additional other than temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate. See Note 4. Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about our investments. 36 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, we had the following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts: April 3, March 28, (In thousands and U.S. dollars) 2010 2009 Euro $ 21,190 $ 51,072 Singapore dollar 58,420 30,123 Japanese Yen 12,268 12,563 British Pound 4,889 6,408 $ 96,767 $ 100,166 As part of our strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we employ a hedging program with a five quarter forward outlook for major foreign currency denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward currency exchange contracts expire at various dates between April 2010 and April 2011. The net unrealized gain or loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, was immaterial as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009. Our investments in several of our wholly owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Other monetary foreign denominated assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with gains and losses on revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the annualized foreign currency denominated operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by less than $8.0 million for each year. In addition, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the value of foreign currency denominated cash and investments by less than $6.0 million as of each date. 37 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Cautionary Statement The statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this document. Often, forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words, such as may, will, could, should, expect, believe, anticipate, estimate, continue, plan, intend, project and other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms. We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward looking statement provided in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for any reason. Nature of Operations We design, develop and market programmable platforms, including advanced ICs in the form of PLDs, software design tools and predefined system functions delivered as IP cores. In addition to our programmable platforms, we provide design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs by a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include: valuation of marketable and non marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long lived assets, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; and valuation and recognition of stock based compensation, which impacts gross margin, research and development (RD) expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Valuation of Marketable and Non marketable Securities Our short term and long term investments include marketable debt securities and non marketable equity securities. As of April 3, 2010, we had marketable debt securities with a fair value of $1.74 billion and non marketable equity securities in private companies of $17.7 million (adjusted cost). We determine the fair values for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard pricing services, data providers and other third party sources and by internally performing valuation analyses. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of the valuation methodologies. In determining if and when a decline in value below adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity securities is other than temporary, we evaluate on an ongoing basis the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying collateral and other key measures for our investments. We assess other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities in accordance with the latest guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). We recorded an other than temporary impairment for marketable debt securities and a marketable equity security in fiscal 2009. We did not record any other than temporary impairment for marketable debt or equity securities in fiscal 2010 or 2008. 23 Table of Contents Our investments in non marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of non marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in the investees industry, the investees product development status and subsequent rounds of financing and the related valuation and or our participation in such financings. We also assess the investees ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investees need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. The valuation methodology for determining the fair value of non marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss in the current periods operating results to the extent of the decline. We recorded other than temporary impairments for non marketable equity securities in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $3.8 million, 3.0 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors end customers. For fiscal 2010, approximately 69% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributors end customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from us. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms. As of April 3, 2010, we had $110.4 million of deferred revenue and $30.3 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $80.1 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. As of March 28, 2009, we had $90.4 million of deferred revenue and $28.0 million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $62.4 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers. Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no significant formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers. Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 6% of net revenues for all of the periods presented. Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances. Valuation of Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first in, first out method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts, which are also consistent with our short term manufacturing plans. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin. 24 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. Long lived assets such as goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are considered non financial assets, and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment exist. The accounting and disclosure guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB became effective for these assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. Goodwill As required by the authoritative guidance for goodwill established by the FASB, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For purposes of impairment testing, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2010. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified. Accounting for Income Taxes Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities positions and our assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in periods when these changes occur. We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We perform a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions relating to accounting for income taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. See Note 16. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 25 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Option pricing models, including the Black Scholes model, also require the use of input assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk free rate of return. We use implied volatility based on traded options in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume of market activity of traded options, and determined there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of options granted by us, such as date of grant and the exercise price, and determined the input assumptions were comparable; and the length of term of traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two years and which was extrapolated to match the expected term of the employee options granted by us, and determined the length of the option term was reasonable. The expected life of options granted is based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all options outstanding. We will continue to review our input assumptions and make changes as deemed appropriate depending on new information that becomes available. Higher volatility and expected lives result in a proportional increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return do not have as significant an effect on the calculation of fair value. In addition, we developed an estimate of the number of stock based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate have an effect on reported stock based compensation, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. The impact of forfeiture true up and forfeiture rate estimates in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 reduced stock based compensation expense by $16.7 million, $15.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The expense we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates. Results of Operations The following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years indicated: 2010 2009(1) 2008(1) Net Revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenues 36.6 36.7 37.3 Gross Margin 63.4 63.3 62.7 Operating Expenses: Research and development 20.2 19.5 19.4 Selling, general and administrative 17.9 18.8 19.9 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 0.1 0.3 0.4 Restructuring charges 1.6 1.2 0.0 Total operating expenses 39.8 39.8 39.7 Operating Income 23.6 23.5 23.0 Gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures 0.0 4.1 0.0 Impairment loss on investments (0.2 ) (3.0 ) (0.2 ) Interest and other income (expense), net (0.4 ) 0.5 2.7 Income Before Income Taxes 23.0 25.1 25.5 Provision for income taxes 3.5 5.3 5.4 Net Income 19.5 % 19.8 % 20.1 % (1) We adopted the authoritative guidance of accounting for convertible debentures beginning in fiscal 2010. Prior results have been retrospectively adjusted in accordance with such guidance (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). 26 Table of Contents Net Revenues (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Net revenues $ 1,833.6 0 % $ 1,825.2 (1 )% $ 1,841.4 Net revenues in fiscal 2010 were essentially flat with fiscal 2009. Revenues in the last two quarters of fiscal 2010 were substantially higher than revenues in the first two quarters of the year. The first two quarters of fiscal 2010 were adversely impacted by economic conditions, and were also substantially lower than the same periods of the prior fiscal year. New Product revenues increased considerably in fiscal 2010 but were offset by the declines in Mainstream, Base and Support products. The 1% decline in net revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was largely due to the recessionary environment we experienced during the fiscal year which impacted our sales across a broad base of end markets. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, total unit sales declined and average selling price per unit increased compared to the comparable prior year periods. See Net Revenues by Product and Net Revenues by End Markets below for more information on our product and end market categories. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented. Net Revenues by Product We sell our products to global manufacturers of electronic products in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical and audio, video and broadcast. The vast majority of our net revenues are generated by sales of our semiconductor products, but we also generate sales from support products. We classify our product offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. The composition of each product category is as follows: New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the Virtex 6, Virtex 5, Spartan 6, Spartan 3A and Spartan 3E product families. Mainstream Products include the Virtex 4, Spartan 3, Spartan II and CoolRunner II product families. Base Products consist of our older product families including the Virtex, Virtex E, Virtex II, Spartan, XC4000, CoolRunner and XC9500 products. Support Products include configuration products (PROMs), software, IP cores, customer training, design services and support. These product categories, except for Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to better reflect the age of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made on March 29, 2009, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2010. Amounts for the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the new categorization. New Products include our most recent product offerings and are typically designed into our customers latest generation of electronic systems. Mainstream Products are generally several years old and designed into customer programs that are currently shipping in full production. Base Products are older than Mainstream Products with demand generated generally by the oldest customer systems still in production. Support Products are generally products or services sold in conjunction with our semiconductor devices to aid customers in the design process. Net revenues by product categories for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % of % % of % % of (In millions) 2010 Total Change 2009 Total Change 2008 Total New Products $ 580.0 32 78 $ 325.9 18 134 $ 139.5 8 Mainstream Products 604.6 33 (9 ) 666.1 37 2 653.5 35 Base Products 559.1 30 (24 ) 735.2 40 (22 ) 938.7 51 Support Products 89.9 5 (8 ) 98.0 5 (11 ) 109.7 6 Total net revenues $ 1,833.6 100 0 $ 1,825.2 100 (1 ) $ 1,841.4 100 Net revenues from New Products increased significantly in fiscal 2010 due to continued strong market acceptance of these products, particularly our 65 nm Virtex 5 product family. Sales from Virtex 5 nearly doubled in fiscal 2010. In addition, design win activity is strong for our next generation product families which include our high end, 40 nm Virtex 6 field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and our high volume, 45 nm Spartan 6 FPGAs. We expect these New Product families to contribute significantly to the growth in New Product revenues over time. In fiscal 2009, Virtex 5 and Spartan 3E contributed to the majority of the revenue growth versus the comparable prior year period. Net revenues from Mainstream Products declined in fiscal 2010 due to lower demand associated with the weakened economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year. Net revenues from Mainstream Products increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased sales of our Virtex 4 product family. The decline in net revenues from Base Products in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was expected since these products are mature and approaching the end of life. Net revenues from Support Products decreased in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period due to a decline in revenues from both our PROMs and software products. Net revenues from Support Products decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a decline in sales from our PROM products. 27 Table of Contents Net Revenues by End Markets Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers primary markets. We classify our net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications, Industrial and Other, Consumer and Automotive, and Data Processing. The percentage change calculation in the table below represents the year to year dollar change in each end market. Net revenues by end markets for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % Change % Change (% of total net revenues) 2010 in Dollars 2009 in Dollars 2008 Communications 47 % 7 44 % 1 43 % Industrial and Other 31 (4 ) 32 1 32 Consumer and Automotive 15 (7 ) 16 (6 ) 17 Data Processing 7 (4 ) 8 (9 ) 8 Total net revenues 100 % 0 100 % (1 ) 100 % Net revenues from Communications, our largest end market, increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year periods due to higher sales from wireless communication applications. In fiscal 2010, the decrease in net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market from the comparable prior year period was primarily driven by weaker sales in industrial, scientific and medical applications as well as test and measurement applications during the first half of the fiscal year. Net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market increased slightly in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period due to strong sales growth from aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific and medical applications. However, this growth was offset considerably by weakness in test and measurement applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to decreased sales in audio, video and broadcast and consumer applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period due to weaker sales from audio, video and broadcast and automotive applications, which were partially offset by an increase in sales from consumer applications. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, net revenues from the Data Processing end market declined from the comparable prior year periods due to decreases in sales from computing and data processing applications. Net Revenues by Geography Geographic revenue information reflects the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased our products. This may differ from the geographic location of the end customers. Net revenues by geography for the fiscal years indicated were as follows: % of % % of % % of (In millions) 2010 Total Change 2009 Total Change 2008 Total North America $ 628.5 34 0 $ 627.7 34 (13 ) $ 717.8 39 Asia Pacific 649.1 35 8 603.0 33 15 526.3 29 Europe 395.1 22 (4 ) 411.6 23 1 407.2 22 Japan 160.9 9 (12 ) 182.9 10 (4 ) 190.1 10 Total net revenues $ 1,833.6 100 0 $ 1,825.2 100 (1 ) $ 1,841.4 100 Net revenues in North America were essentially flat in fiscal 2010 compared with the prior year period. Lower sales from the Consumer and Automotive end market offset strength in each of the other end markets including Communications, Industrial and Other and Data Processing. Net revenues in North America decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower sales from the Communications end market. Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. The increases were driven by strength in the Communications end market, primarily from the deployment of next generation wireless applications in China. Net revenues in Europe decreased in fiscal 2010 due to weaker sales in most end market applications with the exception of wireless communication and automotive applications. Net revenues in Europe increased in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period primarily due to strength in wireless communication applications. Net revenues in Japan decreased in fiscal 2010 due to broad based weakness across all end market categories. The fiscal 2009 decline was due to broad based weakness across most end market categories with the exception of the Consumer and Automotive end market. 28 Table of Contents Gross Margin (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Gross margin $ 1,161.8 1 % $ 1,156.0 0 % $ 1,154.4 Percentage of net revenues 63.4 % 63.3 % 62.7 % Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2010 was essentially flat from the comparable prior year period as cost savings related to yield improvement and overall restructuring effort were offset by the strength of New Products. New Products generally have lower gross margins than Mainstream and Base Products as they are in the early stage of their product life cycle and have higher unit costs associated with relatively lower volumes and early manufacturing maturity. The increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period was driven primarily by product cost reductions, higher average selling prices per unit and improved operational efficiency. Gross margin may be affected in the future by product mix shifts, competitive pricing pressure, manufacturing yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these factors by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving manufacturing efficiencies. Sales of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer products. Research and Development (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Research and development $ 369.5 4 % $ 355.4 (1 )% $ 358.1 Percentage of net revenues 20 % 19 % 19 % RD spending increased $14.1 million or 4% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to increased mask and wafer spending in fiscal 2010 associated with the introduction of the Virtex 6 and Spartan 6 product families. RD spending decreased $2.7 million or 1% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was attributable to lower mask and wafer spending and reduced stock based compensation expense, which was partially offset by increased outside services to support our investments in new product development. We plan to continue to selectively invest in RD efforts in areas such as new products and more advanced process development, IP cores and the development of new design and layout software. We will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas. Selling, General and Administrative (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Selling, general and administrative $ 327.6 (5 )% $ 343.8 (6 )% $ 365.3 Percentage of net revenues 18 % 19 % 20 % SGA expenses decreased $16.2 million or 5% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of restructuring measures taken during fiscal 2010, partially offset by higher litigation related expenses (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). SGA expenses decreased $21.5 million or 6% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of a functional reorganization announced during fiscal 2009, lower sales commissions and lower stock based compensation expense, which was partially offset by higher litigation costs. 29 Table of Contents Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles $ 2.5 (53 )% $ 5.3 (22 )% $ 6.8 Amortization expense was related to the intangible assets acquired from prior acquisitions. Amortization expense for these intangible assets decreased for fiscal 2010 from the same period last year, due to the complete amortization of all intangible assets in fiscal 2010. Amortization expense for these intangible assets decreased for fiscal 2009 from the same period last year, due to the complete amortization of certain intangible assets in fiscal 2009. Restructuring Charges During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we announced restructuring measures designed to drive structural operating efficiencies across the Company. We completed this restructuring plan by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and reduced our global workforce by approximately 200 positions, or about 6%. These employee terminations impacted various geographies and functions worldwide. We recorded total restructuring charges of $30.1 million in fiscal 2010, primarily related to severance costs and benefits expenses. The following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity for fiscal 2010: Employee Facility severance related and (In millions) and benefits other costs Total Balance as of March 28, 2009 $ $ 0.7 $ 0.7 Restructuring charges 28.6 1.5 30.1 Cash payments (25.7 ) (2.1 ) (27.8 ) Non cash settlements (1.0 ) (1.0 ) Balance as of April 3, 2010 $ 1.9 $ 0.1 $ 2.0 These fiscal 2010 charges above, as well as fiscal 2009 charges included in the table below, have been shown separately as restructuring charges on the consolidated statements of income. The remaining accrual as of April 3, 2010 primarily relates to severance costs and benefits that are expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We estimate that severance costs and benefits expenses incurred in the fiscal 2010 restructuring will result in gross annual cash savings relating to employee compensation of approximately $23.0 million before taxes. We began realizing cash savings associated with the restructuring, primarily within the SGA and RD expense categories, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but we do not expect to fully realize the cash savings benefit until fiscal 2011. There can be no assurance that these expected future savings will be completely realized as they may be partially offset by increases in other expenses. In addition, we estimate cumulative stock based compensation expense savings of approximately $6.6 million through fiscal 2013 as a result of the fiscal 2010 restructuring. The vast majority of the stock based compensation expense savings already occurred in fiscal 2010. Future stock based compensation expense may increase depending on other factors, primarily the number of shares to be granted, fair value of the future stock awards under equity incentive plans (which are primarily impacted by our then market price of the common stock and stock price volatility) and the impact of future award forfeitures. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced a functional reorganization pursuant to which we eliminated 249 positions, or approximately 7% of our global workforce. These employee terminations occurred across various geographies and functions worldwide. The reorganization plan was completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. We recorded total restructuring charges of $22.0 million in connection with the reorganization in fiscal 2009. These charges consisted of $20.5 million of severance costs and benefits expenses and $1.5 million of facility related costs. The following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity for fiscal 2009: Employee Facility severance and related (In millions) benefits costs Total Balance as of March 29, 2008 $ $ $ Restructuring charges 20.5 1.5 22.0 Cash payments (20.0 ) (0.6 ) (20.6 ) Non cash settlements (0.5 ) (0.2 ) (0.7 ) Balance as of March 28, 2009 $ $ 0.7 $ 0.7 30 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Stock based compensation included in: Cost of revenues $ 5.2 (11 )% $ 5.8 (24 )% $ 7.6 Research and development 25.8 3 % 25.0 (20 )% 31.4 Selling, general and administrative 24.6 7 % 23.1 (16 )% 27.4 Restructuring charges 0.9 68 % 0.6 $ 56.5 4 % $ 54.5 (18 )% $ 66.4 The $2.0 million increase in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2010 as compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in the number of shares granted, which was partly offset by declining weighted average fair values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal 2010 restructuring. The $11.9 million decrease in stock based compensation expense for fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period last year was due to a decrease in the number of shares granted, declining weighted average fair values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal 2009 restructuring. Gain on Early Extinguishment of Convertible Debentures During fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of our debentures and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $75.0 million, net of the write off of the pro rata portions of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $41.5 million and unamortized derivative valuation of $736 thousand. Accrued interest paid at the time of repurchases totaled $2.4 million. Beginning in fiscal 2010, we retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for convertible debentures issued by the FASB. The authoritative guidance specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of such instruments in a manner that reflects the borrowing rate for a similar non convertible debt. See Adoption of New Accounting Standard for Convertible Debentures included in Note 2. Basis of Presentation to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part 1. Financial Information, for further information relating to the adoption. Impairment Loss on Investments (In millions) 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Impairment loss on investments $ 3.8 (93 )% $ 54.1 1,799 % $ 2.9 Percentage of net revenues 0 % 3 % 0 % We recorded an impairment loss on investments in non marketable equity securities of $3.8 million and $2.9 million for fiscal 2010 and 2008, respectively, due to the weak financial condition of certain investees. We recognized impairment losses on investments of $54.1 million during fiscal 2009, which consisted of $51.1 million impairment losses related to marketable debt and equity securities and $3.0 million impairment losses in non marketable equity securities. Of the $54.1 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2009, $38.0 million was related to senior class asset backed securities where the issuer went into receivership. The receiver subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a provision of a legal document governing the issuers securities. As a result of the outcome of the judicial determination, the receiver immediately liquidated the substantial majority of the issuers assets, and in accordance with the court order, the proceeds were used to repay short term liabilities in the order in which they fell due. In December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuers creditors the outcome of the judicial determination and that the issuers liabilities substantially exceeded its assets. As a result, the receiver estimated that the issuer would not be able to pay any liabilities falling due after October 2008 regardless of the seniority or status of the securities. Based on these developments, we concluded that it was not likely that we would recover the balance of our investment. This decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and, therefore, we recognized an impairment loss of $38.0 million on these securities during fiscal 2009. In October 2009, a higher court reversed the initial judicial interpretation and determined that the proceeds should be used to repay short term liabilities on a pari passu basis. Given the significant liabilities of the issuer, it is uncertain whether we will recover any of our original investment. We have not recognized any amount that may be due back to us. We also recognized an additional impairment loss of $10.0 million on marketable debt securities in our investment portfolio during fiscal 2009, $9.0 million of which was due to the bankruptcy filing by one of the issuers of the marketable debt securities. In addition to the aforementioned amounts, we recorded $3.1 million of impairment loss in marketable equity securities investment during fiscal 2009 as a result of the continued decline in its market value, which led us to believe that the decline in the market value was other than temporary. Furthermore, during the same period, we recorded $3.0 million of write down of our investment in non marketable equity securities in private companies, which was recorded due primarily to the weak financial condition of certain investees. 31 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net (In millions) 2010 Change 2009* Change 2008* Interest and other income (expense), net $ (6.6 ) (187 )% $ 7.6 (84 )% $ 48.1 Percentage of net revenues (0 )% 0 % 3 % * As adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2010 over the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates earned on the investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield on our investments decreased by over 2.5 percentage points year over year. The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2009 over the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in interest rates and a smaller investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield on our investments decreased by approximately 2.0 percentage points year over year. Interest expense also decreased in fiscal 2009 and further in 2010 due to the fact that we repurchased our debentures in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 12. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Provision for Income Taxes (In millions) 2010 Change 2009* Change 2008* Provision for income taxes $ 64.3 (33 )% $ 96.3 (4 )% $ 100.2 Percentage of net revenues 4 % 5 % 5 % Effective tax rate 15 % 21 % 21 % * As adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The effective tax rates in all years reflected the favorable impact of foreign income at statutory rates less than the U.S. rate and tax credits earned. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, when compared with fiscal 2009, was due to an increase in the amount permanently reinvested outside the U. S. in fiscal 2010 for which no U.S. taxes have been provided, thereby reducing the rates for the period, compounded by an increase in the fiscal 2009 rate for the gain on early extinguishment of debentures taxable at U.S. tax rates. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was flat when compared with fiscal 2008, as the recognized gain on the early extinguishment of debentures was offset by the benefit of retroactive extension of the research credit in fiscal 2009. The IRS examined our tax returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS, all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below. On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with us that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement. Accordingly, there were no additional taxes, penalties or interest due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the Appeals Court. On May 27, 2009, we received a 2 1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that we should include stock option amounts in our cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the Appeals Court, in a 2 1 majority opinion, affirmed the Tax Court decision in Xilinxs favor. In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. We began negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, we settled the proposed adjustment related to acquired technology with no net change in tax liability. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings included in Part I and Note 16. Income Taxes and Note 18. Litigation Settlements and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are available for future sale. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. As of April 3, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.39 billion and working capital of $1.55 billion. Cash provided by operations of $554.3 million for fiscal 2010 was $111.8 million higher than the $442.5 million generated during fiscal 2009. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non cash related items, increases in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and deferred income on shipment to distributors, which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, other assets, inventories and prepaid and other current assets as well as a decrease in income taxes payable. Net cash used in investing activities was $336.7 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $274.5 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $306.3 million of net purchases of available for sale securities and $28.2 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion below) and $2.3 million of other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $252.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $518.1 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $150.0 million for the repurchase of common stock, $165.6 million for dividend payments to stockholders and $1.3 million for reduction of tax benefits from stock based compensation. These items were partially offset by $64.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments increased by 21% from $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $262.7 million at the end of fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding increased to 53 days as of April 3, 2010 from 43 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily attributable to increase in net shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Inventories Inventories increased from $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009 to $130.6 million as of April 3, 2010. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel increased to 89 days as of April 3, 2010, compared to 80 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily due to higher inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of the higher anticipated demand. We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand. Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2010, we invested $28.2 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $39.1 million in fiscal 2009. Primary investments in fiscal 2010 were for software, testers, handlers, computer and other equipment. Property, plant and equipment expenditures could increase in the near future due to investment in infrastructure and manufacturing related equipment. Current Liabilities Current liabilities increased from $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $357.2 million at the end of fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities from variable spending driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same prior year period, and an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors. The increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to an increase in distributor inventories as of April 3, 2010 compared to the prior year. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity increased $171.7 million during fiscal 2010, from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009 to $2.12 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in stockholders equity was attributable to total comprehensive income of $375.1 million (which included net income of $357.5 million) for fiscal 2010, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $60.1 million and stock based compensation related amounts totaling $52.1 million (net of the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises). The increases were partially offset by the payment of dividends to stockholders of $165.6 million and the repurchase of common stock of $150.0 million. 33 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short term and Long term Investments The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short term and long term investments as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008 totaled $1.67 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively. As of March 28, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.32 billion and working capital of $1.52 billion. Cash provided by operations of $442.5 million for fiscal 2009 was $138.5 million lower than the $581.0 million generated during fiscal 2008. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non cash related items, an increase in deferred income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable, which were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors. Net cash provided by investing activities was $274.5 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to $192.0 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of $314.4 million of net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale securities. These items were partially offset by $39.1 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion below) and $793 thousand of other investing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $518.1 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to $541.9 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of $193.2 million for the repurchase of debentures, $275.0 million for the repurchase of common stock and $154.5 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $99.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $4.8 million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments decreased 13% from $249.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009. Days sales outstanding decreased to 43 days as of March 28, 2009 from 49 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease in net shipments and weaker linearity of shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Inventories Inventories decreased from $130.3 million as of March 29, 2008 to $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel decreased to 80 days as of March 28, 2009, compared to 94 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily due to lower inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of declining revenues due to lower anticipated demand and more effective inventory management processes. Property, Plant and Equipment During fiscal 2009, we invested $39.1 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $45.6 million in fiscal 2008. Primary investments in fiscal 2009 were for building improvements, test equipment, computer equipment and software. Current Liabilities Current liabilities decreased from $340.7 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in income taxes payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors. The decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to a decrease in distributor inventories as of March 28, 2009 compared to the prior year. Stockholders Equity Stockholders equity decreased $20.4 million during fiscal 2009, from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2008 to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009. The decrease in stockholders equity was attributable to the repurchase of common stock of $275.0 million, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $154.5 million, an early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $72.6 million, an adjustment to the cumulative effect of adopting FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions of $10.1 million, unrealized losses on available for sale securities, net of deferred tax benefits, of $14.9 million, cumulative translation adjustment of $7.7 million and unrealized hedging transaction losses totaling $2.0 million. The decreases were partially offset by net income of $361.7 million for fiscal 2009, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $96.4 million, stock based compensation related amounts totaling $54.1 million and the related tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $4.2 million. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $250.0 million revolving credit facility entered into in April 2007. We are not aware of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our credit facility is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility. We also have a shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt, equity and other securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital resources. We used $150.0 million of cash to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2010 compared with $275.0 million used to repurchase 10.8 million shares in fiscal 2009. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million of cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of our debentures resulting in a net gain on early extinguishment of debentures of $75.0 million. During fiscal 2010, we paid $165.6 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.60 per common share. During fiscal 2009, we paid $154.5 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.56 per common share. In addition, on April 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 19, 2010. Our common stock and debentures repurchase program and dividend policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to RD, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, principal and interest payments on our debentures and other strategic investments. The global credit crisis has imposed exceptional levels of volatility and disruption in the capital markets, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and increased counterparty risk. Nevertheless, we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A included in Part I and below could affect our cash positions adversely. In addition, certain types of investments such as auction rate securities may present risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns. In the event that our investments in auction rate securities become illiquid, we do not expect this will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources or results of operations. As of April 3, 2010, marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were comprised of $61.6 million of student loan auction rate securities. The amount of assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as a percentage of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value was less than 4% as of April 3, 2010. See Note 3. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information. During fiscal 2010, we sold $20.0 million notional value of senior class asset backed securities and realized a $1.0 million loss. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, $20.0 million notional value of senior class asset backed securities that were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs matured at par value. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of April 3, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities as of April 3, 2010. Payments Due by Period Less than More than (In millions) Total 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 18.0 $ 7.9 $ 5.7 $ 2.8 $ 1.6 Inventory and other purchase obligations (2) 129.5 129.5 Electronic design automation software licenses (3) 10.0 10.0 Intellectual property license rights obligations (4) 5.0 5.0 3.125% convertible debentures principal and interest (5) 1,271.5 21.6 43.1 43.1 1,163.7 Total $ 1,434.0 $ 169.0 $ 48.8 $ 45.9 $ 1,170.3 (1) We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through November 2035. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all operating leases was approximately $5.3 million for fiscal 2010. See Note 10. Commitments to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about operating leases. 35 Table of Contents (2) Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. (3) As of April 3, 2010, we had $10.0 million of non cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software maintenance expiring at various dates through September 2011. (4) We committed up to $5.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property until July 2023. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual property acquired. (5) In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of debentures due March 15, 2037. As a result of the repurchases in fiscal 2009, the remaining outstanding principal amount of the debentures as of April 3, 2010 was $689.6 million. The debentures require payment of interest at an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2007. For purposes of this table we have assumed the principal of our debentures will be paid on March 15, 2037. See Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about our debentures. As of April 3, 2010, $56.2 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were classified as long term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of April 3, 2010, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of April 3, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for information about recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.74 billion as of April 3, 2010. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio includes municipal bonds, floating rate notes, mortgage backed securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, student loan auction rate securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuers credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 100 basis point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than $10.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. Credit Market Risk Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital markets experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may incur additional other than temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate. See Note 4. Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information about our investments. 36 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred. We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, we had the following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts: April 3, March 28, (In thousands and U.S. dollars) 2010 2009 Euro $ 21,190 $ 51,072 Singapore dollar 58,420 30,123 Japanese Yen 12,268 12,563 British Pound 4,889 6,408 $ 96,767 $ 100,166 As part of our strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we employ a hedging program with a five quarter forward outlook for major foreign currency denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward currency exchange contracts expire at various dates between April 2010 and April 2011. The net unrealized gain or loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, was immaterial as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009. Our investments in several of our wholly owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Other monetary foreign denominated assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with gains and losses on revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the annualized foreign currency denominated operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by less than $8.0 million for each year. In addition, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the value of foreign currency denominated cash and investments by less than $6.0 million as of each date. 37 Table of Contents
