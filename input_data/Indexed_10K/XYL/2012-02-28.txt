ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended December 31, 2011. Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, Xylem, we, us, our and the Company refer to Xylem Inc. and its subsidiaries. References in the consolidated and combined financial statements to ITT or parent refer to ITT Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than Xylem Inc.). On and prior to October 31, 2011, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows consisted of the water equipment and services businesses of ITT Corporation (WaterCo) and have been derived from ITTs historical accounting records and are presented on a carve out basis through our Distribution Date, while our financial results for Xylem post Spin off are prepared on a stand alone basis. In addition, financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 consists of the consolidated results of Xylem on a stand alone basis for the two months of November and December and the combined results of operations of WaterCo for ten months on a carve out basis. The twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 consist entirely of the combined results of WaterCo on a carve out basis. Overview Xylem Inc. (Xylem or the Company) is a leading equipment and service provider for water and wastewater applications with a broad portfolio of products and services addressing the full cycle of water, from collection, distribution and use to the return of water to the environment. Xylem operates in two segments, Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. The Water Infrastructure segment focuses on the transportation, treatment and testing of water, offering a range of products including water and wastewater pumps, treatment and testing equipment, and controls and systems. The Applied Water segment encompasses all the uses of water and focuses on the residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural markets. The segments major products include pumps, valves, heat exchangers, controls and dispensing equipment. Xylem Inc. (f/k/a ITT WCO, Inc.) was incorporated in Indiana on May 4, 2011. The name of the Company was changed from ITT WCO, Inc. to Xylem Inc. on July 14, 2011. Our business focuses on providing technology intensive equipment and services. We sell our equipment and services via direct and indirect channels that serve the needs of each customer type. On the utility side, we provide over 70% direct sales with strong application expertise, with the remaining amount going through distribution partners. To end users of water, we provide over 85% of our sales through long standing relationships with the worlds leading distributors, with the remainder going direct to customers. The total market opportunity for this Equipment and Services portion of the water industry supply chain is estimated at $280 billion. Our product and service offerings are organized into two segments: Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. Our segments are aligned with each of the sectors in the cycle of water, supply infrastructure and usage applications. Water Infrastructure serves the supply infrastructure sector with pump systems that transport water from aquifers, lakes, rivers and seas; with filtration, ultraviolet and ozone systems that provide treatment, making the water fit to use; and providing pump lift stations that move the wastewater to treatment facilities where our mixers, biological treatment, monitoring, and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process. Applied Water serves the usage applications sector with boosting systems for farming irrigation, pumps for dairy operations, and rainwater reuse systems for small scale crop and turf irrigation. In addition, our pumps, heat exchangers, valves and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities, as well as circulation for food and beverage processing. 33 Table of Contents Separation from ITT Corporation (ITT) On October 31, 2011, ITT Corporation completed the previously announced Spin off (the Spin off) of Xylem, formerly ITTs water equipment and services businesses. Effective as of 12:01 a.m., Eastern time on October 31, 2011 (the Distribution Date), the common stock of Xylem was distributed, on a pro rata basis, to ITTs shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 17, 2011 (the Record Date). On the Distribution Date, each of the shareholders of ITT received one share of Xylem common stock for every one share of common stock of ITT held on the Record Date. The Spin off was completed pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2011, among ITT, Exelis Inc. and Xylem. After the Distribution Date, ITT does not beneficially own any shares of Xylem common stock and, following such date, financial results of Xylem will not be consolidated in ITTs financial reporting. Xylems Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was declared effective on October 6, 2011. Xylems common stock began regular way trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 1, 2011 under the symbol XYL. Executive Summary Xylem reported revenue for 2011 of $3,803 million, an increase of 18.8% from $3,202 million reported in 2010, due to broad based growth across both segments. Operating income for the year ended 2011, excluding costs of $87 million incurred to execute the separation from ITT, was $482 million, reflecting an increase of $94 million or 24.2% compared to $388 million in 2010. Additional financial highlights for 2011 include the following: Net income of $279 million, or $1.50 per diluted share Order growth of 18.8% over the prior year; organic orders were up 6.7% Revenue increase of 18.8% from 2010; organic revenue was up 7.1% Completion of the YSI Incorporated (YSI) acquisition, which contributed approximately $35 million of revenue to the Water Infrastructure segment results Adjusted net income of $358 million, an increase of $72 million from 2010s adjusted net income Free cash flow generation of $388 million, up $87 million from 2010 Key Performance Indicators and Non GAAP Measures Management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, segment operating income and margins, earnings per share, orders growth, and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per diluted share or net cash from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non GAAP measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators: organic revenue and organic orders defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, intercompany transactions and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation. The period over period change resulting from foreign currency fluctuations assumes no change in exchange rates from the prior period. 34 Table of Contents adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share defined as net income and earnings per share, respectively, adjusted to exclude non recurring separation costs associated with the Spin off and tax related special items. A reconciliation of adjusted net income is provided below.

The following table illustrates the impact from organic growth, recent acquisitions, and fluctuations in foreign currency, in relation to revenue during the annual 2011 period. (in millions) $ Change % Change 2010 Revenue $ 3,202 Organic Growth 226 7.1 % Acquisitions/(Divestitures), net 264 8.2 % Foreign currency translation 111 3.5 % Total change in revenue 601 18.8 % 2011 Revenue $ 3,803 The following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2011 and 2010: (in millions) 2011 2010 Change Water Infrastructure $ 2,416 $ 1,930 25.2% Applied Water 1,444 1,327 8.8% Eliminations (57 ) (55 ) Total $ 3,803 $ 3,202 18.8% Water Infrastructure Water Infrastructures revenue increased $486 million, or 25.2% in 2011, including incremental revenue of $264 million from acquisitions, including Godwin and Nova in 2010 and YSI in September 2011. Our 2011 acquisition of YSI contributed $35 million and continued our expansion in the analytical instrumentation market. Organic revenue growth of $137 million or 7.1% during the year was primarily attributable to transport and treatment applications. Transport increased due to dewatering equipment volume from both the public utility and industrial sectors. The results also reflect increased public utility investment in treatment projects in Latin America and the Middle East. Overall growth was partially offset by decreased volume in Southern Europe, which continues to present challenging economic conditions. Foreign currency translation was favorable by $87 million for the annual period ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010. Applied Water Applied Waters revenue increased $117 million, or 8.8% in 2011, driven by organic revenue growth of $88 million or 6.6%. The organic revenue growth reflects gains across all regions lead by double digit growth rates in Eastern Europe, Latin America, China and the Middle East, primarily due to increased volume in light industrial and building service applications as a result of new products such as e SV, a high efficiency vertical multi stage pump, and increased volume in the irrigation applications as a result of favorable weather conditions in the United States. Pricing initiatives executed throughout the period also contributed to the revenue growth. Foreign currency translation was favorable by $28 million for 2011, as compared to 2010. 36 Table of Contents Orders/Backlog Orders received during 2011 increased by $610 million, or 18.8% to $3,847 million, including benefits of $272 million from acquisitions and $120 million from foreign currency translation adjustments. Organic order growth was 6.7% for the year. The Water Infrastructure segment generated order growth of $513 million, or 26.4% to $2,454 million, including $272 million and $96 million from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency, respectively. Order growth in our Applied Water segment was $100 million or 7.4% to $1,452 million, driven by 5.3% organic order growth and $27 million of favorable foreign currency translation due to increased activity in the light industrial, agriculture and heat transfer markets. Delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based upon their requirements. Typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles and delays can occur from time to time. Total backlog was $651 million at December 31, 2011 and $620 million at December 31, 2010. We anticipate that in excess of 80% of the backlog at December 31, 2011 will be recognized as revenue during 2012. Gross Margin Gross margins, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, increased to 38.4% in 2011 from 37.9% in 2010. The increase is attributable to benefits from productivity and price realization initiatives offset, in part, by rising commodity costs and higher labor and overhead costs due to increased spending related to additional volume. Operating Expenses excluding Separation Costs (in millions) 2011 2010 Change Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) $ 877 $ 737 19.0% SG&A as a % of revenue 23.1 % 23.0 % 10bp Research and Development (R&D) 100 74 35.1% R&D as a % of revenue 2.6 % 2.3 % 30bp Restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 2 15 (86.7)% Operating expenses excluding separation costs 979 826 18.5% Expense to revenue ratio 25.7 % 25.8 % (10)bp Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A increased by $140 million to $877 million or 23.1% of revenue in 2011, as compared to $737 million or 23.0% of revenue in 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses is principally due to sales volume related increases in selling, marketing and distribution expenses, including the impact of recent acquisitions. Research and Development Expenses R&D spending increased $26 million to $100 million or 2.6% of revenue for 2011 as compared to $74 million or 2.3% of revenue in 2010. These increases were primarily due to $11 million incremental expense from recent acquisitions and programs as we continued to invest in new product developments. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges, net During 2011, we incurred a $2 million charge related to the impairment of a facility in our Applied Water segment. During 2010, we recognized restructuring charges totaling $15 million as part of an initiative to improve effectiveness and efficiency of operations. As of December 31, 2011, we consider these restructuring initiatives to be substantially completed, with a remaining liability of $1 million. 37 Table of Contents Separation Costs We had non recurring pre tax separation costs of $87 million, or $72 million after tax, during 2011. The components of separation costs incurred during these periods is presented below (in millions). IT costs $ 19 Advisory fees 18 Employee retention and hiring costs 14 Rebranding and marketing costs 13 Lease termination and other real estate costs 10 Non cash asset impairments (a) 8 Other 5 Total separation costs in operating income 87 Tax related separation costs 6 Income tax benefit (21 ) Total separation costs, net of tax $ 72 (a) During the third quarter, we recorded an impairment charge of $8 million on one of our facilities in China within our Applied Water segment. Prior to the separation this was a shared facility among certain Xylem and ITT businesses and in connection with the separation, the removal of certain ITT operations triggered an impairment evaluation. The fair value of the applicable assets was calculated using the cost approach. Our current estimate of the pre tax cash impact of the remaining activities associated with the separation ranges from approximately $15 million to $20 million. Operating Income We generated operating income of $395 million during 2011, a 1.8% increase from the prior year, primarily reflecting increased revenues offset, in part, by non recurring separation costs of $87 million. The following table illustrates operating income results by business segments for 2011 and 2010.

Water Infrastructure Operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment increased $67 million or 24.3% ($83 million or 30.1% excluding separation costs) compared with the prior year. This increase is led by incremental operating income of $42 million from acquisitions over the same period. Also contributing to the increase were higher sales volumes, lower restructuring expense and benefits from productivity and material costs savings initiatives, partially offset by higher labor and overhead costs, material inflation and unfavorable mix. Applied Water Operating income for our Applied Water segment increased $2 million or 1.3% ($15 million or 9.5% excluding separation costs) compared to the prior year as higher sales volume and price realization was partially offset by increased spend on research and development and the unfavorable impacts of inflation, and customer and product mix. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $17 million in 2011, primarily reflecting interest related to the issuance of $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in September 2011. Refer to Note 8, Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt, for further details. Income Tax Expense The income tax provision for 2011 was $104 million at an effective tax rate of 27.4% compared to $59 million at an effective tax rate of 15.2% in 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate is higher than 2010 as a result of the unfavorable impact of recording a deferred tax liability on the excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries that has not been permanently reinvested, non deductible separation costs, increase in valuation allowances on certain foreign losses offset in part by tax examination settlements and increased tax exempt interest. 39 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue Revenue generated during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3,202 million reflecting an increase of $353 million or 12.4% as compared to prior year. Our 2010 revenue was marked by growth from strategic acquisitions, a level of economic recovery within the majority of our served markets and foreign currency translation. The following table illustrates the impact from organic growth, recent acquisitions, and fluctuations in foreign currency, in relation to revenue during 2010. (in millions) $ Change % Change 2009 Revenue $ 2,849 Organic Growth 96 3.4% Acquisitions/(Divestitures), net 263 9.2% Foreign currency translation (6 ) (0.2)% Total change in revenue 353 12.4% 2010 Revenue $ 3,202 The following table summarizes revenue by segment for 2010 and 2009: (in millions) 2010 2009 Change Water Infrastructure $ 1,930 $ 1,651 16.9% Applied Water 1,327 1,254 5.8% Eliminations (55 ) (56 ) Total $ 3,202 $ 2,849 12.4% Water Infrastructure Revenue generated by our Water Infrastructure segment for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1,930 million reflecting an increase of $279 million, or 16.9% as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by incremental revenue from acquisitions, including Godwin and Nova, which in the aggregate contributed $247 million. Organic revenue increased 1.5% in 2010 reflecting mixed regional results. Market share gains and favorable economic conditions drove improved performance for treatment applications in Northern Europe and in emerging markets such as Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe and Latin America. However, unfavorable economic conditions and uncertainty within the region continued to negatively impact performance across our Southern European markets. Foreign exchange translation was favorable by $8 million for 2010, as compared to 2009. Applied Water Applied Waters revenue increased $73 million, or 5.8%, for 2010 compared to 2009, as contributions from the 2009 Laing acquisition of $19 million were partially offset by a decline in revenues from businesses divested of $3 million. Despite relatively weak market conditions throughout the year, we recorded organic revenue growth of $72 million or 5.8% over 2009. This growth was primarily attributable to European and emerging market share gains as well as the impact from new product launches, including energy efficient pumps and new beverage applications. We also benefited from price realization initiatives. Organic revenue growth was partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions in North America, which negatively impacted our sales of irrigation applications. Foreign exchange translation was unfavorable by $16 million for 2010, as compared to 2009. 40 Table of Contents Gross Margin Gross margins as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points to 37.9% in 2010 compared to 36.4% in 2009. The increase includes gross profits driven by increased organic sales volume, and benefits from productivity and price realization initiatives. Operating Expenses (in millions) 2010 2009 Change Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) $ 737 $ 667 10.5% SG&A as a % of revenue 23.0 % 23.4 % (40)bp Research and Development (R&D) 74 63 17.5% R&D as a % of revenue 2.3 % 2.2 % 10bp Restructuring and asset impairment charges, net 15 31 (51.6)% Operating expenses 826 761 8.5% Expense to revenue ratio 25.8 % 26.7 % (90)bp Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A increased by $70 million to $737 million or 23% of revenue in 2010 as compared to $667 million or 23.4% of revenue in 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses is principally due to additional costs of $55 million in each period related primarily to our newly acquired Godwin and Nova businesses, as well as costs attributable to an increase in sales volumes, and additional spending on various strategic investments. Research and Development Expenses R&D spending increased $11 million to $74 million or 2.3% of revenue in 2010 as compared to $63 million or 2.2% in 2009 primarily due to our newly acquired Nova business. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges, net During 2010, we recognized net restructuring charges of $15 million, representing a $16 million or 51.6% decrease as compared to the prior year. During 2009, we initiated several actions, primarily within our Applied Water segment in response to declining market conditions. The frequency and overall impact of such actions subsided and as a result we incurred less cost during 2010. Operating Income We generated operating income of $388 million in 2010, which reflects an increase from the prior year of 40.6%. Operating margin increased to 12.1%, a year over year increase of 240 basis points. The following table illustrates operating income results of our business segments, including operating margin results for 2010 and 2009. (in millions) 2010 2009 Change Water Infrastructure $ 276 $ 227 21.6 % Applied Water 158 109 45.0 % Segment operating income 434 336 29.2 % Corporate and Other (46 ) (60 ) Total operating income $ 388 $ 276 40.6 % Operating margin: Water Infrastructure 14.3 % 13.7 % 60 bp Applied Water 11.9 % 8.7 % 320 bp Total Xylem 12.1 % 9.7 % 240 bp 41 Table of Contents Water Infrastructure Operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment increased $49 million or 21.6% for 2010 compared with 2009. This increase is primarily attributable to contributions from the Nova and Godwin acquisitions, which provided combined incremental operating income of $28 million during 2010. Operating productivity and lower restructuring expense more than offset incremental strategic investments, higher pension costs, and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. As a result, we saw operating margin expansion of 60 basis points over 2009. Applied Water Operating income for our Applied Water segment increased $49 million or 45.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the prior year. Operating productivity, including increased volume, increased price, benefits from our cost savings initiatives, and lower restructuring charges of $12 million more than offset incremental costs associated with strategic initiatives. Operating margin expansion of 320 basis points over 2009 was largely attributable to these same factors. Income Tax Expense In 2010 and 2009, we recorded an income tax provision of $59 million and $14 million, respectively, which represents effective tax rates of 15.2% and 5.0%, respectively. For 2010, the effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to a lower rate incurred on foreign earnings and the favorable impact of the repatriation of foreign earnings net of foreign tax credits. For 2009, the effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to a lower rate incurred on foreign earnings and the favorable impact of the restructuring of certain legal entities. During 2009, the Company implemented an international restructuring in which it transferred the ownership of its Canadian operations to its Luxembourg holding company. The transfer will allow the Company to recover, in a more tax efficient manner, the earnings and book to tax basis differences attributable to our Canadian investment. As a result, the Company reduced the deferred tax liability related to our investment in Canada. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the three years ended December 31, 2011. 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Operating activities $ 449 $ 395 $ 370 Investing activities (423 ) (1,093 ) (84 ) Financing activities 172 745 (292 ) Foreign exchange (11 ) 3 6 Net cash flow $ 187 $ 50 $ Sources and Uses of Liquidity Operating Activities During 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $449 million, compared to $395 million in 2010. The $54 million year over year increase is primarily the result of lower tax and restructuring payments. This increase was partially offset by net increased uses of cash in working capital driven by spending to support increased sales volumes. During 2010, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $25 million as compared to 2009, primarily attributable to a $88 million increase in net income, excluding non cash increases in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a reduced source of cash from working capital. 42 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $423 million for 2011, compared to $1,093 million in 2010 and $84 million in 2009. We invested $309 million related to the acquisition of YSI in 2011 and $385 million and $580 million related to the acquisitions of Nova and Godwin Pumps, respectively, in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2011 were $126 million compared to $94 million in 2010 and $62 million in 2009. The $32 million year over year increase in capital expenditures in 2011 is primarily due to investments to increase productivity and the expansion of the Godwin business. Financing Activities During 2011, cash provided by financing activities was $172 million, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $745 million in 2010 and cash used in financing activities of $292 million in 2009. The decline in 2011 is due to net transfers to our former parent, ITT, as the net proceeds from the issuance of $1.2 billion aggregate amount of senior notes (described below) funded a net cash transfer to ITT that included the repayment of funds used in the acquisition of YSI. In general, the components of net transfers include: (i) cash transfers from the Company to parent, (ii) cash investments from our parent used to fund operations, capital expenditures and acquisitions, (iii) charges (benefits) for income taxes, and (iv) allocations of the parent companys corporate expenses described in this Report. Dividends of $19 million were paid in 2011. No dividends were paid in 2010 and 2009. Funding and Liquidity Strategy Prior to the Spin off, the majority of our operations participated in U.S. and international cash management and funding arrangements managed by ITT where cash was swept from our balance sheet daily, and cash to meet our operating and investing needs was provided as needed from ITT. Transfers of cash both to and from these arrangements are reflected as a component of Parent company investment in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. The cash presented on our balance sheet prior to the Spin off consists primarily of U.S. and international cash from subsidiaries that do not participate in these arrangements. As a result of the separation, our capital structure and sources of liquidity changed significantly. We no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with ITT. Instead, our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, and access to the bank and capital markets. Historically, we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs centered on operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, and strategic investments. Subsequent to the separation, while our ability to forecast future cash flows is more limited, we expect to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and financing requirements through cash flows from operations via access to cash on hand and capital markets. If our cash flows from operations are less than we expect, we may need to incur debt or issue equity. From time to time we may need to access the long term and short term capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, and (iii) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. We cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all. We anticipate that our present sources of funds, including funds from operations and additional borrowings, will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our liquidity and capital needs in both the United States and outside of the United States over the next twelve months. On September 20, 2011, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, of which $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.55% Senior Notes will mature on September 20, 2016 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes will mature on October 1, 2021, the net proceeds of which funded a net cash transfer to ITT in connection with the Spin off with the balance used for general corporate 43 Table of Contents purposes. The Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The notes were initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by ITT. The guarantee terminated and was automatically and unconditionally released upon the distribution of the common stock of Xylem to the holders of ITTs common stock in connection with the separation. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2011 are as follows: Rating Agency Short Term Ratings Long Term Ratings Standard & Poors A 2 BBB Moodys Investors Service P 2 Baa2 Fitch Ratings F 2 BBB In connection with the Spin off, as of October 31, 2011, Xylem and its subsidiaries entered into a Four Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility provides for an aggregate principal amount of up to $600 million of (i) a competitive advance borrowing option which will be provided on an uncommitted competitive advance basis through an auction mechanism (the competitive loans), (ii) revolving extensions of credit (the revolving loans) outstanding at any time and (iii) the issuance of letters of credits in a face amount not in excess of $100 million outstanding at any time. As of December 31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. For the years ended 2011 and 2010, we generated approximately 64% and 65%, respectively, of our revenue from non U.S. operations. As we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the United States, we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from non U.S. operations and we expect our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries. We expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. We may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the U.S. and other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest all but $100 million of these funds outside of the United States. However, we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile, expected future cash generation and investment opportunities which support our current designation of these funds as being indefinitely reinvested and reassess whether there is a demonstrated need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our U.S. operations. If, as a result of our review, it is determined that all or a portion of the funds may be needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue U.S. taxes related to future tax payments associated with the repatriation of these funds. As of December 31, 2011, our foreign subsidiaries were holding $279 million in cash or marketable securities. As of December 31, 2011, our excess of financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries totaled $1.6 billion. We have not asserted that $100 million of our excess basis difference will be permanently reinvested and have therefore provided for United States or additional foreign withholding taxes for that portion. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2011: (in millions) 2012 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5+ Years Total Debt and capital lease obligations (1) $ 5 $ 1 $ $ 1,200 $ 1,206 Interest payments (2) 51 101 101 168 421 Operating lease obligations 139 218 117 211 685 Purchase obligations (3) 83 5 1 89 Postretirement benefits 31 61 70 194 356 Other long term obligations reflected on the balance sheet (4) 4 8 6 8 26 Total commitments $ 313 $ 394 $ 295 $ 1,781 $ 2,783 44 Table of Contents In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, we have recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $5 million. These amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing of such payments in individual years. (1) Refer to Note 8, Credit Facilities and Long Term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements. Amounts represent principal payments of long term debt including current maturities and exclude unamortized discounts. (2) Amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011. (3) Represents unconditional purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms to purchase goods or services, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase agreements that are cancellable without penalty have been excluded. (4) Other long term obligations include estimated environmental payments. We estimate, based on historical experience, that we will spend between $2 million and $4 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation. At December 31, 2011, we had estimated and accrued $15 million related to environmental matters. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011, we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries. We do not consider the maximum exposure to be material either individually or in the aggregate. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgments, include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from managements estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped, risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the contractual terms have been fulfilled. In instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance, revenue is recognized when either (i) we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or (ii) upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria. Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions. Where sales agreements contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions, 45 Table of Contents judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the transaction price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, the total revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of the deliverable to all other deliverables in the contract. Revenue for multiple element arrangements is recognized when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverable have been satisfied. The allocation of sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement. For delivered elements accounted for as separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value, there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized. Certain businesses enter into long term construction type sales contracts for which revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method based upon percentage of costs incurred to total costs. We record a reduction in revenue at the time of sale for estimated product returns, rebates and other allowances, based on historical experience and known trends. Warranty Accrual. Accruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold or services are rendered and are recorded as a component of cost of revenue. These accruals are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and consider any factors that may cause differences in expected future warranty costs as compared to historical claim experience. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, we base our estimated warranty obligation on product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities quarterly and adjust amounts as necessary. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits. We periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. The valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates. Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided U.S. taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the United States. We plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we will distribute to the United States and provide the U.S. federal taxes due on these amounts. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Furthermore, we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on 46 Table of Contents examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional tax expense would result. If a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We also review the carrying value of our finite lived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise. We conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter. We perform a two step impairment test for goodwill. In the first step, we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. In our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets, we compare the fair value of those assets to their carrying value. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives using an income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, particularly related to future operating results and cash flows. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data. In addition, the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in Note 15, Industry Segment and Geographic Data, to our notes to the consolidated financial statements, or one level below. The fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. Our 2011 annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated the estimated fair value of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment charges were recorded. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value estimates on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 100 basis point increase to the discount rates utilized, a ten percent reduction in expected future cash flows, and reduced the assumed future growth rates of each reporting unit by 100 basis points. These hypothetical changes did not result in any reporting unit failing step one of the impairment test. Further, our 2011 annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the assets exceeded their carrying value. Postretirement Plans. Prior to the Spin off, employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated in various retirement plans administered by ITT. In connection with the Spin off, we entered into a Benefit and Compensation Matters Agreement with ITT whereby Xylem agreed to adopt or assume sponsorship of certain defined benefit plans and replicate certain ITT defined contribution plans to allow for continuation of those benefits. Under this agreement, assets and liabilities attributable to Xylem employees were transferred from ITT to our qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans. 47 Table of Contents Company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit pension plans. The determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. These major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, health care inflation and termination (some of which are disclosed in Note 12, Postretirement Benefit Plans, in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements) and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants, or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants, over the average remaining life expectancy. Significant Assumptions Management develops each assumption using relevant Company experience, in conjunction with market related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. All assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as necessary. The table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2011 and 2010. 2011 2010 (a) U.S. Intl U.S. Intl Obligation Assumptions: Discount rate 4.87 % 4.76 % 5.83 % 5.18 % Rate of future compensation increase 4.50 % 3.58 % 4.00 % 3.40 % Cost Assumptions: Discount rate 5.83 % 5.53 % 6.00 % 5.55 % Expected long term rate of return on plan assets 9.00 % 7.34 % 9.00 % 7.20 % Rate of future compensation increase 4.50 % 3.37 % 4.00 % 3.41 % (a) Represents pre Spin off from ITT and does not include plans transferred from ITT upon Spin off. We determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. Specifically, the Company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over long term timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation, which is detailed in Note 12, Postretirement Benefit Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Based on the approach described above, the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected long term rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year. 2011 2010 (a) 2009 (a) Expected long term rate of return on plan assets 7.52 % 8.20 % 8.63 % Actual rate of return on plan assets (1.40 )% 15.34 % 33.96 % (a) Represents pre Spin off from ITT and does not include returns on plans transferred from ITT upon Spin off. For the recognition of net periodic pension cost, the calculation of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is generally derived using a market related value of plan assets based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years. The use of fair value, rather than a calculated value, could materially affect net periodic pension cost. Our weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets for all pension plans, effective January 1, 2012 is 7.42%. We estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by $1 million. The discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. We base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality 48 Table of Contents fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising AAA/AA bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plans actuaries. Annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single point discount rate matching the plans characteristics. Our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective January 1, 2012, is 4.77%. We estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by $1 million. The rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook. Effective January 1, 2012, our expected rate of future compensation is 3.65% for all pension plans. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than $1 million. The assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of health care (the health care trend rate) is 7.4% for 2012, decreasing ratably to 5% in 2019. An increase or decrease in the health care trend rates by one percent per year would not have a material effect on the benefit obligation or the aggregate annual service and interest components. To the extent that actual experience differs from these assumptions, the effect will be amortized over the average future service of the covered active employees. Funded Status Funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year end values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets. We estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately $20 million. Fair Value of Plan Assets The plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and foreign equity securities, interests in private equity and hedge funds, fixed income investments, insurance contracts, real estate, and cash and cash equivalents. A portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in private equity and hedge funds. The private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured at net asset value. However, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. Accordingly, we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. These adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. There were no adjustments recorded for these assets at December 31, 2011. Asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. We estimate that a 5% change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately $19 million. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. There were no new pronouncements which we expect to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by management. Our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs, revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiarys functional currency. Similarly, we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing. It is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. 49 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We may use derivative financial instruments to offset risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers, when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities. In January 2012, we began to periodically enter into currency forward contracts in order to manage the exchange rate fluctuation risk on certain intercompany transactions. Our principal currency exposures relate to the Euro, Swedish Krona, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Polish Zloty, and Hungarian Forint. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material to Xylems financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk As of December 31, 2011, we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our debt portfolio entirely comprises long term, fixed rate instruments. We do not account for our long term debt using the fair value option. Commodity Price Exposures Portions of our business are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as copper, nickel and aluminum, among others. Our primary exposure to this volatility resides with the use of these materials in purchased component parts. We generally maintain long term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts; however, we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in prices for raw metal commodities would not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 50 Table of Contents
