Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "TRICON" or the "Company") is comprised of the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell ("the Concepts") and is the worlds largest quick service restaurant ("QSR") company based on the number of system units. Separately, each brand ranks in the top ten among QSR chains in U.S. system sales and units. Our 10,927 international units make us the second largest QSR company outside the U.S. TRICON became an independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the "Spin off Date") via a tax free distribution of our Common Stock (the "Distribution" or "Spin off") to the shareholders of our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo"). TRICON has numerous registered trademarks and service marks. We believe that many of these marks, including our Kentucky Fried Chicken&reg;, KFC&reg;, Pizza Hut&reg; and Taco Bell&reg; trademarks, have significant value and are materially important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of important trademarks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks. From time to time we may become involved in litigation to defend and protect our use of such registered marks. The use of our trademarks by franchisees and licensees has been authorized in KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchise and license agreements. Under current law and with proper use, our rights in trademarks can generally last indefinitely. We also have certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while valuable, are not material to our business. Throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A"), we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net loss (gain), unusual items income (expense) and our accounting and human resources policy changes in 1999 (the "1999 accounting changes"). See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions. We use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally and as the base to forecast future performance. Ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In 2001, our international business, Tricon Restaurants International ("TRI" or "International") accounted for 35% of system sales, 31% of revenues and 31% of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange net loss. We anticipate that, despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations, we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 37 through 73 and the Cautionary Statements on page 36. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 42 through 73. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. 17 Critical Accounting Policies Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that required us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. We believe that our most significant policies require: Estimation of cash flows associated with the disposition of restaurants, and the impairment of long lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. See Note 2 for a further discussion. Determination of the appropriate allowances and reserves associated with franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities. See Note 2 for a discussion of the allowance for uncollectible franchise and license receivables and Note 22 for a discussion of franchise contingent liabilities. Estimation, using actuarially determined methods, of our self insured losses under our property and casualty loss programs. See Note 22 for a discussion of our insurance programs. Determination of the appropriate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and reserves for potential tax exposures. See Note 20 for a discussion of income taxes. Factors Affecting Comparability of 2001 Results to 2000 Results Impact of AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process See Note 22 for a discussion of the impact of the AmeriServe Food Distribution, Inc. ("AmeriServe") bankruptcy reorganization process on the Company. Franchisee Financial Condition Like others in the QSR industry, from time to time, some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations. During 2001 and 2000, certain of our franchise operators, principally in the Taco Bell system experienced varying degrees of financial problems. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation, and in the absence of an improvement in the franchisees business trends, there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues. These include a sale of some or all of the operators restaurants to us or a third party, a restructuring of the operators business and or finances, or, in the more unusual cases, bankruptcy of the operator. It is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues. Through February 11, 2002, restructurings have been completed for approximately 1,000 Taco Bell franchise restaurants. In connection with these restructurings, Taco Bell has acquired 123 restaurants for approximately $65 million through December 29, 2001. In addition to these acquisitions, Taco Bell purchased 19 restaurants from franchisees for approximately $12 million and simultaneously leased the restaurants back to these franchisees under long term leases. As part of the restructurings, Taco Bell has committed to fund approximately $29 million of future franchise capital expenditures, principally through leasing arrangements. In the fourth quarter of 2000, Taco Bell established a $15 million loan program to assist certain franchisees. All fundings had been advanced by the end of the first quarter of 2001, and the resulting notes receivable are primarily included in Other assets. We believe that the recent improvement in business trends at Taco Bell has helped alleviate financial problems in the Taco Bell franchise system which were due to past downturns in sales. Accordingly, though we continue to monitor this situation, we expect restructurings of the remaining Taco Bell franchise restaurants with financial issues to be significantly less in number and costs in 2002. 18 In 2001 and 2000, the Company charged expenses of $18 million and $26 million, respectively, to ongoing operating profit related to allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables. These costs are reported as franchise and license expenses. On an ongoing basis, we assess our exposure from franchise related risks, which include estimated uncollectibility of franchise and license receivables, contingent lease liabilities, guarantees to support certain third party financial arrangements of franchisees and potential claims by franchisees. The contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the Contingent Liabilities section of Note 22. Although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time, we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure as of December 29, 2001. It is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs; however, these cost are not expected to be material to quarterly or annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Unusual Items (Income) Expense We recorded unusual items income of $3 million in 2001 and unusual items expense of $204 million in 2000 and $51 million in 1999. See Note 5 for a detailed discussion of our unusual items (income) expense. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded expenses of approximately $4 million related to streamlining certain support functions, which included the termination of approximately 90 employees. The reserves established, which primarily related to severance, were almost fully utilized in the first quarter of 2002. We expect to incur additional costs of approximately $2 million in 2002 related to these actions, which will be expensed as incurred. Beginning in 2002, we anticipate savings in general and administrative expenses ("G&A") of approximately $6 million per year, primarily related to reduced compensation. However, we expect to reinvest a substantial portion of these savings in our growth initiatives, including multibranding. Impact of New Unconsolidated Affiliates Consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets, we formed new ventures in Canada and Poland with our largest franchisee in each market. The venture in Canada was formed in the third quarter of 2000 and the venture in Poland was effective in the first quarter of 2001. The Canadian venture operates over 700 stores and the Poland venture operates approximately 100 stores. We did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to these new ventures. Previously, the results from the restaurants we contributed to these ventures were consolidated. The impact of these transactions on operating results is similar to the impact of our refranchising activities, which is described in the Store Portfolio Strategy section below. Consequently, these transactions resulted in a decline in our Company sales, restaurant margin dollars and G&A as well as higher franchise fees. We also record equity income (losses) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates ("equity income") and, in Canada, higher franchise fees since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to the venture. The formation of these ventures did not have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in 2001. Impact of the Consolidation of an Unconsolidated Affiliate At the beginning of 2001, we consolidated a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate. This change resulted in higher Company sales, restaurant margin dollars and G&A as well as decreased franchise fees and equity income. This previously unconsolidated affiliate operates over 100 stores. 19 Fifty third Week in 2000 Our fiscal calendar results in a fifty third week every 5 or 6 years. Fiscal year 2000 included a fifty third week in the fourth quarter. The estimated favorable impact in net income was $10 million or $0.07 per diluted share in 2000. The following table summarizes the estimated favorable/(unfavorable) impact of the fifty third week on system sales, revenues and ongoing operating profit: U.S. International Unallocated Total System sales $ 230 $ 65 $ $ 295 Revenues Company sales $ 58 $ 18 $ $ 76 Franchise fees 9 2 11 Total revenues $ 67 $ 20 $ $ 87 Ongoing operating profit Franchise fees $ 9 $ 2 $ $ 11 Restaurant margin 11 4 15 General and administrative expenses (3) (2) (2) (7) Ongoing operating profit $ 17 $ 4 $ (2) $ 19 Store Portfolio Strategy Since 1995, we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of key U.S. and International markets. This portfolio balancing activity has reduced our reported revenues and restaurant profits and has increased the importance of system sales as a key performance measure. We substantially completed our refranchising program in 2001. The following table summarizes our refranchising activities: 2001 2000 1999 Number of units refranchised 233 757 1,435 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 111 $ 381 $ 916 Refranchising net gains, pre tax(a) $ 39 $ 200 $ 422 2001 includes $12 million of previously deferred refranchising gains and a charge of $11 million to mark to market the net assets of the Singapore business, which is held for sale. In addition to our refranchising program, we have been closing restaurants over the past several years. Restaurants closed include poor performing restaurants, restaurants that are relocated to a new site within the same trade area or U.S. Pizza Hut delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dine in traditional store within the same trade area. 20 The following table summarizes Company store closure activities: 2001 2000 1999 Number of units closed 270 208 301 Store closure costs(a) $ 17 $ 10 $ 13 Impairment charges for stores to be closed $ 5 $ 6 $ 12 Includes favorable adjustments to our 1997 fourth quarter charge of $9 million in 1999. See Note 5 for a discussion of these adjustments. The impact on ongoing operating profit arising from our refranchising and store closure initiatives as well as the contribution of Company stores to new unconsolidated affiliates as described in the Impact of New Unconsolidated Affiliates section represents the net of (a) the estimated reduction in Company sales, restaurant margin and G&A; (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees; and (c) the estimated change in equity income. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising, store closures and the contribution of Company stores to unconsolidated affiliates: 2001 U.S. International Worldwide Reduced sales $ (483) $ (243) $ (726) Increased franchise fees 21 13 34 Reduction in total revenues $ (462) $ (230) $ (692) 2000 U.S. International Worldwide Reduced sales $ (838) $ (246) $ (1,084) Increased franchise fees 39 13 52 Reduction in total revenues $ (799) $ (233) $ (1,032) The following table summarizes the estimated impact on ongoing operating profit of refranchising, store closures and the contribution of Company stores to unconsolidated affiliates: 2001 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant margin $ (67) $ (25) $ (92) Increased franchise fees 21 13 34 Decreased G&A 5 13 18 Decreased equity income (5) (5) Decrease in ongoing operating profit $ (41) $ (4) $ (45) 2000 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant margin $ (90) $ (25) $ (115) Increased franchise fees 39 13 52 Decreased G&A 11 6 17 Decreased equity income (1) (1) Decrease in ongoing operating profit $ (40) $ (7) $ (47) 21 Worldwide Results of Operations % B(W) % B(W) 2001 vs. 2000 2000 vs. 1999 System sales(a) $ 22,328 1 $ 22,159 2 Company sales $ 6,138 (3) $ 6,305 (11) Franchise and license fees 815 3 788 9 Revenues $ 6,953 (2) $ 7,093 (9) Company restaurant margin $ 906 (5) $ 954 (13) % of Company sales 14.8% (0.3) ppts. 15.1% (0.3) ppts.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, system sales increased 5%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. System sales increased $397 million or 2% in 2000, after a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the fifty third week, system sales increased 1%. This increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures and same store sales declines. Worldwide Revenues Company sales decreased $167 million or 3% in 2001, after a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, Company sales were flat. An increase due to new unit development was offset by refranchising. Company sales decreased $794 million or 11% in 2000. Excluding the favorable impact from the fifty third week, Company sales decreased 12%. The decrease was primarily due to refranchising, store closures, the contribution of Company stores to a new unconsolidated affiliate and same store sales declines. This decrease was partially offset by new unit development. Franchise and license fees increased $27 million or 3% in 2001, after a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, franchise and license fees increased 7%. The increase was driven by new unit development, units acquired from us and same store sales growth. This increase was partially offset by store closures. Franchise and license fees increased $65 million or 9% in 2000. The increase was primarily driven by units acquired from us and new unit development partially offset by store closures and same store sales declines in the U.S. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was essentially offset by the favorable impact of the fifty third week. Worldwide Company Restaurant Margin 2001 2000 1999 Company sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Food and paper 31.1 30.8 31.5 Payroll and employee benefits 27.1 27.7 27.6 Occupancy and other operating expenses 27.0 26.4 25.5 Company restaurant margin 14.8% 15.1% 15.4% Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 30 basis points in 2001. U.S. restaurant margin was flat and International restaurant margin declined approximately 120 basis points. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 25 basis points in 2000, including the unfavorable impact of 15 basis points from lapping the 1999 accounting changes. U.S. restaurant margin declined approximately 55 basis points and International restaurant margin increased approximately 65 basis points. 23 Worldwide General And Administrative Expenses G&A decreased $34 million or 4% in 2001. Excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, G&A decreased 3%. The decrease was driven by lower corporate and project spending, the formation of unconsolidated affiliates and refranchising. The decrease was partially offset by higher compensation costs. G&A decreased $65 million or 7% in 2000. Excluding the unfavorable impact from lapping the 1999 accounting changes, G&A decreased 9%. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and Year 2000 costs as well as the favorable impact of refranchising and store closures. Reduced spending on conferences also contributed to the decline. G&A included Year 2000 spending of approximately $2 million in 2000 as compared to approximately $30 million in 1999. Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses increased $10 million or 20% in 2001. The increase was primarily due to support costs related to the financial restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees. The increase was partially offset by lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables. Franchise and license expenses increased $24 million or 93% in 2000. The increase was driven by allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables, principally at Taco Bell. Worldwide Other (Income) Expense 2001 2000 1999 Equity income $ (26) $ (25) $ (19) Foreign exchange net loss 3 3 Other (income) expense $ (23) $ (25) $ (16) Equity income increased $1 million or 3% in 2001, after a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by improved results of our unconsolidated affiliate in the United Kingdom. The increase was offset by equity losses from Poland and the consolidation of a previously unconsolidated affiliate. Equity income increased $6 million or 32% in 2000. The increase was primarily due to improved results of our unconsolidated affiliates in Japan, the United Kingdom and China. Worldwide Facility Actions Net Loss (Gain) We recorded facility actions net loss of $1 million in 2001 and facility actions net gain of $176 million in 2000 and $381 million in 1999. See the Store Portfolio Strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and Note 5 for a summary of the components of facility actions net loss (gain) by reportable operating segment. 24 Worldwide Ongoing Operating Profit % B(W) vs. % B(W) vs. 2001 2000 2000 1999 United States $ 722 (3) $ 742 (9) International 318 3 309 16 Unallocated and corporate expenses (148) 9 (163) 16 Foreign exchange net loss (3) NM NM Ongoing operating profit $ 889 $ 888 1 The changes in U.S. and International ongoing operating profit for 2001 and 2000 are discussed in the respective sections. Unallocated and corporate expenses decreased $15 million or 9% in 2001. Excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, G&A decreased 8%. The decline was primarily due to lower corporate and project spending partially offset by higher incentive and deferred compensation. Excluding the unfavorable impact from lapping the 1999 accounting changes, unallocated and corporate expenses decreased $31 million or 16% in 2000. The decline was primarily due to lower Year 2000 spending and lower incentive compensation expense. Worldwide Interest Expense, Net 2001 2000 1999 Interest expense $ 172 $ 190 $ 218 Interest income (14) (14) (16) Interest expense, net $ 158 $ 176 $ 202 Net interest expense decreased $18 million or 10% in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average interest rates. Net interest expense decreased $26 million or 13% in 2000. The decline was due to lower average debt outstanding in 2000 as compared to 1999, partially offset by an increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt. As discussed in Note 22, interest expense on incremental borrowings related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process of $9 million has been included in unusual items expense in 2000. Worldwide Income Taxes 2001 2000 1999 Reported Income taxes $ 241 $ 271 $ 411 Effective tax rate 32.8% 39.6% 39.5% Ongoing(a) Income taxes $ 243 $ 268 $ 267 Effective tax rate 33.1% 37.7% 39.3% Excludes the effects of facility actions net (loss) gain, unusual items (income) expense and the 1999 accounting changes. See Note 5 for a discussion of these items. 25 The following table reconciles the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to our ongoing effective tax rate: 2001 2000 1999 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 1.9 1.8 2.3 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations 0.2 (0.4) 4.6 Adjustments relating to prior years (2.2) 5.3 (0.7) Valuation allowance reversals (1.7) (4.0) (2.0) Other, net (0.1) 0.1 Ongoing effective tax rate 33.1% 37.7% 39.3% The 2001 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 4.6 percentage points to 33.1%. The decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to prior years, partially offset by reduced valuation allowance reversals. See Note 20 for a discussion of valuation allowances. In 2001, the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate because losses of foreign operations for which no benefit could be currently recognized and other adjustments more than offset the effect of claiming credit against our U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid. The 2000 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 1.6 percentage points to 37.7%. The decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the tax on our international operations, including the initial benefits of becoming eligible in 2000 to claim substantially all of our available foreign income tax credits for foreign taxes paid in 2000 against our U.S. income tax liability, and incremental valuation allowance reversals. This decrease was partially offset by adjustments relating to prior years. In 2000, the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to our ability to claim credit against our U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid. The effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations in 1999 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. This was primarily due to foreign tax rate differentials, including foreign withholding tax paid without benefit of the related foreign tax credit for U.S. income tax purposes and losses of foreign operations for which no tax benefit could be currently recognized.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, system sales increased 2%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth at KFC and Pizza Hut, partially offset by store closures. System sales were flat in 2000. Excluding the favorable impact of the fifty third week, system sales decreased 2%. The decrease was due to same stores sales declines at Taco Bell and KFC as well as store closures, partially offset by new unit development. U.S. Revenues Company sales decreased $246 million or 5% in 2001. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, Company sales decreased 4%. The decrease was driven by refranchising, partially offset by new unit development. 27 For 2001, blended Company same store sales for our three Concepts were up 1% on a comparable fifty two week basis. An increase in the average guest check was partially offset by transaction declines. Same store sales at KFC were up 3%, primarily due to an increase in transactions. Same store sales at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell were flat. A 2% increase in the average guest check at Pizza Hut and a 3% increase in the average guest check at Taco Bell were both fully offset by transaction declines. Company sales decreased $720 million or 14% in 2000. Excluding the favorable impact of the fifty third week, Company sales decreased 15%. The decrease was primarily due to refranchising, store closures and same store sales declines. The decrease was partially offset by new unit development. For 2000, blended Company same store sales for our three Concepts decreased 2% on a comparable basis. A decline in transactions was partially offset by an increase in the average guest check. Same store sales at Pizza Hut increased 1%. A 3% increase in the average guest check was partially offset by transaction declines. Same store sales at KFC decreased 3%, primarily due to transaction declines. Same store sales at Taco Bell decreased 5% as a result of transaction declines. Franchise and license fees grew $11 million or 2% in 2001. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, franchise and license fees increased 4%. The increase was driven by units acquired from us and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. Franchise and license fees increased $34 million or 7% in 2000. Excluding the favorable impact from the fifty third week, franchise and license fees increased 5%. The increase was driven by units acquired from us and new unit development, partially offset by same store sales declines and store closures.

Favorable pricing and product mix was offset by increases in occupancy and other costs, product costs and wage rates. The increase in product costs was primarily driven by cheese costs. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 55 basis points in 2000, including a decline of approximately 25 basis points resulting from lapping the 1999 accounting changes. The remaining decrease primarily resulted from a shift to lower margin chicken sandwiches at KFC, volume declines at Taco Bell and the absence of favorable 1999 insurance related adjustments. The decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of refranchising and pricing and product mix. Favorable product costs, primarily cheese, were almost fully offset by higher occupancy and other costs and higher wage rates. U.S. Ongoing Operating Profit Ongoing operating profit decreased $20 million or 3% in 2001. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, ongoing operating profit decreased 1%. The decrease was driven by the unfavorable impact of refranchising and store closures, higher restaurant operating costs and higher franchise support costs related to the restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees. The decrease was partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix and new unit development. 28 Ongoing operating profit decreased $71 million or 9% in 2000. Excluding the favorable impact of the fifty third week, ongoing operating profit decreased 12%. The decrease was primarily due to same store sales declines, the unfavorable impact of refranchising and store closures and higher restaurant operating costs. The decrease was partially offset by new unit development and reduced G&A expenses. The decrease in G&A expenses was largely due to lower incentive compensation, decreased professional fees and lower spending on conferences at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. The G&A declines were partially offset by higher franchise related expenses, primarily allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, system sales increased 9%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. System sales increased $399 million or 6% in 2000, after a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the fifty third week, system sales increased 7%. This increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. International Revenues Company sales increased $79 million or 5% in 2001, after a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, Company sales increased 11%. The increase was driven by new unit development and acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees. The increase was partially offset by the contribution of Company stores to new unconsolidated affiliates. Company sales decreased $74 million or 4% in 2000, after a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the fifty third week, Company sales decreased 2%. The decrease was primarily due to refranchising, the contribution of Company stores to an unconsolidated affiliate and store closures. The decrease was partially offset by new unit development and same store sales growth. Franchise and license fees increased $16 million or 6% in 2001, after a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, franchise and license fees increased 13%. The increase was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and units contributed to unconsolidated affiliates. The increase was partially offset by store closures. Franchise and license fees increased approximately $31 million or 14% in 2000, after a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact from the fifty third week, franchise and license fees increased 16%. The increase was driven by new unit development, units acquired from us and same store sales growth. The increase was partially offset by store closures.

This decrease was primarily attributable to higher operating costs and the acquisition of below average margin stores from franchisees. The decrease was partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased 65 basis points in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of refranchising, the contribution of Company stores with below average margins to a new unconsolidated affiliate and store closures. 30 International Ongoing Operating Profit Ongoing operating profit increased $9 million or 3%, after a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, ongoing operating profit increased 12%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs. Ongoing operating profit increased $44 million or 16% in 2000, after a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the fifty third week, ongoing operating profit increased 16%. The increase was primarily due to new unit development. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities increased $341 million to $832 million. The increase was primarily due to the collection of receivables established in 2000 and the absence of the unusual charges taken in 2000 related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. Excluding the AmeriServe related items, cash provided by operating activities was $704 million versus $734 million in 2000. See Note 22 for a discussion of the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. In 2000, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $74 million to $491 million. The decrease was primarily due to unusual charges related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process and the related use of working capital. The primary driver of the net use of working capital was an increase in receivables arising from the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, which resulted in a net use of working capital of approximately $135 million. Excluding these AmeriServe related items, cash from operating activities increased by $143 million to $734 million. This increase was driven by a lower reduction of our working capital deficit than in 1999. Our working capital deficit, excluding cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and short term borrowings, is typical of restaurant operations where a majority of sales are for cash while payment to suppliers carry longer payment terms, generally from 10 30 days. The lower working capital deficit reduction in 2000 is the result of refranchising significantly fewer restaurants in 2000 versus 1999, partially offset by a change in payment terms in our food and supply distribution agreement from 30 to 15 days. Net cash used in investing activities was $503 million versus $237 million in 2000. The increase in cash used was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants in 2001 and increased acquisition and capital spending. The increase was partially offset by lapping the funding of a debtor in possession revolving credit facility to AmeriServe in 2000. In 2000, net cash used in investing activities was $237 million versus net cash provided of $522 million in 1999. The decline in cash flow from investing activities was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants to franchisees in 2000 versus 1999, increased capital spending related to development and funding of a debtor in possession revolving credit facility to AmeriServe. Although we report gross proceeds in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also consider refranchising proceeds on an "after tax" basis. We define after tax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities (primarily accounts payable and property taxes) related to the units refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains. The after tax proceeds can be used to pay down debt or repurchase shares. After tax proceeds were approximately $90 million in 2001 which reflects a 65% decrease from 2000. This decrease was due to the refranchising of fewer restaurants in 2001 versus 2000. After tax proceeds were approximately $261 million in 2000, a 62% decrease versus 1999. This decrease was also due to refranchising fewer restaurants in 2000 than 1999. 31 Net cash used in financing activities was $352 million compared to $207 million in 2000. The increase in cash used is primarily due to higher repayment of debt partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in 2001 compared to 2000. In 2000, net cash used in financing activities decreased to $207 million versus $1.1 billion in 1999 due to lower debt repayments. Less cash was available for financing activities in 2000 due to lower cash flow from operating and investing activities, as described above. In February 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program. This program authorizes us to repurchase, through February 14, 2003, up to $300 million of our outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees). During 2001, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for approximately $100 million. See Note 19 for a discussion of the share repurchase program. In 1999, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees). This share repurchase program was completed in 2000. During 2000, we repurchased over 6.4 million shares for approximately $216 million. See Note 19 for a discussion of the share repurchase program. Financing Activities As more fully discussed in Note 12, our primary bank credit agreement, as amended, is comprised of a senior, unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $1.75 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, which was reduced from $3 billion as part of the amendment discussed below (collectively referred to as the "Credit Facilities"). The Credit Facilities mature on October 2, 2002. At December 29, 2001, we had unused Revolving Credit Facility borrowings available aggregating $2.7 billion, net of outstanding letters of credit of $0.2 billion. Amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities of $536 million at December 29, 2001 have been classified as short term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the October 2002 maturity. We are currently in negotiations to replace the Credit Facilities prior to the maturity date with new borrowings, which will reflect the market conditions and terms available at that time. The Credit Facilities subject us to certain mandatory principal repayment obligations, including prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement. Interest on the Credit Facilities is based principally on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a variable margin factor; therefore, our borrowing costs fluctuate depending upon the volatility in LIBOR. On February 22, 2002, we entered into an agreement to amend certain terms of our Credit Facilities. This amendment provides for, among other things, additional flexibility with respect to acquisitions and other investments. In addition, we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $3.0 billion to $1.75 billion. As a result of this amendment, we capitalized debt costs of approximately $1.5 million. These costs will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the Credit Facilities. We issued $850 million of unsecured Notes in 2001. The issuance included $200 million of 8.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2006 and $650 million of 8.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due April 15, 2011. We used the proceeds, net of issuance costs, to reduce amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities. We still have $550 million available for issuance under a $2 billion shelf registration. See Note 12 for further discussion. We use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, to lower interest expense and manage our exposure to interest rate risk. See Notes 2 and 14 as well as our market risk disclosure for further discussion of our interest rate risk. 32 Consolidated Financial Condition Assets increased $239 million or 6% to $4.4 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in property, plant and equipment driven by capital spending and acquisitions in excess of depreciation, refranchising and disposition of assets. The fair value of derivatives recorded as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in net receivables primarily related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. Liabilities decreased $187 million or 4% to $4.3 billion. The decrease was primarily attributable to net paydown of debt, partially offset by increases related to the adoption of SFAS 133. Liquidity Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited TRICON investment in operating assets. Typically, our cash flows include a significant amount of discretionary capital spending. Though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations, we believe our operating cash flows and our ability to adjust discretionary capital spending and borrow funds will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2002 and beyond. Significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 29, 2001 due by year include: Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Thereafter Total Long term debt(a) $ 537 $ 2 $ 551 $ 900 $ 1,990 Short term borrowings 151 151 Debt excluding capital leases 688 2 551 900 2,141 Operating leases(b) 221 383 294 893 1,791 Capital leases(b) 11 22 17 87 137 Franchisee financing obligations 15 14 29 Contractual obligations $ 935 $ 421 $ 862 $ 1,880 $ 4,098 Excludes the derivative instrument adjustment, which is discussed in Note 14. These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to operating and capital leases for approximately 4,400 restaurants. See Note 12 for a discussion of short term borrowings and long term debt and Note 13 for a discussion of leases. 33 In addition, we have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. As of December 29, 2001, the maximum exposure under these commercial commitments, which are shown on a nominal basis, include: Contingent liabilities associated with lease assignments $ 435 Standby letters of credit(a) 204 Guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates debt 12 Other commercial commitments 44 Includes $32 million related to guarantees of financial arrangements of franchisees, which are supported by stand by letters of credit. See Notes 12 and 22 for a further discussion of these commitments. Our unconsolidated affiliates also have long term debt outstanding. As of December 29, 2001 this debt totaled approximately $134 million, our share of which was approximately $68 million. As noted above, we have guaranteed $12 million of this total debt obligation. Our unconsolidated affiliates had total assets of over $900 million as of year end 2001 and total revenues of approximately $1.6 billion in 2001. Other Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Expected to Impact 2002 Ongoing Operating Profit Comparisons with 2001 Euro Conversion Twelve of the fifteen member countries of the European Economic and Monetary Union adopted the Euro as a common legal currency. We have Company and franchise businesses in the adopting member countries. Beginning January 1, 2002, new Euro denominated bills and coins were issued, and a transition period of two months began. During the transition period local currencies were removed from circulation. We took actions to mitigate our risks related to the Euro conversion efforts including the rollout of Euro ready point of sale ("POS") equipment and back of house hardware and software. We have not experienced any significant issues or unexpected business problems resulting from the Euro conversion. Given the absence of any significant problems to date, we do not expect Euro conversion issues to have a material adverse effect on TRICONs operations or financial results in 2002. Expenditures associated with our conversion efforts totaled approximately $5 million of which $3 million was incurred during 2001. Approximately 30% of these costs related to capital expenditures for new POS equipment and back of house hardware and software. The remaining expenditures were mainly related to consulting expenses for initial impact studies and head office accounting systems. We do not expect to incur significant Euro related expenditures in 2002. Consumer acceptance of the Euro has not significantly impacted our business to date. From a competitive perspective, we continue to assess the impact of product price transparency, potential revisions to our product bundling strategies, and the creation of Euro friendly price points. We do not believe that these activities will have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. 34 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates, principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of $4 million and $19 million, respectively, in annual income before taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 would decrease approximately $5 million and $11 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 would decrease approximately $72 million and $25 million, respectively. The significant change in the decrease of the fair market value between 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to the additional Senior Unsecured Notes issued in 2001. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk International ongoing operating profit constituted approximately 31% and 29% of our 2001 and 2000 ongoing operating profit, respectively, excluding unallocated and corporate expenses and foreign exchange net loss. In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1 billion and $900 million as of December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, respectively. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific and Europe. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our risk exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated. On a limited basis, we utilize forward contracts in order to reduce our risk exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated cash flows from royalties. There were no such forward contracts outstanding as of December 29, 2001. 35 Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a limited basis, commodity future and option contracts. There were no commodity future and option contracts outstanding at December 29, 2001, and those outstanding at December 30, 2000, were not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cautionary Statements From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements, we present "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The statements include those identified by such words as "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "plan" and other similar terminology. These "forward looking statements" reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements. Actual results involve risks and uncertainties, including both those specific to the Company and those specific to the industry, and could differ materially from expectations. Company risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, potentially substantial tax contingencies related to the Spin off, which, if they occur, require us to indemnify PepsiCo, Inc.; our substantial debt leverage and the attendant potential restriction on our ability to borrow in the future, as well as our substantial interest expense and principal repayment obligations; our ability to replace or refinance the Credit Facilities at reasonable rates; potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities including the liabilities related to the sale of the non core businesses; our ability to secure alternative distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores; our ability to complete our Euro conversion plans or the ability of our key suppliers to be Euro compliant; the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees; volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies. Industry risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, global and local business, economic and political conditions; legislation and governmental regulation; competitor activities; success of operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts; volatility of commodity costs; increases in minimum wage and other operating costs; availability and cost of land and construction; consumer preferences, spending patterns and demographic trends; political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates. 36
