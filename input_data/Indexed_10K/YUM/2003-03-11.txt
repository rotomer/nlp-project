Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction On May 16, 2002, TRICON Global Restaurants, Inc. changed its name to YUM! Brands, Inc. in order to better reflect our expanding portfolio of brands. In addition, on the same day, Tricon Restaurants International changed its name to YUM! Restaurants International. YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as YUM or the Company) comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers (LJS) and A&W All American Food Restaurants (A&W) (collectively the Concepts) and is the worlds largest quick service restaurant (QSR) company based on the number of system units. LJS and A&W were added when YUM acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. (YGR) on May 7, 2002. Separately, KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell rank in the top ten among QSR chains in U.S. system sales and units. With 11,798 international units, YUM is the second largest QSR company outside the U.S. YUM became an independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the Spin off Date) via a tax free distribution of our Common Stock (the Distribution or Spin off) to the shareholders of our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo). Throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net loss (gain) and unusual items income (expense). See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions. We use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. Ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All references to per share and share amounts in the following MD&A have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split distributed on June 17, 2002. In 2002, our international business, YUM! Restaurants International (YRI or International) accounted for 35% of system sales, 31% of revenues and 32% of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses. We anticipate that, despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations, we will continue to invest in certain international markets with substantial growth potential. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 41 through 79 and the Cautionary Statements on pages 39 and 40. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 46 through 79. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Critical Accounting Policies Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgements could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. 17 Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level. Restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant). Our semi annual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. These impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant, which can be for a period of over 20 years, and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the long lived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is our cost of capital, adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist. When it is probable that we will sell a restaurant we write down the restaurant to its fair value. We often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform impairment evaluations at the group level. Fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs. Estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary. In addition, we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting units over twenty years plus an expected terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit. We impaired $5 million of goodwill during 2002 related to our Pizza Hut France reporting unit. For the remainder of our reporting units with goodwill, the fair value is generally significantly in excess of the recorded carrying value. Thus, we do not believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given current business performance. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill. 18 Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables and Contingent Liabilities We reserve a franchisees or licensees entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 28, 2002. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. Primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts, we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees. We record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable. At December 28, 2002, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with $278 million representing the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 28, 2002, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts. See Note 24 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees. Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty claims. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 24 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves At December 28, 2002, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $137 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $176 million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. The estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes. Factors Affecting Comparability of 2002 Results to 2001 Results and 2001 Results to 2000 Results YGR Acquisition On May 7, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of YGR, the parent company of LJS and A&W. See Note 4 for a discussion of the acquisition. 19 As of the date of the acquisition, YGR consisted of 742 and 496 company and franchise LJS units, respectively, and 127 and 742 company and franchise A&W units, respectively. In addition, 133 multibranded LJS/A&W restaurants were included in the LJS unit totals. Except as discussed in certain sections of the MD&A, the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in 2002 was not significant. Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), in its entirety. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 142, we ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of December 30, 2001. The following table summarizes the favorable effect of SFAS 142 on restaurant profit, restaurant margin and ongoing operating profit had SFAS 142 been effective in 2001. Year Ended December 29, 2001 U.S. International Worldwide Restaurant profit $ 21 $ 11 $32 Restaurant margin (%) 0.5 0.6 0.5 Ongoing operating profit $ 22 $ 16 $38 Additionally, if SFAS 142 had been effective in 2001, reported net income would have increased approximately $26 million and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) would have increased $0.09. Unusual Items (Income) Expense We recorded unusual items income of $27 million in 2002 and $3 million in 2001 and unusual items expense of $204 million in 2000. See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of our unusual items (income) expense. Impact of New Unconsolidated Affiliates Consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets, we formed ventures in Canada and Poland with our largest franchisee in each market. The venture in Canada was formed in the third quarter of 2000 and the venture in Poland was effective in the first quarter of 2001. At the date of formation, the Canadian venture operated over 700 stores and the Poland venture operated approximately 100 stores. We did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to these new ventures. Previously, the results from the restaurants we contributed to these ventures were consolidated. The impact of these transactions on operating results is similar to the impact of our refranchising activities, which is described in the Store Portfolio Strategy section below. Consequently, these transactions resulted in a decline in our Company sales, restaurant margin dollars and general and administrative (G&A) expenses as well as higher franchise fees. We also record equity income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates (equity income) and, in Canada, higher franchise fees since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to the venture. The formation of these ventures did not have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in 2001. 20 Store Portfolio Strategy Since 1995, we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve the restaurants overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of key U.S. and International markets. This portfolio balancing activity reduces our reported revenues and restaurant profits, which increases the importance of system sales as a key performance measure. We substantially completed our U.S. refranchising program in 2001. The following table summarizes our refranchising activities: 2002 2001 2000 Number of units refranchised 174 233 757 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 81 $111 $381 Refranchising net gains, pre tax(a) $ 19 $ 39 $200 (a) 2001 includes $12 million of previously deferred refranchising gains and a charge of $11 million to mark to market the net assets of our Singapore business, which was sold during 2002 at a price approximately equal to its carrying value. In addition to our refranchising program, we have closed certain restaurants over the past several years. Restaurants closed include poor performing restaurants, restaurants relocated to a new site within the same trade area or U.S. Pizza Hut delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dine in traditional store within the same trade area. The following table summarizes Company store closure activities: 2002 2001 2000 Number of units closed 224 270 208 Store closure costs $ 15 $ 17 $ 10 Impairment charges for stores to be closed $ 9 $ 5 $ 6 The impact on ongoing operating profit arising from our refranchising and store closure initiatives as well as the contribution of Company stores to new unconsolidated affiliates is the net of (a) the estimated reduction in Company sales, restaurant profit and G&A expenses; (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised; and (c) the estimated change in equity income (loss). The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. 21 The following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising, Company store closures and, in 2001, the contribution of Company stores to unconsolidated affiliates: 2002 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased sales $ (214 ) $ (90 ) $ (304 ) Increased franchise fees 4 4 8 Decrease in total revenues $ (210 ) $ (86 ) $ (296 ) 2001 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased sales $ (483 ) $ (243 ) $ (726 ) Increased franchise fees 21 13 34 Decrease in total revenues $ (462 ) $ (230 ) $ (692 ) The following table summarizes the estimated impact on ongoing operating profit of refranchising, Company store closures and, in 2001, the contribution of Company stores to unconsolidated affiliates: 2002 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant margin $(23 ) $(5 ) $(28 ) Increased franchise fees 4 4 8 Decreased G&A 1 2 3 (Decrease) increase in ongoing operating profit $(18 ) $ 1 $(17 ) 2001 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant margin $(67 ) $(25 ) $(92 ) Increased franchise fees 21 13 34 Decreased G&A 5 13 18 Decreased equity income (5 ) (5 ) Decrease in ongoing operating profit $(41 ) $(4 ) $(45 ) Franchisee Financial Condition Like others in the QSR industry, from time to time, some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation, and in the absence of an improvement in the franchisees business trends, there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues. These include a sale of some or all of the operators restaurants to us or a third party, a restructuring of the operators business and or finances, or, in the more unusual cases, bankruptcy of the operator. It is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues. Since 2000, certain of our franchise operators, principally in the Taco Bell system, have experienced varying degrees of financial problems. Through December 28, 2002, restructurings have been completed for approximately 1,778 Taco Bell franchise restaurants. In connection with these restructurings, Taco Bell has acquired 147 restaurants for approximately $76 million. In addition to these acquisitions, Taco Bell has purchased land, buildings and or equipment related to 52 22 restaurants from franchisees for approximately $28 million and simultaneously leased it back to these franchisees under long term leases. As part of the restructurings, Taco Bell committed to fund approximately $45 million of future franchise capital expenditures, principally through leasing arrangements, approximately $26 million of which has been funded through December 28, 2002. We substantially completed the Taco Bell franchisee restructurings in 2002 and expect to finalize any remaining restructurings in the first quarter of 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2000, Taco Bell also established a $15 million loan program to assist certain franchisees. All fundings had been advanced by the end of the first quarter of 2001. A remaining net balance of $7 million at December 28, 2002 for these notes receivable is included primarily in other assets. We believe that the general improvement in business trends at Taco Bell has helped alleviate financial problems in the Taco Bell franchise system which were due to past downturns in sales. As described in the U.S. revenues section, Company same store sales growth at Taco Bell increased 7% in 2002. This follows an 8% increase in Company same store sales growth at Taco Bell in the fourth quarter of 2001. Generally, franchisees have experienced similar or better growth over these time frames. Accordingly, the cost of restructurings of Taco Bell franchise restaurants was less in 2002 than in 2001 and, though we continue to monitor this situation, we expect these costs to be less again in 2003. In 2002 and 2001, the Company charged expenses of $8 million and $18 million, respectively, to ongoing operating profit related to allowances for doubtful Taco Bell franchise and license fee receivables. These costs are reported as part of franchise and license expenses. On an ongoing basis, we assess our exposure from franchise related risks, which include estimated uncollectibility of franchise and license receivables, contingent lease liabilities, guarantees to support third party financial arrangements of franchisees and potential claims by franchisees. The contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the Lease Guarantees section of Note 24. Although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time, we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure as of December 28, 2002. It is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs; however, these costs are not expected to be material to quarterly or annual results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Impact of AmeriServe Bankruptcy Reorganization Process See Note 25 for a discussion of the impact of the AmeriServe Food Distribution, Inc. (AmeriServe) bankruptcy reorganization process on the Company. Impact of the Consolidation of an Unconsolidated Affiliate At the beginning of 2001, we consolidated a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate. As a result of this change, Company sales, restaurant margin and G&A increased approximately $100 million, $6 million and $9 million, respectively, in 2001. Also as a result of the change, franchise fees and equity income decreased approximately $4 million and $2 million, respectively, in 2001. At the date of consolidation, this previously unconsolidated affiliate operated over 100 stores. 23 Fifty third Week in 2000 Our fiscal calendar results in a fifty third week every 5 or 6 years. Fiscal year 2000 included a fifty third week in the fourth quarter. The estimated favorable impact in net income was $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in 2000. The following table summarizes the estimated favorable/(unfavorable) impact of the fifty third week on system sales, revenues and ongoing operating profit in 2000: U.S. International Unallocated Total System sales $ 230 $ 65 $ $ 295 Revenues Company sales $ 58 $ 18 $ $ 76 Franchise fees 9 2 11 Total revenues $ 67 $ 20 $ $ 87 Ongoing operating profit Franchise fees $ 9 $ 2 $ $ 11 Restaurant margin 11 4 15 General and administrative expenses (3 ) (2 ) (2) (7 ) Ongoing operating profit $ 17 $ 4 $ (2) $ 19 The Companys next fiscal year with fifty three weeks will be 2005.

(b) Includes units that existed at the date of the acquisition of YGR on May 7, 2002. Worldwide System Sales System sales represents the combined sales of Company, unconsolidated affiliates, franchise and license restaurants. Sales of unconsolidated affiliates and franchise and license restaurants result in franchise and license fees for us but are not included in the Company sales figure we present on the Consolidated Statements of Income. However, we believe that system sales is useful to investors as a significant indicator of our Concepts market share and the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. 2002 % B/(W) vs. 2001 2001 % B/(W)vs. 2000 System sales $ 24,219 8 $ 22,328 1 System sales increased approximately $1,891 million or 8% in 2002. The impact from foreign currency translation was not significant. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 5%. The increase resulted from new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. System sales increased $169 million or 1% in 2001, after a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, system sales increased 5%. This increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. 25 Worldwide Revenues Company sales increased $753 million or 12% in 2002. The impact from foreign currency translation was not significant. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, Company sales increased 6%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth. The increase was partially offset by refranchising and store closures. Company sales decreased $167 million or 3% in 2001, after a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, Company sales were flat. An increase due to new unit development was offset by refranchising. Franchise and license fees increased $51 million or 6% in 2002. The impact from foreign currency translation was not significant. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees increased 4%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Franchise and license fees increased $27 million or 3% in 2001, after a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, franchise and license fees increased 7%. The increase was driven by new unit development, units acquired from us and same store sales growth. This increase was partially offset by store closures. Worldwide Company Restaurant Margin 2002 2001 2000 Company sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Food and paper 30.6 31.1 30.8 Payroll and employee benefits 27.2 27.1 27.7 Occupancy and other operating expenses 26.2 27.0 26.4 Company restaurant margin 16.0 % 14.8 % 15.1 % Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 120 basis points in 2002. The increase included the favorable impact of approximately 50 basis points from the adoption of SFAS 142, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 15 basis points from the YGR acquisition. U.S. restaurant margin increased approximately 80 basis points and International restaurant margin increased approximately 210 basis points. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 30 basis points in 2001. U.S. restaurant margin was flat and International restaurant margin declined approximately 120 basis points. Worldwide General And Administrative Expenses G&A expenses increased $117 million or 15% in 2002. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the YGR acquisition, G&A expenses increased 10%. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation related costs and higher corporate and project spending. G&A expenses decreased $34 million or 4% in 2001. Excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, G&A expenses decreased 3%. The decrease was driven by lower corporate and project spending, the formation of unconsolidated affiliates and refranchising. The decrease was partially offset by higher compensation related costs. 26 Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses decreased $10 million or 18% in 2002. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables and the favorable impact of lapping support costs related to the financial restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees in 2001. The decrease was partially offset by higher marketing support costs in certain international markets. Franchise and license expenses increased $10 million or 20% in 2001. The increase was primarily due to support costs related to the financial restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees. The increase was partially offset by lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables. Worldwide Other (Income) Expense Other (income) expense is comprised of equity (income) loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates and foreign exchange net (gain) loss. Other (income) expense increased $7 million or 28% in 2002. Equity income increased $3 million or 12%. The impact from foreign currency translation was not significant on equity income. The increase included a $4 million favorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 142. Other (income) expense decreased $2 million or 8% in 2001. Equity income increased $1 million or 3%, after a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Worldwide Facility Actions Net Loss (Gain) We recorded facility actions net loss of $32 million in 2002 and $1 million in 2001 and facility actions net gain of $176 million in 2000. See the Store Portfolio Strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and Note 7 for a summary of the components of facility actions net loss (gain) by reportable operating segment. Worldwide Ongoing Operating Profit 2002 % B(W)vs. 2001 2001 % B(W) vs. 2000 United States $ 825 14 $ 722 (3 ) International 389 22 318 3 Unallocated and corporate expenses (178 ) (20 ) (148 ) 9 Unallocated other income (expense) (1 ) 59 (3 ) NM Ongoing operating profit $ 1,035 16 $ 889 The changes in U.S. and International ongoing operating profit for 2002 and 2001 are discussed in the respective sections. Unallocated and corporate expenses increased $30 million or 20% in 2002. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation related costs and higher corporate and project spending. Unallocated and corporate expenses decreased $15 million or 9% in 2001. Excluding the favorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, G&A decreased 8%. The decline was primarily due to lower corporate and project spending partially offset by higher compensation related costs. 27 Worldwide Interest Expense, Net 2002 2001 2000 Interest expense $ 180 $ 172 $ 190 Interest income (8 ) (14 ) (14 ) Interest expense, net $ 172 $ 158 $ 176 Net interest expense increased $14 million or 8% in 2002. Interest expense increased $8 million or 5% in 2002. Excluding the impact of the YGR acquisition, interest expense decreased 12%. The decrease was driven by a reduction in our average debt balance partially offset by an increase in our average interest rate. Our average interest rate increased due to a reduction in our variable rate borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of longer term, fixed rate notes. Net interest expense decreased $18 million or 10% in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average interest rate.

The following table reconciles the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to our ongoing effective tax rate: 2002 2001 2000 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 2.0 1.9 1.8 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (1.9 ) 0.2 (0.4 ) Adjustments relating to prior years (3.5 ) (2.2 ) 5.3 Valuation allowance reversals (1.7 ) (4.0 ) Other, net (0.3 ) (0.1 ) Ongoing effective tax rate 31.3 % 33.1 % 37.7 % The 2002 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 1.8 percentage points to 31.3%. The decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to prior years and an increase in the benefit from claiming credit against our current and future U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid, partially offset by reduced valuation allowance reversals. See Note 22 for a discussion of valuation allowances. In 2002, the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of claiming credit against our current and future U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid. The 2001 ongoing effective tax rate decreased 4.6 percentage points to 33.1%. The decrease in the ongoing effective tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to prior years, partially offset by reduced valuation allowance reversals. 28 In 2001, the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was slightly higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate because losses of foreign operations for which no benefit could be currently recognized and other adjustments more than offset the effect of claiming credit against our U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid.

Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 4%. The increase resulted from same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. 29 System sales increased $82 million or 1% in 2001. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, system sales increased 2%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth at KFC and Pizza Hut, partially offset by store closures. U.S. Revenues Company sales increased $491 million or 11% in 2002. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, company sales increased 3%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth. The increase was partially offset by store closures and refranchising. For 2002, blended Company same store sales for KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell were up 2% due to increases in both transactions and average guest check. Same store sales at Taco Bell increased 7%, primarily driven by a 4% increase in transactions. Same store sales at both Pizza Hut and KFC were flat due to a 2% increase in average guest check offset by transaction declines. Company sales decreased $246 million or 5% in 2001. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, Company sales decreased 4%. The decrease was driven by refranchising, partially offset by new unit development. For 2001, blended Company same store sales for KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell were up 1% on a comparable fifty two week basis. An increase in the average guest check was partially offset by transaction declines. Same store sales at KFC were up 3%, primarily due to an increase in transactions. Same store sales at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell were flat. A 2% increase in the average guest check at Pizza Hut and a 3% increase in the average guest check at Taco Bell were both offset by transaction declines. Franchise and license fees increased $29 million or 5% in 2002. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees increased 3%. The increase was driven by same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. Franchise and license fees grew $11 million or 2% in 2001. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, franchise and license fees increased 4%. The increase was driven by units acquired from us and new unit development, partially offset by store closures.

The increase includes the favorable impact of approximately 50 basis points from the adoption of SFAS 142, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 20 basis points from the YGR acquisition. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of same store sales growth on margin and lower food and paper costs, partially offset by an increase in labor costs. The decrease in food and paper costs was primarily driven by cheese costs. The increase in labor costs was primarily driven by wage rates. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was flat in 2001. The favorable impact of same store sales growth on margin was offset by increases in occupancy and other costs, food and paper costs and labor costs. The increase in food and paper costs was primarily driven by cheese costs. The increase in labor costs was primarily driven by wage rates. U.S. Ongoing Operating Profit Ongoing operating profit increased $103 million or 14% in 2002, including a 3% favorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 142. Excluding the favorable impact of both SFAS 142 and the YGR acquisition, ongoing operating profit increased 8%. The increase was driven by same store sales growth and the favorable impact of lapping franchise support costs related to the restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees in 2001. The increase was partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs, primarily due to higher labor costs, and the unfavorable impact of refranchising and store closures. The higher labor costs were driven by wage rates. Ongoing operating profit decreased $20 million or 3% in 2001. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the fifty third week in 2000, ongoing operating profit decreased 1%. The decrease was driven by the unfavorable impact of refranchising and store closures, higher restaurant operating costs and higher franchise support costs related to the restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees. The decrease was partially offset by same store sales growth and new unit development.

International System Sales 2002 % B(W)vs. 2001 2001 % B(W)vs. 2000 System sales $8,380 8 $7,732 1 System sales increased approximately $648 million or 8% in 2002, after a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 8%. The increase resulted from new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. System sales increased approximately $87 million or 1% in 2001, after a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, system sales increased 9%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. 32 International Revenues Company sales increased $262 million or 14% in 2002, after a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. The unfavorable impact of refranchising primarily resulted from the sale of the Singapore business in the third quarter of 2002. Company sales increased $79 million or 5% in 2001, after a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, Company sales increased 11%. The increase was driven by new unit development and acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees. The increase was partially offset by the contribution of Company stores to new unconsolidated affiliates. Franchise and license fees increased $22 million or 8% in 2002, after a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees increased 8%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Franchise and license fees increased $16 million or 6% in 2001, after a 6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, franchise and license fees increased 13%. The increase was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and the contribution of Company stores to new unconsolidated affiliates. The increase was partially offset by store closures.

The increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lower restaurant operating costs and the elimination of lower average margin units through store closures. Lower restaurant operating costs primarily resulted from lower food and paper costs, partially offset by higher labor costs. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 120 basis points in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher restaurant operating costs and the acquisition of below average margin stores from franchisees. The decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of same store sales growth. 33 International Ongoing Operating Profit Ongoing operating profit increased $71 million or 22% in 2002, after a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 142, ongoing operating profit increased 17%. The increase was driven by new unit development and the favorable impact of lower restaurant operating costs, primarily lower cost of food and paper. The increase was partially offset by higher G&A expenses, primarily compensation related costs. Ongoing operating profit increased $9 million or 3% in 2001, after a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lapping the fifty third week in 2000, ongoing operating profit increased 12%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,088 million compared to $832 million in 2001. Excluding the impact of the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, cash provided by operating activities was $1,043 million versus $704 million in 2001. This increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit and timing of tax receipts and payments. In 2001, net cash provided by operating activities was $832 million compared to $491 million in 2000. Excluding the impact of the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, cash provided by operating activities was $704 million versus $734 million in 2000. Net cash used in investing activities was $885 million versus $503 million in 2001. The increase in cash used was primarily due to the acquisition of YGR and higher capital spending in 2002, partially offset by the acquisition of fewer restaurants from franchisees in 2002. In 2001, net cash used in investing activities was $503 million versus $237 million in 2000. The increase in cash used was primarily due to lower gross refranchising proceeds as a result of selling fewer restaurants in 2001 and increased acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and capital spending. The increase was partially offset by lapping the funding of a debtor in possession revolving credit facility to AmeriServe in 2000. Although we report gross proceeds in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also consider refranchising proceeds on an after tax basis. We define after tax proceeds as gross refranchising proceeds less the settlement of working capital liabilities (primarily accounts payable and property taxes) related to the units refranchised and payment of taxes on the gains. The after tax proceeds can be used to pay down debt or repurchase shares. After tax proceeds were approximately $71 million in 2002 which reflects a 21% decrease from 2001. This decrease was due to the refranchising of fewer restaurants in 2002 versus 2001. Net cash used in financing activities was $187 million versus $352 million in 2001. The decrease is primarily due to lower debt repayments and higher proceeds from stock option exercises versus 2001, partially offset by higher shares repurchased in 2002. In 2001, net cash used in financing activities was $352 million compared to $207 million in 2000. The increase in cash used is primarily due to higher repayment of debt, partially offset by fewer shares repurchased in 2001 compared to 2000. In November 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program. This program authorizes us to repurchase, through November 20, 2004, up to $300 million of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees). During 2002, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares for approximately $28 million under this program. 34 In February 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program. This program authorized us to repurchase up to $300 million of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees). This share repurchase program was completed in 2002. During 2002, we repurchased approximately 7.0 million shares for approximately $200 million under this program. During 2001, we repurchased approximately 4.8 million shares for approximately $100 million. In September 1999, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program. This program authorized us to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees). This share repurchase program was completed in 2000. During 2000, we repurchased approximately 12.8 million shares for approximately $216 million. See Note 21 for a discussion of the share repurchase programs. Financing Activities On June 25, 2002, we closed on a new $1.4 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the New Credit Facility). The New Credit Facility replaced the existing bank credit agreement which was comprised of a senior unsecured Term Loan Facility and a $1.75 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (collectively referred to as the Old Credit Facilities) that were scheduled to mature on October 2, 2002. On December 27, 2002, we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the New Credit Facility from $1.4 billion to $1.2 billion. The New Credit Facility matures on June 25, 2005. We used the initial borrowings under the New Credit Facility to repay the indebtedness under the Old Credit Facilities. The New Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains other terms and provisions (including representations, warranties, covenants, conditions and events of default) similar to those set forth in the Old Credit Facilities. Specifically, the New Credit Facility contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The New Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, cash dividends, aggregate non U.S. investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement. Under the terms of the New Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit. At December 28, 2002, our unused New Credit Facility totaled $0.9 billion, net of outstanding letters of credit of $0.2 billion. The interest rate for borrowings under the New Credit Facility ranges from 1.00% to 2.00% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or 0.00% to 0.65% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, will depend upon our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest is payable at least quarterly. In the third quarter of 2002, we capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately $9 million related to the New Credit Facility. These debt issuance costs will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the New Credit Facility. In June 2002, we issued $400 million of 7.70% Senior Unsecured Notes due July 1, 2012 (the 2012 Notes). The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2012 Notes were used to repay indebtedness under the New Credit Facility. Interest on the 2012 Notes is payable January 1 and July 1 of each year and commenced on January 1, 2003. We capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately $5 million related to the 2012 Notes in third quarter of 2002. Subsequent to this issuance, we have $150 million available for issuance under a $2 billion shelf registration filed in 1997. As discussed in Note 4, upon the acquisition of YGR, we assumed approximately $168 million in present value of future rent obligations related to certain sale leaseback agreements entered into by YGR involving approximately 350 LJS units. As a result of liens held by the buyer/lessor on certain personal property within the units, the sale leaseback agreements have been accounted for as financings and are reflected as debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 28, 2002. Rental payments made under these agreements will be made on a monthly basis through 2019 with an effective interest rate of approximately 11%. 35 Consolidated Financial Condition Assets increased $975 million or 22% to $5.4 billion. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of YGR and the impact of capital spending. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from $77 million to $42 million was primarily the result of recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process (see Note 25) and the write off of receivables previously fully reserved. The increase in assets classified as held for sale is due primarily to classification of our Puerto Rico market as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2002. Liabilities increased $485 million or 11% to $4.8 billion. The increase was primarily due to additional financing associated with the acquisition of YGR. As discussed in Note 14, the decrease in short term borrowings of $550 million and the increase in long term debt of $747 million are primarily the result of the replacement of our Old Credit Facilities that were to expire in October 2002 with the New Credit Facility that will expire in 2005. The increase in current income taxes payable was primarily the result of a reclassification from other liabilities and deferred credits for taxes that are now expected to be paid within the next twelve months. Liquidity Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment in operating assets. Typically, our cash flows include a significant amount of discretionary capital spending. Though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations, we believe our operating cash flows and ability to adjust discretionary capital spending and borrow funds will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2003 and beyond. Significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 28, 2002 due by period included: Total Less than 1Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5years Long term debt(a) $ 2,173 $ 2 $ 508 $ 207 $ 1,456 Short term borrowings 134 134 Debt excluding capital leases 2,307 136 508 207 1,456 Capital leases(b) 181 14 27 23 117 Operating leases(b) 1,974 276 456 337 905 Franchisee financing commitments 19 9 10 Total contractual obligations $ 4,481 $ 435 $ 1,001 $ 567 $ 2,478 (a) Excludes a fair value adjustment of $44 million included in debt related to interest swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to approximately 5,600 restaurants. See Note 14 for a discussion of short term borrowings and long term debt and Note 15 for a discussion of leases. 36 In addition, we have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events. As of December 28, 2002, the maximum exposure under these commercial commitments, which are shown on a nominal basis, included: Contingent liabilities associated with lease assignments or guarantees $388 Standby letters of credit(a) 193 Guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates debt(b) 26 Other commercial commitments 27 (a) Includes $32 million related to guarantees of financial arrangements of franchisees, which are supported by stand by letters of credit. (b) As of December 28, 2002, this debt totaled approximately $152 million, our share of which was approximately $77 million. As noted above, we have guaranteed $26 million of this total debt obligation. Our unconsolidated affiliates had total assets of over $1 billion as of year end 2002 and total revenues of approximately $1.8 billion in 2002. See Notes 14 and 24 for a further discussion of these commitments. Other Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Expected to Impact 2003 Operating Profit Comparisons with 2002 New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2. Pension Plan Funded Status Certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after September 30, 2001 are no longer eligible to participate. As of our September 30, 2002 measurement date, these plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $501 million, an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) of $448 million and a fair value of plan assets of $251 million. Subsequent to the measurement date but prior to December 28, 2002, we made an additional $25 million contribution to the plans which is not included in this fair value of plan assets. As a result of the $250 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the PBO at September 30, 2002, we have recorded a $71 million charge to shareholders equity (net of tax of $43 million) as of December 28, 2002. The PBO and ABO reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees. The PBO incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the ABO reflects only current compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBO and ABO are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. We measured our PBO and ABO using a discount rate of 6.85% at September 30, 2002. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our PBO by approximately $49 million at September 30, 2002. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our PBO by approximately $56 million at September 30, 2002. 37 Due to recent stock market declines, our pension plan assets have experienced losses in value in 2002 and 2001 totaling approximately $75 million. We changed our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from 10% to 8.5% for the determination of our 2002 expense. We believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. This change resulted in the recognition of approximately $5 million in incremental expense in comparison to 2001. We will continue to use the 8.5% expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in 2003. Given no change to the market related value of our plan assets as of September 30, 2002, a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our pension plan expense by approximately $3 million. The losses our plan assets have experienced, along with the decrease in discount rates, have largely contributed to the unrecognized actuarial loss of $169 million in our plans as of September 30, 2002. For purposes of determining 2002 expense our funded status was such that we recognized $1 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2002. We will recognize approximately $7 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2003. Given no change to the assumptions at our September 30, 2002 measurement date, actuarial loss recognition will increase gradually over the next few years, however, we do not believe the increase will materially impact our results of operations. In total, we expect pension expense to increase approximately $14 million to $41 million in 2003. We have incorporated this incremental expense into our operating plans and outlook. The increase is driven by an increase in interest cost because of the higher PBO and the recognition of actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate, though as previously mentioned the plans are closed to new participants. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 6.85% at September 30, 2002 would impact our pension expense by approximately $11 million. We do not believe that the underfunded status of the pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in 2003 or future years. Given current funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate making contributions to fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five years. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities of approximately $1 billion per year are sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the plans, and anticipated fundings have been incorporated into our cash flow projections. We have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our operating plans and outlook. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a significant market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. 38 At December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of $6 million and $4 million, respectively, in annual income before taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 would decrease approximately $8 million and $5 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 would decrease approximately $93 million and $72 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk International ongoing operating profit constitutes approximately 32% of our ongoing operating profit in 2002, excluding unallocated and corporate expenses. In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1 billion as of December 28, 2002. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002, operating profit would have decreased $43 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a limited basis, commodity future and option contracts. Commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2002, and December 29, 2001, did not significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
