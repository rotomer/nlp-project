Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as YUM or the Company) comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers (LJS) and A&W All American Food Restaurants (A&W)(collectively the Concepts) and is the worlds largest quick service restaurant (QSR) company based on the number of system units. LJS and A&W were added when YUM acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. (YGR) on May 7, 2002. With 12,377 international units, YUM is the second largest QSR company outside the U.S. YUM became an independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the Spin off Date) via a tax free distribution of our Common Stock (the Distribution or Spin off) to the shareholders of our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo). Through its Concepts, YUM develops, operates, franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and non traditional QSR restaurants. Traditional units feature dine in, carryout and, in some instances, drive thru or delivery services. Non traditional units, which are typically licensed outlets, include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. The retail food industry, in which the Company competes, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, convenience, location and concept. The industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Each of the Concepts compete with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally owned restaurants, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees. The Company is focused on five long term measures identified as essential to our growth and progress. These five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows: International expansion International system sales growth (local currency) Number of new international restaurant openings Net international unit growth Multibrand innovation and expansion Number of multibrand restaurant locations Number of multibrand units added Number of franchise multibrand units added Portfolio of category leading U.S. brands U.S. blended same store sales growth U.S. system sales growth Global franchise fees New restaurant openings by franchisees Franchise fee growth 17 Strong cash generation and returns Cash generated from all sources Cash generated from all sources after capital spending Restaurant margins Our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). All references to per share and share amounts in the following MD&A have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split distributed on June 17, 2002. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 42 through 45 and the Cautionary Statements on page 40. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 46 through 81. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Factors Affecting Comparability of 2003 Results to 2002 Results and 2002 Results to 2001 Results YGR Acquisition On May 7, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of YGR, the parent company of LJS and A&W. See Note 4 for a discussion of the acquisition. As of the date of the acquisition, YGR consisted of 742 and 496 company and franchise LJS units, respectively, and 127 and 742 company and franchise A&W units, respectively. In addition, 133 multibranded LJS/A&W restaurants were included in the LJS unit totals. Except as discussed in certain sections of the MD&A, the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in 2003 and 2002 was not significant relative to the comparable prior year period. Amendment of Sale Leaseback Agreements As discussed in Note 14, on August 15, 2003 we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of YGR such that the agreements now qualify for sale leaseback accounting. There was no gain or loss recorded as a result of this transaction; however, restaurant margins decreased by approximately $3 million for the year ended December 27, 2003 as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment. The decrease in restaurant margin was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense. Wrench Litigation We recorded expense of $42 million in 2003. See Note 24 for a discussion of the Wrench litigation. AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits) We recorded income of $26 million in 2003, $27 million in 2002 and $3 million in 2001. See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other charges (credits). Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of key U.S. and International markets. Such refranchisings reduce our reported Company sales and restaurant profits while increasing our franchise fees. Proceeds from refranchising increase the level of cash available to fund discretionary spending. 18 The following table summarizes our refranchising activities: 2003 2002 2001 Number of units refranchised 228 174 233 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 92 $ 81 $111 Refranchising net gains, pre tax(a) $ 4 $ 19 $ 39 (a) 2003 includes charges of approximately $16 million to write down the carrying value of our Puerto Rican business to reflect the then current estimates of its fair value. The charges were recorded as a refranchising loss. 2001 includes $12 million of previously deferred refranchising gains and a charge of $11 million to mark to market the net assets of our Singapore business, which was sold during 2002 at a price approximately equal to its carrying value. In addition to our refranchising program, from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing, we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit (collectively store closures). The following table summarizes Company store closure activities: 2003 2002 2001 Number of units closed 287 224 270 Store closure costs $ 6 $ 15 $ 17 Impairment charges for stores to be closed $ 12 $ 9 $ 5 The impact on operating profit arising from our refranchising and Company store closures is the net of (a) the estimated reduction in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and general and administrative expenses and (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we open in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit. The following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising and Company store closures: 2003 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased sales $ (148 ) $ (120 ) $ (268 ) Increased franchise fees 1 5 6 Decrease in total revenues $ (147 ) $ (115 ) $ (262 ) 2002 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased sales $ (214 ) $ (90 ) $ (304 ) Increased franchise fees 4 4 8 Decrease in total revenues $ (210 ) $ (86 ) $ (296 ) 19 The following table summarizes the estimated impact on operating profit of refranchising and Company store closures: 2003 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (18 ) $ (15 ) $ (33 ) Increased franchise fees 1 5 6 Decreased general and administrative expenses 6 6 Decrease in operating profit $ (17 ) $ (4 ) $ (21 ) 2002 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (23 ) $ (5 ) $ (28 ) Increased franchise fees 4 4 8 Decreased general and administrative expenses 1 2 3 (Decrease) increase in operating profit $ (18 ) $ 1 $ (17 ) Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), in its entirety. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 142, we ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of December 30, 2001. The following table summarizes the favorable effect of SFAS 142 on restaurant profit, restaurant margin and operating profit had SFAS 142 been effective in 2001. Year Ended December 29, 2001 U.S. International Worldwide Restaurant profit $ 21 $ 11 $ 32 Restaurant margin (%) 0.5 0.6 0.5 Operating profit $ 22 $ 16 $ 38 Additionally, if SFAS 142 had been effective in 2001, reported net income would have increased approximately $26 million and diluted earnings per common share (EPS) would have increased $0.09. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or as impairment indicators exist. In accordance with this requirement, we recognized impairment of approximately $5 million in both 2003 and 2002. 20 Worldwide Results of Operations 2003 % B(W) vs. 2002 2002 % B(W)vs. 2001 Revenues Company sales $ 7,441 8 $ 6,891 12 Franchise and license fees 939 9 866 6 Total revenues $ 8,380 8 $ 7,757 12 Company restaurant margin $ 1,104 $ 1,101 22 % of Company sales 14.8 % (1.2) ppts. 16.0 % 1.2 ppts.

Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. For 2003 and 2002, Company multibrand unit gross additions were 235 and 216, respectively. For 2003 and 2002, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 194 and 166, respectively. Worldwide System Sales Growth System Sales Growth 2003 2002 Worldwide 7 % 8 % System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. System sales increased 7% for 2003, after a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact of both foreign currency translation and the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 3%. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures. System sales increased 8% in 2002. The impact from foreign currency translation was not significant. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 5%. The increase resulted from new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. 22 Worldwide Revenues Company sales increased $550 million or 8% in 2003, after a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact of both foreign currency translation and the YGR acquisition, Company sales increased 4%. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures and refranchising. Franchise and license fees increased $73 million or 9% in 2003, after a 3% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees increased 5%. The increase was driven by new unit development, royalty rate increases and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Company sales increased $753 million or 12% in 2002. The impact from foreign currency translation was not significant. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, Company sales increased 6%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth. The increase was partially offset by refranchising and store closures. Franchise and license fees increased $51 million or 6% in 2002. The impact from foreign currency translation was not significant. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees increased 4%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Worldwide Company Restaurant Margin 2003 2002 2001 Company sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Food and paper 30.9 30.6 31.1 Payroll and employee benefits 27.2 27.2 27.1 Occupancy and other operating expenses 27.1 26.2 27.0 Company restaurant margin 14.8 % 16.0 % 14.8 % Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 120 basis points in 2003. U.S. restaurant margin decreased approximately 140 basis points and International restaurant margin decreased approximately 50 basis points. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 120 basis points in 2002. The increase included the favorable impact of approximately 50 basis points from the adoption of SFAS 142, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 15 basis points from the YGR acquisition. U.S. restaurant margin increased approximately 80 basis points and International restaurant margin increased approximately 210 basis points. The changes in U.S. and International restaurant margin for 2003 and 2002 are discussed in the respective sections. Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $32 million or 3% in 2003, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact from both foreign currency translation and the YGR acquisition, general and administrative expenses were flat year to date. Lower management incentive compensation costs were offset by increases in expenses associated with international restaurant expansion and pension expense. General and administrative expenses increased $117 million or 15% in 2002. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the YGR acquisition, general and administrative expenses increased 10%. The increase was driven by higher compensation related costs and higher corporate and project spending. 23 Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses decreased $21 million or 42% in 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables, primarily at Taco Bell. Franchise and license expenses decreased $10 million or 18% in 2002. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables and the favorable impact of lapping support costs related to the financial restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees in 2001. The decrease was partially offset by higher marketing support costs in certain international markets. Worldwide Other (Income) Expense 2003 2002 2001 Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ (39 ) $ (29 ) $ (26 ) Foreign exchange net (gain) loss (2 ) (1 ) 3 Other (income) expense $ (41 ) $ (30 ) $ (23 ) The increase in other (income) expense in 2003 was primarily driven by the improved operating performance of our unconsolidated affiliates, particularly in China. Worldwide Facility Actions We recorded a net loss from facility actions of $36 million, $32 million and $1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See the Store Portfolio Strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and Note 7 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment. Worldwide Operating Profit 2003 % B(W) vs. 2002 2002 % B(W) vs. 2001 United States $ 812 1 $ 802 15 International 441 22 361 19 Unallocated and corporate expenses (179 ) (178 ) (20 ) Unallocated other income (expense) (3 ) NM (1 ) NM Unallocated facility actions gain 4 NM 19 NM Wrench litigation (42 ) NM AmeriServe and other (charges) credits 26 NM 27 NM Operating profit $ 1,059 3 $ 1,030 16 The changes in U.S. and International operating profit for 2003 and 2002 are discussed in the respective sections. Unallocated and corporate expenses increased $1 million in 2003 and $30 million or 20% in 2002. The 2002 increase was primarily driven by higher compensation related costs and higher corporate and project spending. Unallocated facility actions comprises refranchising gains (losses) which are not allocated to the U.S. or International segments for performance reporting purposes. See Note 7 for further discussion. 24 Worldwide Interest Expense, Net 2003 2002 2001 Interest expense $ 185 $ 180 $ 172 Interest income (12 ) (8 ) (14 ) Interest expense, net $ 173 $ 172 $ 158 Interest expense increased $5 million or 3% in 2003. Excluding the impact of the YGR acquisition, interest expense decreased 6%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average debt outstanding. Interest expense increased $8 million or 5% in 2002. Excluding the impact of the YGR acquisition, interest expense decreased 12%. The decrease was driven by a reduction in our average debt balance partially offset by an increase in our average interest rate. Our average interest rate increased due to a reduction in our variable rate borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of longer term, fixed rate notes. Worldwide Income Taxes 2003 2002 2001 Reported Income taxes $ 268 $ 275 $ 241 Effective tax rate 30.2 % 32.1 % 32.8 % The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2003 2002 2001 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 1.8 2.0 2.1 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (3.6 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 ) Adjustments to reserves and prior years (1.7 ) (1.8 ) (1.8 ) Foreign tax credit amended return benefit (4.1 ) Valuation allowance additions (reversals) 2.8 (1.7 ) Other, net (0.3 ) (0.1 ) Effective tax rate 30.2 % 32.1 % 32.8 % Income taxes and the effective tax rate as shown above reflect tax on all amounts included in our results of operations except for the income tax benefit of approximately $1 million on the $2 million cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the year ended December 27, 2003 due to the adoption of SFAS 143. The 2003 effective tax rate decreased 1.9 percentage points to 30.2%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a 4.1 percentage point benefit of amending certain prior U.S. income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years. The returns were amended upon our determination that it was more beneficial to claim credit for such taxes than to deduct such taxes, as had been done when the returns were originally filed. In future years, we anticipate continuing to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in the then current year, as we have done in 2003 and 2002. However, the amended return benefit recognized in 2003 is non recurring. The decrease in the 2003 effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not. The valuation allowances recognized primarily related to deferred tax assets in Mexico and Thailand. See Note 22 for a discussion of valuation allowances. 25 The 2002 effective tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points to 32.1%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to our claiming credit against our current and future U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid in 2002, as opposed to deducting such taxes on our U.S. income tax returns as was done in 2001. This decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping valuation allowance reversals recorded in 2001. In 2003 and 2002, the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of claiming credit against our current and future U.S. income tax liability for foreign taxes paid. Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that we believe may impact our exposure.

Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 1%. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures. System sales increased 9% in 2002. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 4%. The increase resulted from same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. U.S. Revenues Company sales increased $303 million or 6% in 2003. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, company sales increased 2%. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures and refranchising. Franchise and license fees increased $5 million or 1% in 2003. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees remained essentially flat as a decrease primarily driven by store closures was largely offset by new unit development. Company sales increased $491 million or 11% in 2002. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, company sales increased 3%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth. The increase was partially offset by store closures and refranchising. Franchise and license fees increased $29 million or 5% in 2002. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees increased 3%. The increase was driven by same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. U.S. Same Store Sales U.S. same store sales includes only company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same store sales include KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell company owned restaurants only. U.S. same store sales for Long John Silvers and A&W restaurants are not included. Following are the same store sales growth results by brand: 2003 Same Store Sales Transactions Average Guest Check KFC (2 )% (4 )% 2 % Pizza Hut (1 )% (4 )% 3 % Taco Bell 2 % 1 % 1 % 27 2002 Same Store Sales Transactions Average Guest Check KFC (2 )% 2 % Pizza Hut (2 )% 2 % Taco Bell 7 % 4 % 3 % For 2003, blended Company same store sales were flat due to a decrease in transactions offset by an increase in average guest check. For 2002, blended Company same store sales were up 2% due to increases in both transactions and average guest check. U.S. Company Restaurant Margin 2003 2002 2001 Company sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Food and paper 28.8 28.2 28.6 Payroll and employee benefits 31.0 30.9 30.6 Occupancy and other operating expenses 25.6 24.9 25.6 Company restaurant margin 14.6 % 16.0 % 15.2 % Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 140 basis points in 2003. The decrease was primarily driven by increased occupancy expenses due to higher rent, primarily due to additional rent expense associated with the amended YGR sale leaseback agreements, and utilities. The higher food and paper costs were primarily due to the impact of unfavorable discounting and product mix. Also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs, primarily driven by low single digit increases in wage rates. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 80 basis points in 2002. The increase includes the favorable impact of approximately 50 basis points from the adoption of SFAS 142, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 20 basis points from the YGR acquisition. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of same store sales growth on margin and lower food and paper costs, partially offset by an increase in labor costs. The decrease in food and paper costs was primarily driven by cheese costs. The increase in labor costs was primarily driven by wage rates. U.S. Operating Profit Operating profit increased $10 million or 1% in 2003. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, operating profit was flat compared to 2002. Decreases driven by lower margins as a result of increased occupancy expenses and the impact of unfavorable discounting and product mix shift on food and paper costs were offset by lower franchise and license and general and administrative expenses. Operating profit increased $107 million or 15% in 2002, including a 3% favorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 142. Excluding the favorable impact of both SFAS 142 and the YGR acquisition, operating profit increased 9%. The increase was driven by same store sales growth and the favorable impact of lapping franchise support costs related to the restructuring of certain Taco Bell franchisees in 2001. The increase was partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs, primarily due to higher labor costs, and the unfavorable impact of refranchising and store closures. The higher labor costs were driven by wage rates. 28 International Results of Operations 2003 % B(W) vs. 2002 2002 % B(W) vs. 2001 Revenues Company sales $ 2,360 12 $ 2,113 14 Franchise and license fees 365 23 297 8 Total revenues $ 2,725 13 $ 2,410 13 Company restaurant margin $ 365 8 $ 337 31 % of Company sales 15.5 % (0.5 ) ppts. 16.0 % 2.1 ppts.

Company multibrand restaurants at December 27, 2003 also include 9 units acquired during the year from an unconsolidated affiliate. For 2003 and 2002, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 34 and 13, respectively. 29 International System Sales Growth System Sales Growth 2003 2002 International 14 % 8 % System sales increased 14% in 2003, after a 7% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures. System sales increased 8% in 2002, after a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, system sales increased 8%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. International Revenues Company sales increased $247 million or 12% in 2003, after a 4% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by refranchising, same store sales declines and store closures. Franchise and license fees increased $68 million or 23% in 2003, after a 9% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by new unit development, royalty rate increases and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Company sales increased $262 million or 14% in 2002, after a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. The unfavorable impact of refranchising primarily resulted from the sale of the Singapore business in the third quarter of 2002. Franchise and license fees increased $22 million or 8% in 2002, after a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, franchise and license fees increased 8%. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. International Company Restaurant Margin 2003 2002 2001 Company sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Food and paper 35.5 36.1 36.9 Payroll and employee benefits 19.0 18.7 19.1 Occupancy and other operating expenses 30.0 29.2 30.1 Company restaurant margin 15.5 % 16.0 % 13.9 % 30 Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 50 basis points in 2003, including a 20 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The remaining decrease was driven by the impact on margin of same store sales declines. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of supply chain savings initiatives on the cost of food and paper (principally in China), and the cessation of depreciation expense of approximately $9 million for the Puerto Rico business which is held for sale. Restaurant margin as a percentage of sales increased approximately 210 basis points in 2002, including the favorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from the adoption of SFAS 142. The increase was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lower restaurant operating costs and the elimination of lower average margin units through store closures. Lower restaurant operating costs primarily resulted from lower food and paper costs, partially offset by higher labor costs. International Operating Profit Operating profit increased $80 million or 22% in 2003, including a 7% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The remaining increase was driven by new unit development and the impact of supply chain savings initiatives on the cost of food and paper, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines on margins and higher general and administrative expenses. Operating profit increased $56 million or 19% in 2002. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the favorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 142, operating profit increased 13%. The increase was driven by new unit development and the favorable impact of lower restaurant operating costs, primarily lower cost of food and paper. The increase was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses, primarily compensation related costs. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,053 million compared to $1,088 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily driven by $130 million in voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan in 2003, partially offset by higher net income. In 2002, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,088 million compared to $832 million in 2001. Excluding the impact of the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process, cash provided by operating activities was $1,043 million versus $704 million in 2001. The increase was driven by higher net income and timing of tax receipts and payments. Net cash used in investing activities was $519 million versus $885 million in 2002. The decrease in cash used was driven by the $275 million acquisition of YGR in 2002 and lower capital spending in 2003. In 2002, net cash used in investing activities was $885 million versus $503 million in 2001. The increase in cash used was primarily due to the acquisition of YGR and higher capital spending in 2002, partially offset by the acquisition of fewer restaurants from franchisees in 2002. Net cash used in financing activities was $475 million versus $187 million in 2002. The increase was driven by higher net debt repayments and higher shares repurchased in 2003. In 2002, net cash used in financing activities was $187 million versus $352 million in 2001. The decrease is primarily due to lower debt repayments and higher proceeds from stock option exercises versus 2001, partially offset by higher shares repurchased in 2002. Consolidated Financial Condition Assets increased $220 million or 4% to $5.6 billion primarily due to a net increase in property, plant and equipment, driven by capital expenditures in excess of depreciation and asset dispositions. The decrease in the allowance for 31 doubtful accounts from $42 million to $28 million was primarily the result of the write off of receivables previously fully reserved. Liabilities decreased $306 million or 6% to $4.5 billion primarily due to the repayment of amounts under our Credit Facility, decreased short term borrowings and the reduction in long term debt as a result of the amendment of certain sale leaseback agreements (see Note 14). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily due to the accrual of $42 million related to the Wrench litigation. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last two fiscal years, net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion. These cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending, while at the same time reducing our long term debt balances. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and repurchases of shares of our common stock. Though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations, we believe our operating cash flows, our ability to reduce discretionary spending, and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2004 and beyond. Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) which matures on June 25, 2005. On December 26, 2003, we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the Credit Facility from $1.2 billion to $1.0 billion. At December 27, 2003, our unused Credit Facility totaled $737 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $263 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 27, 2003. Our Credit Facility contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, level of cash dividends, aggregate non U.S. investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 27, 2003, and do not anticipate that the covenants will impact our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility for its remaining term. The remainder of our long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes. Amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were $1.85 billion at December 27, 2003. The first of these notes, in the amount of $350 million, matures in 2005. We currently anticipate that our net cash provided by operating activities will permit us to make a significant portion of this $350 million payment without borrowing additional amounts. We estimate that capital spending will be approximately $770 million and refranchising proceeds will be approximately $100 million in 2004. In November 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program. At December 27, 2003, we had remaining capacity to repurchase, through May 21, 2005, up to $294 million of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under this program. 32 In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 27, 2003 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt(a) $1,930 $ 1 $ 553 $254 $1,122 Capital leases(b) 192 15 29 26 122 Operating leases(b) 2,484 320 540 431 1,193 Purchase obligations(c) 162 124 26 7 5 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP 31 17 5 9 Total contractual obligations $4,799 $460 $1,165 $723 $2,451 (a) Excludes a fair value adjustment of $29 million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 14. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to approximately 5,900 restaurants. See Note 15. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as marketing, information technology, maintenance, consulting and other agreements. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. The pension plans funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets. We are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2004, but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plans expected September 30, 2004 funded status. During 2003, we made voluntary pension contributions of $130 million to our funded plan, none of which represented minimum funding requirements. Our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made postretirement benefit payments of $4 million in 2003. Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for employee health and property and casualty losses for which we are self insured. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 27, 2003, we had provided approximately $32 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools, both of which were implemented prior to spin off, related primarily to the Companys historical refranchising programs and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately $123 million at December 27, 2003. In support of these guarantees, we have posted $32 million of letters of credit. We also provide a standby letter of credit of $23 million under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools. Any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to facility actions. New loans are not currently being added to either loan pool. 33 We have guaranteed certain lines of credit and loans of Unconsolidated Affiliates totaling $28 million at December 27, 2003. Our Unconsolidated Affiliates had total revenues of over $1.5 billion for the year ended December 27, 2003 and assets and debt of approximately $858 million and $41 million, respectively, at December 27, 2003. Other Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Expected to Impact 2004 Operating Profit Comparisons with 2003 New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted See Note 2. Canada Unconsolidated Affiliate Dissolution On November 10, 2003 our Unconsolidated Affiliate that previously operated 479 KFC, 236 Pizza Hut and 18 Taco Bell restaurants in Canada was dissolved. We owned 50% of this Unconsolidated Affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method. Upon dissolution, the Company assumed operation and acquired all associated assets of the Pizza Huts, as well as 17 Taco Bells and 5 KFCs. The Company also acquired the real estate associated with 140 KFCs for which the Company will not be the operator. Our former partner in the Unconsolidated Affiliate acquired full ownership of all other assets, as well as the franchise rights to operate 474 KFCs and one Taco Bell. Our former partner retained 10 KFCs and sold the remainder of these assets and franchise rights acquired to a newly formed, publicly held Income Trust in Canada, of which our former partner now holds a minority interest. The Company leases land and buildings for KFCs it does not operate to the Income Trust under operating and capital lease agreements through 2018. The Company will continue to receive a franchise royalty from the KFCs operated by our former partner and the Income Trust. The Company realized an immaterial gain upon dissolution of the Unconsolidated Affiliate. This gain was realized as the fair value of our increased ownership in the assets received was greater than our carrying value in those assets, and was net of expenses associated with the dissolution of the Unconsolidated Affiliate. The impact of the restructuring on our 2003 results of operations was not significant. As a result of the restructuring, 2004 Company sales are expected to increase by approximately $165 million and franchise fees are expected to decrease by approximately $10 million. The impact on net income is not expected to be material. Amendment of Sale Leaseback Agreements As discussed in Note 14 and on page 18 of this MD&A, in 2003 we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of YGR. We estimate the impact of these amendments in 2004 to be a decrease in restaurant profit of $8 million and a decrease in interest expense of $10 million. Puerto Rico Business Held for Sale Our Puerto Rican business has been held for sale since the fourth quarter of 2002. While a sale of the Puerto Rican business has not yet occurred, we continue to believe that it is probable that a sale will occur during 2004. Sales and restaurant profits of the Puerto Rican business were $187 million and $34 million in 2003. Contingent Lease Guarantees Under terms of our separation agreements at the time of the Spin off, we indemnified PepsiCo for any losses incurred related to their guarantees of lease agreements of certain non core businesses which were sold prior to the Spin off. Two of these businesses, Chevys Mexican Restaurant (Chevys) and Hot n Now (HNN) filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2003 and January 2004, respectively. While we cannot presently determine our liability under these indemnities, 34 if any, we do not expect the amount to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Any costs incurred will be charged to AmeriServe and other charges (credits). See Note 24 for further discussion. Pension Plan Funded Status Certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after September 30, 2001 are no longer eligible to participate. As of our September 30, 2003 measurement date, these plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $629 million, an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) of $563 million and a fair value of plan assets of $438 million. As a result of the $125 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the ABO at September 30, 2003, we have recorded a $101 million charge to shareholders equity (net of tax of $61 million) as of December 27, 2003. The PBO and ABO reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees. The PBO incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the ABO reflects only current compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBO and ABO are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. We measured our PBO and ABO using a discount rate of 6.25% at September 30, 2003. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our PBO by approximately $58 million at September 30, 2003. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our PBO by approximately $60 million at September 30, 2003. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.5%. We believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. Given no change to the market related value of our plan assets as of September 30, 2003, a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our 2004 pension plan expense by approximately $4 million. The losses our plan assets have experienced, along with the decrease in discount rates, have largely contributed to the unrecognized actuarial loss of $230 million in our plans as of September 30, 2003. For purposes of determining 2003 expense our funded status was such that we recognized $6 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2003. We will recognize approximately $19 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2004. Given no change to the assumptions at our September 30, 2003 measurement date, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2004 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline. In total, we expect pension expense to increase approximately $14 million to $54 million in 2004. We have incorporated this incremental expense into our operating plans and outlook. The increase is driven by the recognition of actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph and an increase in interest cost because of the higher PBO. Service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate, though, as previously mentioned, the plans are closed to new participants. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 6.25% at September 30, 2003 would impact our 2004 pension expense by approximately $11 million. We do not believe that the underfunded status of the pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in 2004 or future years. Given current funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate making contributions to fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five years. We believe our cash flows from operating activities of approximately $1 billion per year are sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the plans, and anticipated fundings have been incorporated into our cash flow projections. We have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our operating plans and outlook. Avian Flu In several Asian markets, including Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and certain sections of China, avian flu has impacted retail sales trends and sales trends at KFC through the date of this Form 10 K. Based on information as of the date of this Form 10 K, the Company believes that the most likely effect of avian flu 35 outbreaks in these markets, some of which are completely franchised markets, will be short term. Additionally, the Company currently does not expect that the avian flu outbreak will materially affect its chicken supply in Asia or other markets. Our most significant market that has been affected by the avian flu is China. As we have previously stated, if the avian flu outbreak were to affect the entire country of China for up to two months (through the end of March, 2004) with sales declines in the range of 20% at KFC, 2004 diluted EPS results for the Company would be unfavorably impacted by up to $0.02. We have incorporated this potential unfavorable impact in our operating plans and outlook. AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits) During 2004, we expect to recover approximately $10 million related to recoveries from the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. We expect that this will substantially complete our recoveries related to the AmeriServe bankruptcy reorganization process. See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other charges (credits). Critical Accounting Policies Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgements could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level. Restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant). Our semi annual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. These impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant, which can be for a period of over 20 years, and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the long lived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is our cost of capital, adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist. When it is probable that we will sell a restaurant, we write down the restaurant to its fair value. We often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform impairment evaluations at the group level. Fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs. Estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary. In addition, we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows 36 before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants. The fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates is generally significantly in excess of their carrying value. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting units over twenty years plus an expected terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit. For 2003, there was no impairment of goodwill identified during our annual impairment testing. For our reporting units with goodwill, the fair value is generally significantly in excess of the recorded carrying value. Thus, we do not believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given current business performance. For 2002, we impaired $5 million of goodwill related to the Pizza Hut France reporting unit. Our impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. Our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of values assigned to trademarks/brands of which we have acquired ownership (or the right to a perpetual royalty free license in the case of A&W). We believe the value of these trademarks/brands is derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or receive, in the case of franchise stores, due to our ownership of or royalty free license of the trademarks/brands. Thus, anticipated sales are the most important assumption in valuing trademarks/brands. We limit assumptions about sales growth, as well as other factors impacting the fair value calculation, to those that are supportable based on our plans for the applicable Concept. The most significant recorded trademark/brand assets resulted when we acquired YGR in 2002. Upon this acquisition, $140 million and $72 million were allocated to the LJS and A&W trademarks/brands, respectively. The results generated to date from the YGR acquisition on an overall basis have met our expectations. We also now believe opportunities exist beyond those assumed in justification of our acquisition price with regard to increased penetration of LJS, for both stand alone units and as a multibrand partner. Accordingly, we now believe our systems development capital, at least through the term of our current projections, will be primarily directed towards LJS. The decision to focus short term development on increased penetration of LJS and discretionary capital spending limits have resulted in less than originally planned development of A&W in the near term. Additionally, while we continue to view A&W as a viable multibrand partner, subsequent to acquisition we decided to close or refranchise all Company owned A&W restaurants that we had acquired. These restaurants were low volume, mall based units, that were inconsistent with the remainder of our Company owned portfolio. We incorporated these plans into our fair value estimates of the LJS and A&W trademarks/brands in 2003. As sales projections for LJS were in excess of those originally assumed when valuing the LJS trademark/brand, the trademark/brands current fair value is in excess of its carrying value. Both the decision to close the Company owned A&W units and the decision to focus on short term development opportunities at LJS negatively impacted the fair value of the A&W trademark/brand. Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $5 million in 2003 to write the value of A&W trademark/brand down to its fair value. While we believe the sales assumptions used in our determination of the fair value of the A&W trademark/brand are reasonable and consistent with our operating plans and forecasts, fluctuations in the assumptions would have impacted our impairment calculation. If the long term rate of sales growth used in our determination of the fair value of the A&W trademark/brand would have been one percentage point higher, the trademark/brand would not have been impaired. Alternatively, if the long term rate of sales growth would have been one percentage point lower, additional impairment of approximately $4 million would have been recognized. 37 See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables and Contingent Liabilities We reserve a franchisees or licensees entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 27, 2003. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. Primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts, we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees. We record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable. At December 27, 2003, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with $326 million representing the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 27, 2003, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts. See Note 24 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees. Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty claims. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 24 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves At December 27, 2003, we have a valuation allowance of $183 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $231 million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. The estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes. 38 Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately $3 million and $6 million, respectively, in annual income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 would decrease approximately $5 million and $8 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 would decrease approximately $87 million and $93 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk International operating profit constitutes approximately 36% of our operating profit in 2003, excluding unallocated and corporate expenses. In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1.3 billion as of December 27, 2003. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 27, 2003, operating profit would have decreased $49 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical and holding cash in local currencies when possible. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a limited basis, commodity 39 future and option contracts. Commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended December 27, 2003, and December 28, 2002, did not significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cautionary Statements From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements, we present forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
