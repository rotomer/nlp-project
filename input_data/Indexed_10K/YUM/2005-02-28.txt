Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as YUM or the Company) comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers (LJS) and A&W All American Food Restaurants (A&W) (collectively the Concepts) and is the worlds largest quick service restaurant (QSR) company based on the number of system units. LJS and A&W were added when YUM acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. (YGR) on May 7, 2002. With 12,998 international units, YUM is the second largest QSR company outside the U.S. YUM became an independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the Spin off Date) via a tax free distribution of our Common Stock (the Distribution or Spin off) to the shareholders of our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo). Through its Concepts, YUM develops, operates, franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and non traditional QSR restaurants. Traditional units feature dine in, carryout and, in some instances, drive thru or delivery services. Non traditional units, which are typically licensed outlets, include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. The retail food industry, in which the Company competes, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, convenience, location and concept. The industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Each of the Concepts compete with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally owned restaurants, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees. The Companys key strategies are: Building dominant restaurant brands in China Driving profitable international expansion Improving restaurant operations Multibranding category leading brands The Company is focused on five long term measures identified as essential to our growth and progress. These five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows: International expansion International system sales growth (local currency) Number of new international restaurant openings Net international unit growth 21 Multibrand innovation and expansion Number of multibrand restaurant locations Number of multibrand units added Number of franchise multibrand units added Portfolio of category leading U.S. brands U.S. blended same store sales growth U.S. system sales growth Global franchise fees New restaurant openings by franchisees Franchise fee growth Strong cash generation and returns Cash generated from all sources Cash generated from all sources after capital spending Restaurant margins Our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). Throughout the MD&A, the Company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 46 through 49 and the Cautionary Statements on pages 43 and 44. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 50 through 84. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Factors Affecting Comparability of 2004 Results to 2003 Results and 2003 Results to 2002 Results Lease Accounting Adjustments In late 2004 and early 2005, a number of companies within the QSR industry announced adjustments to their accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements. In consultation with our external auditors, we also determined that an adjustment was necessary to modify our accounting in these areas. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an adjustment such that all of our leasehold improvements are now being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease, including options in some instances, over which we are recording rent expense, including escalations, on a straight line basis. The cumulative adjustment, primarily through increased U.S. depreciation expense, totaled $11.5 million ($7 million after tax). The portions of this adjustment that related to 2004 full year and 2004 fourth quarter were approximately $3 million and $1 million, respectively. As the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to any of those prior period financial statements, the entire adjustment was recorded in the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements. We anticipate that the impact of this accounting change will result in additional expense of $3 million in 2005. 22 YGR Acquisition On May 7, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of YGR, the parent company of LJS and A&W. See Note 4 for a discussion of the acquisition. As of the date of the acquisition, YGR consisted of 742 and 496 company and franchise LJS units, respectively, and 127 and 742 company and franchise A&W units, respectively. In addition, 133 multibranded LJS/A&W restaurants were included in the LJS unit totals. Except as discussed in certain sections of the MD&A, the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in 2003 was not significant relative to 2002. Amendment of Sale Leaseback Agreements As discussed in Note 14, on August 15, 2003 we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of YGR such that the agreements now qualify for sale leaseback accounting. Restaurant profit decreased by $5 million and by $3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment. The decrease in restaurant profit was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense. Canada Unconsolidated Affiliate Dissolution On November 10, 2003, we dissolved our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated 733 restaurants in Canada. We owned 50% of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method. Of the restaurants previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate, we now operate the vast majority of Pizza Huts and Taco Bells, while almost all KFCs are operated by franchisees. As a result of operating certain restaurants that were previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate, our Company sales, restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses increased and our franchise fees decreased. Additionally, on a full year basis other income increased as we recorded a loss from our investment in the Canadian unconsolidated affiliate in 2003. As a result of the dissolution of our Canadian unconsolidated affiliate, Company sales increased $147 million, franchise fees decreased $9 million, restaurant profit increased $8 million, general and administrative expenses increased $11 million and other income increased $4 million for the year ended December 25, 2004 compared to the year ended December 27, 2003. The impact on 2004 net income was not significant. The impact of the dissolution on our 2003 results was also not significant. Sale of Puerto Rico Business Our Puerto Rico business was held for sale since the fourth quarter of 2002 and was sold on October 4, 2004 for an amount approximating its then carrying value. Company sales and restaurant profit decreased $27 million and $4 million, respectively, franchise fees increased $1 million and general and administrative expenses decreased $1 million for the year ended December 25, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 27, 2003. Commodity Inflation The increased cost of certain commodities negatively impacted our U.S. margins for the year ended December 25, 2004. Higher commodity costs, particularly in cheese and meat prices, negatively impacted U.S. restaurant margins as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points for the year ended December 25, 2004. 23 Wrench Litigation We recorded income of $14 million in 2004 and expense of $42 million in 2003. See Note 24 for a discussion of the Wrench litigation. AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits) We recorded income of $16 million in 2004, $26 million in 2003 and $27 million in 2002. See Note 7 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other charges (credits). Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of key U.S. and International markets. Such refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. The following table summarizes our refranchising activities: 2004 2003 2002 Number of units refranchised 317 228 174 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 140 $ 92 $ 81 Refranchising net gains, pre tax(a) $ 12 $ 4 $ 19 (a) Refranchising net gains for the year ended December 25, 2004 include charges to write down our Puerto Rico business to our then estimate of its fair value and charges to write down certain U.S. restaurants we currently own but we have offered to sell at amounts lower than their carrying values. Refranchising net gains for the year ended December 27, 2003 also include charges to write down our Puerto Rico business to our then estimate of its fair value. As previously noted, we sold our Puerto Rico business effective October 4, 2004 for an amount approximating its then carrying value. In addition to our refranchising program, from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing, we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit (collectively store closures). The following table summarizes Company store closure activities: 2004 2003 2002 Number of units closed 319 287 224 Store closure costs (income)(a) $ (3 ) $ 6 $ 15 Impairment charges for stores to be closed $ 5 $ 12 $ 9 (a) Store closure income in 2004 is primarily the result of gains from the sale of properties on which we formerly operated restaurants. 24 The impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and Company store closures is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and general and administrative expenses and (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit. The following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising and Company store closures: 2004 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased sales $ (241 ) $ (131 ) $ (372 ) Increased franchise fees 7 5 12 Decrease in total revenues $ (234 ) $ (126 ) $ (360 ) 2003 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased sales $ (148 ) $ (120 ) $ (268 ) Increased franchise fees 1 5 6 Decrease in total revenues $ (147 ) $ (115 ) $ (262 ) The following table summarizes the estimated impact on operating profit of refranchising and Company store closures: 2004 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (18 ) $ (11 ) $ (29 ) Increased franchise fees 7 5 12 Decreased general and administrative expenses 6 6 Decrease in operating profit $ (11 ) $ $ (11 ) 2003 U.S. International Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (18 ) $ (15 ) $ (33 ) Increased franchise fees 1 5 6 Decreased general and administrative expenses 6 6 Decrease in operating profit $ (17 ) $ (4 ) $ (21 ) 25 Results of Operations 2004 % B/(W)vs. 2003 2003 % B/(W)vs. 2002 Company sales $ 7,992 7 $ 7,441 8 Franchise and license fees 1,019 8 939 9 Revenues $ 9,011 8 $ 8,380 8 Company restaurant profit $ 1,159 5 $ 1,104 % of Company sales 14.5 % (0.3 ) ppts. 14.8 % (1.2 ) ppts.

The above totals exclude 206 licensed units at both the end of 2004 and 2003. 27 Included in the above totals are multibrand restaurants. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. Franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units. Multibrand restaurant totals were as follows: 2004 Company Franchise Total United States 1,391 1,250 2,641 International 28 155 183 Worldwide 1,419 1,405 2,824 2003 Company Franchise Total United States 1,032 1,116 2,148 International 52 127 179 Worldwide 1,084 1,243 2,327 For 2004 and 2003, Company multibrand unit gross additions were 384 and 235, respectively. For 2004 and 2003, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 169 and 194, respectively. System Sales Growth Increase Increase excluding currency translation 2004 2003 2004 2003 United States 3 % 3 % N/ A N/ A International 15 % 14 % 9 % 7 % Worldwide 8 % 7 % 5 % 5 % System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. In 2004, the increase in Worldwide system sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Excluding the favorable impact from both foreign currency translation and the YGR acquisition, Worldwide system sales increased 3% in 2003. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures. In 2004, the increase in U.S. system sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, U.S. system sales increased 1% in 2003. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures. In 2004, the increase in International system sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. In 2003, the increase in International system sales was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures. 28 Revenues Amount % Increase % Increase excludingcurrency translation 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Company sales United States $ 5,163 $ 5,081 2 6 N/A N/A International 2,829 2,360 20 12 16 8 Worldwide 7,992 7,441 7 8 6 7 Franchise and license fees United States 600 574 4 1 N/A N/A International 419 365 15 23 8 14 Worldwide 1,019 939 8 9 6 6 Total revenues United States 5,763 5,655 2 6 N/A N/A International 3,248 2,725 19 13 15 8 Worldwide $ 9,011 $ 8,380 8 8 6 7 In 2004, the increase in Worldwide Company sales was driven by new unit development, acquisitions of franchisee restaurants (primarily certain units in Canada which we now operate), and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. Excluding the favorable impact of both foreign currency translation and the YGR acquisition, Worldwide Company sales increased 4% in 2003. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures and refranchising. In 2004, the increase in Worldwide franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth, and refranchising, partially offset by store closures and acquisitions of franchisee restaurants (primarily certain units in Canada which we now operate). Excluding the favorable impact of both foreign currency translation and the YGR acquisition, Worldwide franchise and license fees increased 5% in 2003. The increase was driven by new unit development, royalty rate increases and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. In 2004, the increase in U.S. Company sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, U.S. Company sales increased 2% in 2003. The increase was driven by new unit development, partially offset by store closures and refranchising. 29 U.S same store sales includes only Company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same store sales includes KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Company owned restaurants only. U.S. same store sales for Long John Silvers and A&W restaurants are not included.

In 2003, blended Company same store sales were flat due to a decrease in transactions offset by an increase in average guest check. In 2004, the increase in U.S. franchise and license fees was driven by same store sales growth, new unit development and refranchising, partially offset by store closures. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, U.S. franchise and license fees remained essentially flat in 2003 as a decrease primarily driven by store closures was largely offset by new unit development. In 2004, the increase in International Company sales was driven by new unit development, acquisitions of franchisee restaurants (primarily certain units in Canada which we now operate), and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. In 2003, the increase in International Company sales was driven by new unit development, partially offset by refranchising, same store sales declines and store closures. In 2004, the increase in International franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and refranchising, partially offset by store closures and our acquisitions of franchisee restaurants (primarily certain units in Canada which we now operate). In 2003, the increase in International franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, royalty rate increases and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures.

Higher food and paper costs were primarily driven by increased commodity costs (principally cheese and meats) and higher occupancy and other costs were primarily driven by increased expense resulting from the adjustment related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements. In 2003, the decrease in U.S. restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by the increased occupancy expenses due to higher rent, primarily due to additional rent expense associated with the amended YGR sale leaseback agreements, and utilities. The higher food and paper costs were primarily due to the impact of unfavorable discounting and product mix. Also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs, primarily driven by low single digit increases in wage rates. In 2004, the increase in International restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales increases on restaurant margin and lower food and paper costs (principally due to supply chain savings). The increase was partially offset by a 60 basis point unfavorable impact of operating certain restaurants in Canada, which is a market with below average margins, that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate, increased labor costs in certain markets and a 10 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. In 2003, the decrease in International restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact on margin of same store sales declines and a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of supply chain savings on the cost of food and paper (principally in China), and the cessation of depreciation expense of approximately $9 million for the Puerto Rico business while it was held for sale. The impact from foreign currency translation on margins as a percentage of sales is a result of the portfolio of markets effect. International margin percentages in total are impacted unfavorably when currencies strengthen in markets with below average margins. Those markets contributing to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation on margin have below average margins largely due to their higher labor costs. Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $111 million or 12% in 2004, including a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by higher compensation related costs, including incentive compensation, amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets and pension costs. Also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees and increased reserves related to potential development sites and surplus facilities. The increase was also partially attributable to expenses of $11 million associated with operating the restaurants we now own in Canada that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate. These increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses due to the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants. 31 General and administrative expenses increased $32 million or 3% in 2003, including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact from both foreign currency translation and the YGR acquisition, general and administrative expenses were flat for 2003. Lower management incentive compensation costs were offset by increases in expenses associated with international restaurant expansion and pension expense. Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses decreased $2 million or 8% in 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lapping the biennial International franchise convention held in 2003. Franchise and license expenses decreased $21 million or 42% in 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower allowances for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables, principally at Taco Bell. Worldwide Other (Income) Expense 2004 2003 2002 Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ (54 ) $ (39 ) $ (29 ) Foreign exchange net (gain) loss (1 ) (2 ) (1 ) Other (income) expense $ (55 ) $ (41 ) $ (30 ) Other income increased $14 million or 34% in 2004, including a 7% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates, principally in China, and the dissolution of our unconsolidated affiliate in Canada which recorded a loss for the year ended December 27, 2003. Other income increased $11 million or 39% in 2003, including a 6% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates, particularly in China. Worldwide Facility Actions We recorded a net loss from facility actions of $26 million, $36 million and $32 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See the Store Portfolio Strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and Note 7 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment. 32 Operating Profit % Increase/(decrease) 2004 2003 2004 2003 United States $ 777 $ 812 (4 ) 1 International 542 441 23 22 Unallocated and corporate expenses (204 ) (179 ) (14 ) Unallocated other income (expense) (2 ) (3 ) NM NM Unallocated facility actions 12 4 NM NM Wrench litigation income (expense) 14 (42 ) NM NM AmeriServe and other (charges) credits 16 26 NM NM Operating profit $ 1,155 $ 1,059 9 3 In 2004, the decrease in U.S. operating profit was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of higher commodity costs (primarily cheese and meat) and the adjustment recorded related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements, as well as higher general and administrative expenses. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales increases on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees. Excluding the favorable impact of the YGR acquisition, U.S. operating profit in 2003 was flat compared to 2002. Decreases driven by lower restaurant profit as a result of increased occupancy expenses and the impact of unfavorable discounting and product mix shift on food and paper costs were offset by lower franchise and license and general and administrative expenses. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, International operating profit increased 17% in 2004. The increase was driven by new unit development, the impact of same store sales increases on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees and higher income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by higher general and administrative costs. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, International operating profit increased 15% in 2003. The increase was driven by new unit development and the impact of supply chain savings initiatives on the cost of food and paper, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines on restaurant profit and higher general and administrative expenses. Unallocated and corporate expenses comprise general and administrative expenses and unallocated facility actions comprise refranchising gains (losses), neither of which are allocated to the U.S. or International segments for performance reporting purposes. Interest Expense, Net 2004 2003 2002 Interest expense $ 145 $ 185 $ 180 Interest income (16 ) (12 ) (8 ) Interest expense, net $ 129 $ 173 $ 172 Interest expense decreased $40 million or 22% in 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our average interest rates primarily attributable to pay variable interest rate swaps entered into during 2004. Also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in our average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the amended YGR sale leaseback agreement and lower International short term borrowings. Interest expense increased $5 million or 3% in 2003. Excluding the impact of the YGR acquisition, interest expense decreased 6%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our average debt outstanding. 33 Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 Reported Income taxes $ 286 $ 268 $ 275 Effective tax rate 27.9 % 30.2 % 32.1 % The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2004 2003 2002 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 1.3 1.8 2.0 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (5.8 ) (3.6 ) (2.8 ) Adjustments to reserves and prior years (6.7 ) (1.7 ) (1.8 ) Foreign tax credit amended return benefit (4.1 ) Valuation allowance additions (reversals) 4.2 2.8 Other, net (0.1 ) (0.3 ) Effective tax rate 27.9 % 30.2 % 32.1 % Income taxes and the effective tax rate as shown above reflect tax on all amounts included in our results of operations except for the income tax benefit of approximately $1 million on the $2 million cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the year ended December 27, 2003 due to the adoption of SFAS 143. The 2004 effective tax rate decreased 2.3 percentage points to 27.9%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors, including the reversal of reserves in the current year associated with audits that were settled as well as the effects of certain international tax planning strategies implemented in 2004. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping the benefit in 2003 of amending certain prior U.S. income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years as well as the recognition in 2004 of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not. The 2003 effective tax rate decreased 1.9 percentage points to 30.2%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a 4.1 percentage point benefit of amending certain prior U.S. income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years. The returns were amended upon our determination that it was more beneficial to claim credit for such taxes than to deduct such taxes, as had been done when the returns were originally filed. In future years, we anticipate continuing to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in the then current year, as we have done in 2004, 2003 and 2002. However, the amended return benefit recognized in 2003 was non recurring. The decrease in the 2003 effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not. See Note 22 for a discussion of valuation allowances. Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, that we believe may impact our exposure. 34 Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,131 million compared to $1,053 million in 2003. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income and a decrease in the amount of voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan compared to 2003, partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2004. In 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,053 million compared to $1,088 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily driven by $130 million in voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan in 2003, partially offset by higher net income. Net cash used in investing activities was $486 million versus $519 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and lower capital spending compared to 2003, partially offset by the impact of the timing of purchases and sales of short term investments. In 2003, net cash used in investing activities was $519 million versus $885 million in 2002. The decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the $275 million acquisition of YGR in 2002 and lower capital spending in 2003. Net cash used in financing activities was $779 million versus $475 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily driven by higher share repurchases, higher net debt repayments and the payment of two quarterly dividends, partially offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises. In 2003, net cash used in financing activities was $475 million versus $187 million in 2002. The increase was primarily driven by higher net debt repayments and higher shares repurchased in 2003. Consolidated Financial Condition Assets increased $76 million or 1% to $5.7 billion primarily due to an increase in property, plant and equipment driven by capital expenditures in excess of depreciation. The increase was also partially driven by the existence of a federal income tax receivable at December 25, 2004 recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the timing of the collection of certain accounts receivable. The increase was partially offset by the impact of higher spending for financing activities compared to 2003, as described above, and a decrease in other assets as a result of the utilization of deferred income tax assets in 2004. Liabilities decreased $399 million or 9% to $4.1 billion primarily due to lower long term debt as a result of the early redemption of our 2005 Senior Unsecured Notes of $350 million in 2004 and lower income taxes payable due to the excess of current year tax payments made over the current year provision. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last three fiscal years, net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion. These cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending, while at the same time reducing our long term debt balances. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations, we believe our operating cash flows, our ability to reduce discretionary spending, and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2005 and beyond. 35 We initiated the payment of quarterly dividends in 2004 with two quarterly dividends paid totaling $58 million. Additionally, on November 12, 2004 our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock to be distributed on February 4, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 14, 2005. On an annual basis, the Company is targeting a payout ratio of 15% to 20% of net income. On September 7, 2004, the Company executed an amended and restated five year senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) totaling $1.0 billion which replaced a $1.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the Old Facility) with a maturity date of June 25, 2005. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit. At December 25, 2004, our unused Credit Facility totaled $776 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $205 million. There were borrowings of $19 million outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 25, 2004. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.35% to 1.625% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or 0.00% to 0.20% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, will depend upon our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, level of cash dividends, aggregate non U.S. investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement. These covenants are substantially similar to those contained in the Old Facility. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 25, 2004, and do not anticipate that the covenants will impact our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility for its remaining term. The remainder of our long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $1.5 billion at December 25, 2004. On November 15, 2004, we voluntarily redeemed all of our 7.45% Senior Unsecured Notes due in May 2005 (the 2005 Notes) in accordance with their original terms. The 2005 Notes, which had a face value of $350 million, were redeemed for an amount of approximately $358 million using primarily cash on hand as well as some borrowings under our Credit Facility. The redemption amount approximated the carrying value of the 2005 Notes resulting in no significant impact on net income. We estimate that in 2005 capital spending, including acquisitions of our restaurants from franchisees, will be approximately $780 million. We also estimate that in 2005 refranchising proceeds, prior to taxes, will be approximately $100 million, employee stock options proceeds, prior to taxes, will be approximately $150 million and sales of property, plant and equipment will be approximately $80 million. A share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in May 2004 is expected to be completed during the first half of 2005. At December 25, 2004, we had remaining capacity to repurchase, through November 2005, up to approximately $25 million of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under this program. In January 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of the Companys outstanding common stock to be purchased through January 2006. 36 In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 25, 2004 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt(a) $ 1,598 $ 1 $ 204 $ 275 $ 1,118 Capital leases(b) 184 18 32 28 106 Operating leases(b) 2,511 342 564 442 1,163 Purchase obligations(c) 233 138 39 30 26 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP 30 18 4 8 Total contractual obligations $ 4,556 $ 499 $ 857 $ 779 $ 2,421 (a) Excludes a fair value adjustment of $21 million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 14. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to approximately 5,500 restaurants. See Note 15. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology and commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as marketing, maintenance, consulting and other agreements. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. The pension plans funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets. We are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2005, but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plans expected September 30, 2005 funded status. During 2004, we made a $50 million discretionary contribution to our funded plan, none of which represented minimum funding requirements. Our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made postretirement benefit payments of $4 million in 2004. Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) as well as employee healthcare claims for which we are self insured. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had provided approximately $16 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the Companys historical refranchising programs and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants, at December 25, 2004. In support of these guarantees, we posted $4 million of letters of credit at December 25, 2004. We also provided a standby letter of credit of $18 million at December 25, 2004, under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately $90 million at December 25, 2004. 37 Any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss (gain). New loans are not currently being added to either loan pool. We have guaranteed certain lines of credit and loans of unconsolidated affiliates totaling $34 million at December 25, 2004. Our unconsolidated affiliates had total revenues of over $1.7 billion for the year ended December 25, 2004 and assets and debt of approximately $884 million and $49 million, respectively, at December 25, 2004. Other Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Expected to Impact 2005 Operating Profit Comparisons with 2004 New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R) in 2005, we will be required to recognize compensation cost in the financial statements for all share based payments to our employees, including grants of stock options, based on the fair value of the share based awards on the date of grant. The fair value of the share based awards will be determined using option pricing models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards. Compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest. SFAS 123R is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005 (the quarter ending December 31, 2005 for the Company) and early adoption is encouraged. We are in the process of evaluating the use of certain option pricing models as well as the assumptions to be used in such models. When such evaluation is complete, we will determine the transition method to use and the timing of adoption. We currently do not anticipate that the impact on net income on a full year basis of the adoption of SFAS 123R will be significantly different from the historical pro forma impacts as previously disclosed. See Note 2. Sale of Puerto Rico Business As a result of the sale of our Puerto Rico business on October 4, 2004, Company sales, restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses will decrease by $159 million, $29 million and $8 million, respectively, and we estimate franchise fees will increase by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 25, 2004. Extra Week in 2005 Our fiscal calendar results in a fifty third week every five or six years. Fiscal year 2005 will include a fifty third week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our U.S. businesses as well as our International businesses that report on a period, as opposed to a monthly, basis. In the U.S., we anticipate permanently accelerating the timing of the KFC business closing by one week in December 2005, and thus, there will be no fifty third week benefit for this business in 2005. We estimate the fifty third week will increase revenues and operating profit in 2005 by approximately $80 million and $15 million, respectively. While the impact of the fifty third week adds a potential incremental benefit of $0.04 to diluted earnings per share, we believe this benefit will be offset by expense associated with strategic asset actions and refranchising KFC restaurants in the U.S. 38 International Reporting Changes In the first quarter of 2005 we will begin reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. The China Division will include the Peoples Republic of China (China), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division will include the remainder of our international operations. This reporting change will not impact our consolidated results. In the first quarter of 2005 we will also change the China business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our U.S. business. Previously our China business, like the rest of our international businesses, closed one month (or one period for certain of our international businesses) earlier than YUMs period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. As a result, the operations of the China business for the one month period ending December 31, 2004 will be recognized as an adjustment to consolidated retained earnings in the first quarter of 2005, as opposed to being recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Income, to maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations. Our consolidated results of operations for the first quarter of 2005 will thus include the results of operations of the China business for the months of January and February and the months included in each quarterly reporting period thereafter will begin one month later in 2005 than in previous years. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value). Our semi annual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. These impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant, which can be for a period of over 20 years, and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the long lived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is our cost of capital, adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist. When it is probable that we will sell a restaurant within one year, we write down the restaurant to its fair value. We often refranchise restaurants in groups and, therefore, perform such impairment evaluations at the group level. Fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs. Estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. 39 Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary. In addition, we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants. The fair values of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are generally significantly in excess of their carrying value. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit. For 2004, there was no impairment of goodwill identified during our annual impairment testing. Our impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. Our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of values assigned to certain trademarks/brands of which we have acquired ownership. We believe the value of these trademarks/brands is derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or receive, in the case of franchise stores, due to our ownership of the trademarks/brands. Thus, anticipated sales are the most important assumption in valuing trademarks/brands. We limit assumptions about sales growth, as well as other factors impacting the fair value calculation, to those that are supportable based on our plans for the applicable Concept. The most significant indefinite lived trademark/brand asset we have recorded is the LJS trademark/brand in the amount of $140 million. The fair value of this trademark/brand is currently in excess of its carrying value as are the fair values of all other recorded trademarks/brands with an indefinite life. While we believe the sales assumptions used in our determinations of fair value for our trademarks/brands are consistent with our operating plans and forecasts, fluctuations in the assumptions would have impacted our impairment calculation. If the long term rate of sales growth used in each of our fair value determinations for our trademarks/brands had been one percentage point lower, such fair values would have continued to exceed carrying value in all instances. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables and Contingent Liabilities We reserve a franchisees or licensees entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 25, 2004. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. 40 Primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts, we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees. We record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable. At December 25, 2004, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with $306 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 25, 2004. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts. See Note 24 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees. Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty claims. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 24 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after September 30, 2001 are not eligible to participate. As of our September 30, 2004 measurement date, these plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $700 million, an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) of $629 million and a fair value of plan assets of $518 million. As a result of the $111 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the ABO at September 30, 2004, we have recorded a cumulative $95 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss (net of tax of $58 million) as of December 25, 2004. The PBO and ABO reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees. The PBO incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the ABO reflects only current compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBO and ABO are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. We measured our PBO and ABO using a discount rate of 6.15% at September 30, 2004. This discount rate was determined using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities that mirror our expected benefit obligations under the plans. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our PBO by approximately $63 million at September 30, 2004. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our PBO by approximately $65 million at September 30, 2004. The pension expense we will record in 2005 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at September 30, 2004. In total, we expect pension expense to increase approximately $3 million to $56 million in 2005. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in interest cost because of the higher PBO. Service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate, though, as previously mentioned, the plans are closed to new participants. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 6.15% at September 30, 2004 would impact our 2005 pension expense by approximately $12 million. The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rate of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our expected long term rate of return on plan assets at both September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003 was 8.5%. We believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. Given no change to the market related value of our plan assets as of September 30, 2004, a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our 2005 pension plan expense by approximately $5 million. 41 The losses our plan assets have experienced, along with the decrease in discount rates, have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of $225 million in our plans as of September 30, 2004. For purposes of determining 2004 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $19 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2004. We will recognize approximately $22 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2005. Given no change to the assumptions at our September 30, 2004 measurement date, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2005 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline. Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves At December 25, 2004, we have a valuation allowance of $351 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $231 million and our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. The estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 22 for a further discussion of our income taxes. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $6 million and $3 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 would decrease approximately $51 million and $5 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 would decrease approximately $76 million and $87 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows. 42 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk International operating profit constitutes approximately 41% of our operating profit in 2004, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 25, 2004. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 25, 2004, operating profit would have decreased $59 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical and holding cash in local currencies when possible. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a limited basis, commodity future and option contracts. Commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2004, and December 27, 2003, did not significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
