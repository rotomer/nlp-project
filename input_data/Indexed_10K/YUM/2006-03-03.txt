Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview YUM! Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (collectively referred to as YUM or the Company) comprises the worldwide operations of KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers (LJS) and A&W All American Food Restaurants (A&W) (collectively the Concepts) and is the worlds largest quick service restaurant (QSR) company based on the number of system units. LJS and A&W were added when YUM acquired Yorkshire Global Restaurants, Inc. (YGR) on May 7, 2002. YUM is the second largest QSR company outside the U.S. with over 13,800 units. YUM became an independent, publicly owned company on October 6, 1997 (the Spin off Date) via a tax free distribution of our Common Stock (the Distribution or Spin off) to the shareholders of our former parent, PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo). Through its Concepts, YUM develops, operates, franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and non traditional QSR restaurants. Traditional units feature dine in, carryout and, in some instances, drive thru or delivery services. Non traditional units, which are typically licensed outlets, include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums, amusement parks and colleges, where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. The retail food industry, in which the Company competes, is made up of supermarkets, supercenters, warehouse stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, snack bars, delicatessens and restaurants (including the QSR segment), and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, convenience, location and concept. The industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Each of the Concepts compete with international, national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally owned restaurants, not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees. Our business consists of three reporting segments: United States, the International Division and the China Division. The China Division includes mainland China (China), Thailand and KFC Taiwan and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. The Companys key strategies are: Building dominant restaurant brands in China Driving profitable international expansion Improving restaurant operations Multibranding category leading brands The Company is focused on five long term measures identified as essential to our growth and progress. These five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows: China Division and International Division expansion China Division and International Division system sales growth (local currency) Number of new China Division and International Division restaurant openings Net China Division and International Division unit growth Multibrand innovation and expansion Number of multibrand restaurant locations Number of multibrand units added Number of franchise multibrand units added 25 Portfolio of category leading U.S. brands U.S. blended same store sales growth U.S. system sales growth Global franchise fees New restaurant openings by franchisees Franchise fee growth Strong cash generation and returns Cash generated from all sources Cash generated from all sources after capital spending Restaurant margins Our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). Throughout the MD&A, the Company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 56 through 59 and the Cautionary Statements on page 52. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 60 through 96. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Factors Affecting Comparability of 2005 Results to 2004 Results and 2004 Results to 2003 Results International Reporting Changes In 2005, we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. The China Division includes mainland China (China), Thailand and KFC Taiwan, and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation. Beginning in 2005, we also changed the China business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our U.S. business. Previously our China business, like the rest of our international businesses, closed one month (or one period for certain of our international businesses) earlier than YUMs period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting. To maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations, amounts related to our China business for December 2004 have not been reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income and net income of the China business of $6 million for the one month period ending December 31, 2004 was recognized as an adjustment directly to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended December 31, 2005. Our consolidated results of operations for the year to date ended December 31, 2005 include the results of operations of the China business for the months of January, 2005 through December, 2005. Our consolidated results of operations for the years to date ended December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 continue to include the results of operations of the China business for the months December, 2003 through November, 2004 and December, 2002 through November, 2003, respectively, as previously reported. 26 Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment In the fourth quarter 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123), supersedes APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. The provisions of SFAS 123R are similar to those of SFAS 123, however, SFAS 123R requires all new, modified and unvested share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock, be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straight line basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified retrospective application transition method effective September 4, 2005, the beginning of our fourth quarter. As permitted by SFAS 123R, we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (our fiscal year 2005). As such, the first three fiscal quarters of 2005 are required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of SFAS 123. However, years prior to 2005 have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in the reduction of operating profit of $58 million ($10 million in payroll and employee benefits and $48 million in general and administrative expense), a reduction of net income of $38 million (net of tax benefits of $20 million), a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.13 per share, a reduction of $87 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of $87 million in cash flows from financing activities. The following table shows the 2005 quarterly after tax effect of adoption of SFAS 123R on the previously reported first three quarters of 2005. First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Net Income Diluted EPS Net Income Diluted EPS Net Income Diluted EPS Reported results prior to SFAS 123R adoption $ 161 $ 0.53 $ 187 $ 0.62 $ 214 $ 0.72 Impact of SFAS 123R adoption (8) (0.03) (9) (0.03) (9) (0.03) Results subsequent to SFAS 123R adoption $ 153 $ 0.50 $ 178 $ 0.59 $ 205 $ 0.69 We also have included the following tables detailing the additional expense by quarter, by segment and by financial statement line item of the impact of adoption of SFAS 123R as well as the related decrease in operating profit, income tax benefit and decrease in net income. The numbers as presented have been rounded to accommodate our financial statement presentation conventions. However, unrounded expense by segment is relatively consistent throughout all quarters relative to actual number of days in the quarter. Quarter ended March 19, 2005 U.S. International China Unallocated Total Payroll and employee benefits $ 2 $ 1 $ $ $ 3 General and administrative 3 2 1 4 10 Operating profit $ 5 $ 3 $ 1 $ 4 13 Income tax benefit (5) Net income impact $ 8 27 Quarter ended June 11, 2005 U.S. International China Unallocated Total Payroll and employee benefits $ 2 $ $ $ $ 2 General and administrative 3 2 1 5 11 Operating profit $ 5 $ 2 $ 1 $ 5 13 Income tax benefit (4) Net income impact $ 9 Quarter ended September 4, 2005 U.S. International China Unallocated Total Payroll and employee benefits $ 2 $ $ $ $ 2 General and administrative 4 3 1 4 12 Operating profit $ 6 $ 3 $ 1 $ 4 14 Income tax benefit (5) Net income impact $ 9 Quarter ended December 31, 2005 U.S. International China Unallocated Total Payroll and employee benefits $ 2 $ 1 $ $ $ 3 General and administrative 4 4 1 6 15 Operating profit $ 6 $ 5 $ 1 $ 6 18 Income tax benefit (6) Net income impact $ 12 Year ended December 31, 2005 U.S. International China Unallocated Total Payroll and employee benefits $ 8 $ 2 $ $ $ 10 General and administrative 14 11 4 19 48 Operating profit $ 22 $ 13 $ 4 $ 19 58 Income tax benefit (20) Net income impact $ 38 Prior to 2005, all stock options granted were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and its related Interpretations. Accordingly, no stock based employee compensation expense was reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for stock options, as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Had the Company applied the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 to stock options in 2004 and 2003, net income of $740 million and $617 million, respectively, would have been reduced by $37 million and $38 million, respectively, to $703 million and $579 million, respectively. Additionally, both basic and diluted earnings per common share would have decreased $0.12 per share for both 2004 and 2003. 28 Extra Week in 2005 Our fiscal calendar results in a 53rd week every five or six years. Fiscal year 2005 includes a 53rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our U.S. businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period, as opposed to a monthly, basis. In the U.S., we permanently accelerated the timing of the KFC business closing by one week in December 2005, and thus, there was no 53rd week benefit for this business. Additionally, all China Division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53rd week. The following table summarizes the estimated increase (decrease) of the 53rd week on revenues and operating profit: U.S. International Division Unallocated Total Revenues Company sales $ 58 $ 27 $ $ 85 Franchise and license fees 8 3 11 Total Revenues $ 66 $ 30 $ $ 96 Operating profit Franchise and license fees $ 8 $ 3 $ $ 11 Restaurant profit 14 5 19 General and administrative expenses (2 ) (3 ) (3 ) (8 ) Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates 1 1 Operating profit $ 20 $ 6 $ (3 ) $ 23 Mainland China Issues Our KFC business in mainland China was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late March, 2005 as well as consumer concerns related to Avian Flu in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result of the aforementioned issues, the China Division experienced system sales growth in 2005 of 11% excluding foreign currency translation which is below our ongoing target of at least 22%. During the year to date ended December 31, 2005, we entered into an agreement for a partial recovery of our losses related to the supplier ingredient issue with the supplier. As a result of the agreement, we recognized approximately $24 million in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005. Sale of an Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate During the second quarter of 2005, we sold our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all KFCs and Pizza Huts in Poland and the Czech Republic to our then partner in the entity, principally for cash. Concurrent with the sale, our former partner completed an initial public offering (IPO) of the majority of the stock it then owned in the entity. Prior to the sale, we accounted for our investment in this entity using the equity method. Subsequent to the IPO, the new publicly held entity, in which YUM has no ownership interest, is a franchisee as was the entity in which we previously held a fifty percent interest. This transaction generated a one time gain of approximately $11 million for YUM as cash proceeds (net of expenses) of approximately $25 million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate. As with our equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the approximate $11 million gain was recorded in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The sale did not have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in 2005 nor is it expected to have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations going forward. 29 Hurricane Katrina During the third quarter of 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused significant damage to several company and franchised stores. This storm resulted in approximately $4 million of one time costs being recorded in the full year from property damage and asset write offs related to company restaurants. Additionally, during mid September 2005, Hurricane Rita caused further damage to company and franchised stores, though to a lesser extent than Hurricane Katrina. We estimate that lost operating profits in 2005 as a result of stores being closed due to the effects of these hurricanes was approximately $3 million. We do not expect insurance recoveries, if any, related to the hurricanes to be significant. In the fourth quarter, we experienced utility costs in the U.S. that were approximately $10 million higher than in the prior year, which we believe were at least partially attributable to these hurricanes. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of 2006 with year over year utility inflation of approximately 20 percent or approximately $7 million. Sale of Puerto Rico Business Our Puerto Rico business was held for sale beginning the fourth quarter of 2002 and was sold on October 4, 2004 for an amount approximating its then carrying value. Company sales and restaurant profit decreased $159 million and $29 million, respectively, franchise fees increased $10 million and general and administrative expenses decreased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 25, 2004. Company sales and restaurant profit decreased $27 million and $4 million, respectively, franchise fees increased $1 million and general and administrative expenses decreased $1 million for the year ended December 25, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 27, 2003. Income Tax Impact of Repatriating Qualified Foreign Earnings The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act), which became law on October 22, 2004, allows a dividends received deduction of 85% of repatriated qualified foreign earnings in fiscal year 2005. We recorded $6 million in income tax expense during the year ended December 25, 2004 as a result of our then determination to repatriate approximately $110 million in 2005 which will be eligible for the Acts dividends received deduction. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provisions within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, we continued to evaluate in 2005 whether we would repatriate other undistributed earnings from foreign investments as a result of the Act. During the second quarter of 2005, we determined that we would repatriate additional qualified foreign earnings of approximately $390 million in fiscal year 2005 which will be eligible for the Acts dividends received deduction (for a total repatriation of qualified earnings of approximately $500 million). As a result of this determination, approximately $20 million of additional tax expense was recognized in fiscal 2005. No additional amounts beyond the approximately $500 million as discussed above are eligible for the Acts dividends received deduction. Lease Accounting Adjustments In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease, including options in some instances, over which we were recording rent expense, including escalations, on a straight line basis. The cumulative adjustment, primarily through increased U.S. depreciation expense, totaled $11.5 million ($7 million after tax). The portion of this adjustment that related to 2004 was approximately $3 million. As the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to any of those prior period financial statements, the entire adjustment was recorded in the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements. 30 Amendment of Sale Leaseback Agreements On August 15, 2003 we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our 2002 acquisition of YGR such that the agreements now qualify for sale leaseback accounting. Restaurant profit decreased by $5 million in 2004 versus 2003 as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment. The decrease in restaurant profit was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense. Canada Unconsolidated Affiliate Dissolution On November 10, 2003, we dissolved our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated 733 restaurants in Canada. We owned 50% of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method. Of the restaurants previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate, we now operate the vast majority of Pizza Huts and Taco Bells, while almost all KFCs are operated by franchisees. As a result of operating certain restaurants that were previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate, our Company sales, restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses increased and our franchise fees decreased in 2004 versus 2003. Additionally, on a full year basis other income increased as we recorded a loss from our investment in the Canadian unconsolidated affiliate in 2003. As a result of the dissolution of our Canadian unconsolidated affiliate, Company sales increased $147 million, franchise fees decreased $9 million, restaurant profit increased $8 million, general and administrative expenses increased $11 million and other income increased $4 million for the year ended December 25, 2004 compared to the year ended December 27, 2003. The impact on 2004 net income was not significant. Commodity Inflation Higher commodity costs, particularly in cheese and meat prices, negatively impacted U.S. restaurant margins as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points for the year ended 2004 versus the year ended 2003. Wrench Litigation We recorded income of $2 million and $14 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, and expense of $42 million in 2003. See Note 4 for a discussion of the Wrench litigation. AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits) We recorded income of $2 million, $16 million and $26 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 4 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other charges (credits). Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of key U.S. and international markets. Such refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. The following table summarizes our refranchising activities: 2005 2004 2003 Number of units refranchised 382 317 228 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 145 $ 140 $ 92 Refranchising net gains, pre tax $ 43 $ 12 $ 4 31 In addition to our refranchising program, from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing, we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit (collectively store closures). Store closure costs (income) includes the net of gains or losses on sales of real estate on which we are not currently operating a Company restaurant, lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves, and other facility related expenses from previously closed stores. The following table summarizes Company store closure activities: 2005 2004 2003 Number of units closed 246 319 287 Store closure costs (income) $ $ (3) $ 6 The impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and Company store closures is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and general and administrative expenses and (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit. The following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising and Company store closures: 2005 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased sales $ (240 ) $ (263 ) $ (15 ) $ (518 ) Increased franchise fees 8 13 21 Decrease in total revenues $ (232 ) $ (250 ) $ (15 ) $ (497 ) 2004 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased sales $ (241) $ (111) $ (20) $ (372) Increased franchise fees 7 5 12 Decrease in total revenues $ (234) $ (106) $ (20) $ (360) The following table summarizes the estimated impact on operating profit of refranchising and Company store closures: 2005 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (22 ) $ (34 ) $ (1 ) $ (57 ) Increased franchise fees 8 13 21 Decreased general and administrative expenses 1 10 11 Decrease in operating profit $ (13 ) $ (11 ) $ (1 ) $ (25 ) 32 2004 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (18) $ (9) $ (2) $ (29) Increased franchise fees 7 5 12 Decreased general and administrative expenses 6 6 Decrease in operating profit $ (11) $ 2 $ (2) $ (11) Results of Operations 2005 % B/(W) vs. 2004 2004 % B/(W) vs. 2003 Company sales $ 8,225 3 $ 7,992 7 Franchise and license fees 1,124 10 1,019 8 Revenues $ 9,349 4 $ 9,011 8 Company restaurant profit $ 1,155 $ 1,159 5 % of Company sales 14.0% (0.5 ) ppts. 14.5% (0.3 ) ppts.

Balances at the end of 2004 for the Worldwide and China unit activity have been adjusted to include December activity in mainland China due to the change in its reporting calendar. The net change was an addition of 16, 2, 1 and 19 units for company, unconsolidated, franchisees and total, respectively.

Included in the above totals are multibrand restaurants. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. Franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units. Multibrand restaurant totals were as follows: 2005 Company Franchise Total United States 1,696 1,400 3,096 International Division 17 176 193 Worldwide 1,713 1,576 3,289 2004 Company Franchise Total United States 1,391 1,250 2,641 International Division 28 155 183 Worldwide 1,419 1,405 2,824 For 2005 and 2004, Company multibrand unit gross additions were 373 and 384, respectively. For 2005 and 2004, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 171 and 169, respectively. There are no multibrand units in the China Division. 35 System Sales Growth Increase Increase excluding currency translation Increase excluding currency translation and 53rd week 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 United States 5% 3% N/A N/A 4% International Division 9% 14% 6% 6% 5% China Division 13% 23% 11% 23% 11% Worldwide 7% 8% 6% 5% 5% System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. The increase in Worldwide system sales in 2005 and 2004 was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. The increase in U.S. system sales was driven by same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. In 2004, the increase in U.S. system sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. The increase in International Division system sales in 2005 and 2004 was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. In 2005, the increase in China Division system sales was driven by new unit development, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines driven by the mainland China supplier ingredient issue and consumer concerns related to Avian Flu. In 2004, the increase in China Division system sales was primarily driven by new unit development and same store sales growth. 36 Revenues Amount % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) excluding currency translation % Increase (Decrease) excluding currency translation and 53rd week 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 Company sales United States $ 5,294 $ 5,163 3 2 N/A N/A 1 International Division 1,676 1,747 (4) 17 (8) 11 (10) China Division 1,255 1,082 16 24 14 23 14 Worldwide 8,225 7,992 3 7 2 6 1 Franchise and license fees United States 635 600 6 4 N/A N/A 5 International Division 448 381 17 14 15 7 14 China Division 41 38 8 25 7 25 7 Worldwide 1,124 1,019 10 8 9 6 8 Total revenues United States 5,929 5,763 3 2 N/A N/A 2 International Division 2,124 2,128 17 (4) 10 (5) China Division 1,296 1,120 16 24 14 24 14 Worldwide $ 9,349 $ 9,011 4 8 3 6 2 In 2005, the increase in Worldwide Company sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. In 2004, the increase in Worldwide Company sales was driven by new unit development, acquisitions of franchisee restaurants and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. In 2005, the increase in Worldwide franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and refranchising, partially offset by store closures. In 2004, the increase in Worldwide franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth, and refranchising, partially offset by store closures and acquisitions of franchisee restaurants. In 2005, the increase in U.S. Company sales was driven by same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. In 2004, the increase in U.S. Company sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. 37 U.S same store sales includes only Company restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. blended same store sales includes KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Company owned restaurants only. U.S. same store sales for Long John Silvers and A&W restaurants are not included.

In 2005 and 2004, the increase in U.S. franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and refranchising, partially offset by store closures. In 2005, the decrease in International Division Company sales was driven by refranchising (primarily our Puerto Rico business) and store closures, partially offset by new unit development. In 2004, the increase in International Division Company sales was driven by acquisitions of franchisee restaurants (primarily certain units in Canada we now operate), new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. In 2005, the increase in International Division franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, refranchising (primarily our Puerto Rico business), and royalty rate increases. In 2004, the increase in International Division franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and refranchising, partially offset by store closures and our acquisitions of franchisee restaurants (primarily certain units in Canada which we now operate). In 2005, the increase in China Division Company sales was driven by new unit development, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines driven by the mainland China supplier ingredient issue and consumer concerns related to Avian Flu. In 2004, the increase in China Division Company sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth. In 2005, the increase in China Division franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines driven by the mainland China supplier ingredient issue and consumer concerns related to Avian Flu. In 2004, the increase in China Division franchise and license fees was primarily driven by new unit development. 38 Company Restaurant Margins 2005 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Company sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Food and paper 29.8 33.1 36.2 31.4 Payroll and employee benefits 30.2 24.1 13.3 26.4 Occupancy and other operating expenses 26.2 30.7 33.1 28.2 Company restaurant margin 13.8 % 12.1 % 17.4 % 14.0 % 2004 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Company sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Food and paper 29.9 33.8 37.1 31.8 Payroll and employee benefits 30.5 23.8 11.5 26.4 Occupancy and other operating expenses 25.8 29.4 31.1 27.3 Company restaurant margin 13.8 % 13.0 % 20.3 % 14.5 % 2003 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Company sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Food and paper 28.8 34.1 38.0 30.9 Payroll and employee benefits 31.0 23.8 10.7 27.2 Occupancy and other operating expenses 25.6 29.1 31.5 27.1 Company restaurant margin 14.6 % 13.0 % 19.8 % 14.8 % In 2005, U.S. restaurant margins as a percentage of sales were flat compared to 2004. The impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by higher occupancy and other costs. Higher occupancy and other costs were driven by increases in utility costs and advertising costs. A favorable impact from the 53rd week (13 basis points) was offset by the unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R (17 basis points). In 2004, the decrease in U.S. restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by higher food and paper costs and higher occupancy and other costs, partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. Higher food and paper costs were primarily driven by increased commodity costs (principally cheese and meats) and higher occupancy and other costs were primarily driven by increased expense resulting from the adjustment related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements. In 2005, the decrease in the International Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales included a 51 basis point unfavorable impact of refranchising our restaurants in Puerto Rico. Also contributing to the decrease were higher occupancy and other costs and higher labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. The unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R (10 basis points) was largely offset by the favorable impact of the 53rd week (8 basis points). In 2004, International Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales were flat compared to 2003. The favorable impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by a 68 basis point unfavorable impact of operating certain restaurants in Canada, which is a market with below average margins, that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate. In 2005, China Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales decreased. The decrease was driven by the impact on 39 restaurant margin of same store sales declines related to the mainland China supplier ingredient issue and consumer concerns related to Avian Flu and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation. Also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by the impact on restaurant margin of lower food and paper costs (principally due to supply chain savings initiatives). In 2004, the increase in China Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of lower food and paper costs (principally due to supply chain savings initiatives) and same store sales growth on restaurant margin. The increase was partially offset by higher labor costs and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation. Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $102 million or 10% in 2005, including a 4% unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, a 1% unfavorable impact from the 53rd week and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of these factors, general and administrative expenses increased $38 million or 4%. The increase was driven by higher compensation related costs, including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets and higher litigation related costs including charges of $16 million for the potential resolution of certain legal matters. Higher charitable contributions and expense associated with discontinuing certain corporate software development projects also contributed to the increase. Such increases were partially offset by reductions associated with operating restaurants which were refranchised in 2004 (primarily the Puerto Rico business) and the effect of lapping certain prior year reserve increases related to potential development sites and surplus facilities. General and administrative expenses increased $111 million or 12% in 2004, including a 2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by higher compensation related costs, including incentive compensation, amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets and pension costs. Also contributing to the increase were higher professional fees and increased reserves related to potential development sites and surplus facilities. The increase was also partially attributable to expenses of $11 million associated with operating the restaurants we now own in Canada that were previously operated by our unconsolidated affiliate. These increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses due to the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants. Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses increased $7 million or 24% in 2005. The increase was driven by higher franchisee support costs and higher provisions for doubtful franchise and license fee receivables. Franchise and license expenses decreased $2 million or 8% in 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of lapping the biennial International franchise convention held in 2003. Worldwide Other (Income) Expense 2005 2004 2003 Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ (51 ) $ (54 ) $ (39 ) Gain upon sale of investment in unconsolidated affiliate (11 ) Recovery from supplier (20 ) Foreign exchange net (gain) loss 2 (1 ) (2 ) Other (income) expense $ (80 ) $ (55 ) $ (41 ) 40 Other income increased $25 million or 44% in 2005, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by a $24 million partial financial recovery ($4 million of which was recognized through equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates) from a supplier related to an ingredient issue in mainland China (see Note 7). Other income was also positively impacted in 2005 by a $11 million gain associated with the sale of our investment in our Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate. Other income increased $14 million or 34% in 2004, including a 7% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates, principally in China, and the dissolution of our unconsolidated affiliate in Canada which recorded a loss for the year ended December 27, 2003. Worldwide Facility Actions We recorded a net loss from facility actions of $19 million, $26 million and $36 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See the Store Portfolio Strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and Note 4 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment. Operating Profit % Increase/(Decrease) 2005 2004 2005 2004 United States $ 760 $ 777 (2 ) (4 ) International Division 372 337 11 21 China Division 211 205 3 27 Unallocated and corporate expenses (246 ) (204 ) (21 ) (14 ) Unallocated other income (expense) 9 (2 ) NM NM Unallocated facility actions 43 12 NM NM Wrench litigation income (expense) 2 14 NM NM AmeriServe and other (charges) credits 2 16 NM NM Operating profit $ 1,153 $ 1,155 9 Unallocated and corporate expenses comprise general and administrative expenses and unallocated facility actions comprise refranchising gains (losses), neither of which are allocated to the U.S., International Division, or China Division segments for performance reporting purposes. Unallocated other income (expense) in 2005 primarily comprises the $11 million gain on the sale of our investment in our Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate which we did not allocate to the International Division for performance reporting purposes. U.S. operating profit decreased $17 million or 2% in 2005. The decrease was driven by higher facility actions expense and higher general and administrative expense. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees. The impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit was partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs. A 3% unfavorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R was offset by a 3% favorable impact from the 53rd week. In 2004, the decrease in U.S. operating profit was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of higher commodity costs (primarily cheese and meat) and the adjustment recorded related to our accounting for leases and the depreciation of leasehold improvements, as well as higher general and administrative expenses. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees. International Division operating profit increased $35 million or 11% in 2005, including a 4% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, a 2% favorable impact from the 53rd week, and a 4% unfavorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R. Excluding the net favorable impact from these factors, International Division operating profit increased $31 million or 9% in 2005. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and 41 franchise and license fees, the impact of new unit development on franchise and license fees and restaurant profit, and lower facility actions expense. These increases were partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs, higher labor costs and the impact on operating profit of refranchising our restaurants in Puerto Rico. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, International Division operating profit increased 12% in 2004. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees, new unit development and higher income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by higher general and administrative costs. China Division operating profit increased $6 million or 3% in 2005. The increase was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of new unit development and a financial recovery from a supplier. These increases were partially offset by the impact on restaurant profit of same store sales declines, a decrease in equity income from unconsolidated affiliates, and increased general and administrative expense. A 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation was offset by a 2% unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R. In 2004, the increase in China Division operating profit was driven by new unit development, the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and higher income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by higher general and administrative costs. Interest Expense, Net 2005 2004 2003 Interest expense $ 147 $ 145 $ 185 Interest income (20 ) (16 ) (12 ) Interest expense, net $ 127 $ 129 $ 173 Interest expense increased $2 million or 2% in 2005. An increase in our average interest rates was largely offset by a decrease in our bank fees attributable to the upgrade in our credit rating. Interest expense decreased $40 million or 22% in 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our average interest rates primarily attributable to pay variable interest rate swaps entered into during 2004. Also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in our average debt outstanding primarily as a result of the amended YGR sale leaseback agreement and lower International short term borrowings. Income Taxes 2005 2004 2003 Reported Income taxes $ 264 $ 286 $ 268 Effective tax rate 25.8 % 27.9 % 30.2 % 42 The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2005 2004 2003 U.S. federal statutory rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 1.6 1.3 1.8 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (6.7) (6.3) (3.6) Adjustments to reserves and prior years (1.3) (6.7) (1.7) Repatriation of foreign earnings 2.0 0.5 Non recurring foreign tax credit adjustment (2.9) (4.1) Valuation allowance additions (reversals) (1.4) 4.2 2.8 Other, net (0.5) (0.1) Effective income tax rate 25.8% 27.9% 30.2% Income taxes and the effective tax rate as shown above reflect tax on all amounts included in our results of operations except for the income tax benefit of approximately $1 million on the $2 million cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the year ended December 27, 2003 due to the adoption of SFAS 143. The 2005 effective tax rate decreased 2.1 percentage points to 25.8%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors, including the impact of year over year valuation allowances adjustments as well as the recognition of certain foreign tax credits that we were able to substantiate in 2005. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of year over year adjustments to reserves and prior years and tax provided on foreign earnings which were repatriated to the U.S. in 2005. The 2004 effective tax rate decreased 2.3 percentage points to 27.9%. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a number of factors, including the reversal of reserves in the current year associated with audits that were settled as well as the effects of certain international tax planning strategies implemented in 2004. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of lapping the benefit in 2003 of amending certain prior U.S. income tax returns to claim credit for foreign taxes paid in prior years as well as the recognition in 2004 of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization is no longer considered more likely than not. Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, that we believe may impact our exposure. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,238 million compared to $1,186 million in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in net income, including the non cash impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and lower income tax payments in 2005, partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R. In 2004, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,186 million compared to $1,099 million in 2003. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net income and a decrease in the amount of voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan compared to 2003, partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2004. Net cash used in investing activities was $345 million versus $541 million in 2004. The decrease was driven primarily by lower acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and capital spending, the impact of the timing of purchases and sales 43 of short term investments, higher proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment versus 2004 and the proceeds from the sale of our Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate. In 2004, net cash used in investing activities was $541 million versus $565 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily driven by higher proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and lower capital spending compared to 2003, partially offset by the impact of the timing of purchases and sales of shortterm investments. Net cash used in financing activities was $832 million versus $779 million in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by higher share repurchases, partially offset by net debt borrowings in 2005 versus net debt repayments in 2004 and the impact of excess tax benefits classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R. In 2004, net cash used in financing activities was $779 million versus $475 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily driven by higher share repurchases, higher net debt repayments and the payment of two quarterly dividends, partially offset by higher proceeds from stock option exercises. 44 Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last four fiscal years, net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion. These cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending, while at the same time reducing our long term debt balances. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations, we believe our operating cash flows, our ability to reduce discretionary spending, and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2006 and beyond. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid cash dividends of $123 million. Additionally, on November 18, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.115 per share of common stock to be distributed on February 3, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 13, 2006. On an annual basis, the Company is targeting an annual payout ratio of 15% to 20% of net income. Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) which matures in September 2009. The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, level of cash dividends, aggregate non U.S. investment and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2005. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2005, our unused Credit Facility totaled $809 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $191 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2005. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.35% to 1.625% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or 0.00% to 0.20% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. Additionally, on November 8, 2005, we executed a five year revolving credit facility (the International Credit Facility or ICF) on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries. The total facility amount is $350 million, with separate sublimits for each of the three subsidiaries. The ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM and by YUMs principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 31, 2005. There were borrowings of $180 million and available credit of $170 million outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2005. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.20% to 1.20% over LIBOR or 0.00% to 0.20% over a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branchs publicly announced reference rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUMs performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly. The remainder of our long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $1.5 billion at December 31, 2005. Included in short term borrowings at December 31, 2005 are $200 million in Senior Unsecured Notes with an April 2006 maturity date. The remaining $1.3 billion in Senior Unsecured Notes comprise the majority of our long term debt. We estimate that in 2006 capital spending, including acquisitions of our restaurants from franchisees, will be approximately $675 million. We also estimate that in 2006 refranchising proceeds, prior to taxes, will be approximately 45 $150 million, employee stock options proceeds, prior to taxes, will be approximately $150 million and sales of property, plant and equipment will be approximately $50 million. In November 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of the Companys outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) to be purchased through November 2006. At December 31, 2005, we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to $469 million of our outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under the November program. In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 31, 2005 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt(a) $ 1,757 $ 202 $ 254 $ 186 $ 1,115 Capital leases(b) 163 16 29 27 91 Operating leases(b) 2,680 362 612 488 1,218 Purchase obligations(c) 171 123 34 8 6 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP 17 7 4 6 Total contractual obligations $ 4,788 $ 703 $ 936 $ 713 $ 2,436 (a) Excludes a fair value adjustment of $6 million deducted from debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 11. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to approximately 5,500 restaurants. See Note 12. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. The pension plans funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets. Based on current funding rules, we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2006, but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plans expected September 30, 2006 funded status. During 2005, we made a $65 million discretionary contribution to our funded plan, none of which represented minimum funding requirements. Our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made postretirement benefit payments of $4 million in 2005. Also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) as well as employee healthcare and long term disability claims for which we are self insured. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health, long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. 46 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had provided approximately $16 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the Companys historical refranchising programs and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants at December 31, 2005. In support of these guarantees, we posted letters of credit of $4 million. We also provided a standby letter of credit of $18 million, under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately $77 million at December 31, 2005. Any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss (gain). New loans added to the loan pools in 2005 were not significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value). Our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant, which can be for a period of over 20 years, and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is our cost of capital, adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist. We often refranchise restaurants in groups and, therefore, perform such impairment evaluations at the group level. Forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs. Expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary. In addition, we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to our semi 47 annual test for impairment of our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants. The fair values of our investments in each of our unconsolidated affiliates are currently significantly in excess of their carrying values. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value. We have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions. These include trademark/brand intangible assets for KFC, LJS and A&W. We believe the value of a trademark/brand is derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or receive, in the case of franchise stores, due to our ownership of the trademark/brand. We have determined that the KFC trademark/brand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized. Our impairment test for the KFC trademark/brand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. Anticipated sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the KFC trademark/brand. In determining the fair value of our reporting units and the KFC trademark/brand, we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth, margin and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans. For 2005, there was no impairment of goodwill or the KFC trademark/brand. We have certain intangible assets, such as the LJS and A&W trademark/brand intangible assets, franchise contract rights and favorable operating leases, which are amortized over their expected useful lives. We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept. We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate. We base the expected useful lives of our favorable operating leases on the remaining lease term. Our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the assets future remaining life. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets. Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/Lease Guarantees We reserve a franchisees or licensees entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 31, 2005. We have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants. Such guarantees are subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections (SFAS 145). We recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under SFAS 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable. The fair 48 value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties. If payment on the guarantee ever becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees. At December 31, 2005, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with $316 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 31, 2005. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. See Note 21 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees. Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 21 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans was amended in 2001 such that employees hired after September 30, 2001 are not eligible to participate. As of our September 30, 2005 measurement date, these plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $815 million, an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) of $736 million and a fair value of plan assets of $610 million. As a result of the $126 million underfunded status of the plans relative to the ABO at September 30, 2005 and an additional $10 million contribution to the plans made subsequent to the measurement date but prior to December 31, 2005, we have recorded a cumulative $110 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss (net of tax of $66 million) as of December 31, 2005. The PBO and ABO reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees. The PBO incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the ABO reflects only current compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBO and ABO are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. We measured our PBO and ABO using a discount rate of 5.75% at September 30, 2005. This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary. The basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more high quality corporate debt instruments with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the benefit cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year. The weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our PBO by approximately $69 million at September 30, 2005. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our PBO by approximately $77 million at September 30, 2005. 49 The pension expense we will record in 2006 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at September 30, 2005. In total, we expect pension expense to increase approximately $10 million to $66 million in 2006. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial loss of $8 million in 2006. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption of 5.75% at September 30, 2005 would impact our 2006 pension expense by approximately $13 million. The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rate of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our estimated long term rate of return on plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions. Our expected long term rate of return was lowered to 8.0% from 8.5% in connection with our September 30, 2005 valuation. We believe this revision was appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon, including those experienced in calendar year 2005. This change did not impact our reported pension expense for 2005 but will increase our 2006 expense by approximately $3 million. The losses our plan assets have experienced, along with the decrease in discount rates, have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of $256 million in our plans as of September 30, 2005. For purposes of determining 2005 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $22 million of unrecognized actuarial loss. We will recognize approximately $30 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2006. Given no change to the assumptions at our September 30, 2005 measurement date, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2006 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline. See Note 14 for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans. Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves At December 31, 2005, we have a valuation allowance of $233 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $223 million and our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. The estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 19 for a further discussion of our income taxes. Stock Option Expense Compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 15. Additionally, under SFAS 123R we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that it was appropriate to group our stock option grants into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected life and pre vesting forfeitures. These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the RGM 50 Plan) and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans. Historically, approximately 20% of total options granted have been made under the RGM Plan. We have traditionally used six years as the expected term of all stock option grants. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R and the increasing amount of historical data we now possess with regard to stock option exercise activity, we revaluated our expected term assumptions. Based on historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior, we determined that the expected life for options granted under the RGM Plan was five years. For options granted to our above store executives, we determined that an expected life of six years was appropriate. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R we have traditionally based expected volatility on Company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option. We are in the process of revaluating expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options. Options granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R in the fourth quarter of 2005 were not significant. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R we recorded reductions in expense due to pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data. Based on such data, we believe that approximately 45% of all options granted under the RGM Plan, which typically vest on a cliff basis after four years, will be forfeited while approximately 19% of options granted to above store executives, which typically vest 25% per year over four years, will be forfeited. An insignificant transition adjustment was recorded upon the adoption of SFAS 123R for the difference between actual and estimated forfeitures for the first three quarters of 2005 which we restated under the modified retrospective transition method. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $7 million and $6 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 would decrease approximately $39 million and $51 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 would decrease approximately $59 million and $76 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The combined International Division and China Division operating profits constitute approximately 43% of our operating profit in 2005, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2005. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Changes in foreign 51 currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, operating profit would have decreased $70 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a limited basis, commodity future and option contracts. Commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, did not significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cautionary Statements From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements, we present forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
