Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview Description of Business YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM or the Company) is the worlds largest restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with over 34,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries and territories operating under the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers or A&W All American Food Restaurants brands. Four of the Companys restaurant brands KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silvers are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza, Mexican style food and quick service seafood categories, respectively. Of the over 34,000 restaurants, 22% are operated by the Company, 72% are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 6% are operated by licensees. YUMs business consists of three reporting segments: United States, the International Division and the China Division. The China Division includes mainland China, Thailand and KFC Taiwan and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. The China and International Divisions have been experiencing dramatic growth and now represent approximately half of the Companys operating profits. The U.S. business operates in a highly competitive marketplace resulting in slower profit growth, but continues to produce strong cash flows. Strategies The Company continues to focus on four key strategies: Build Dominant China Brands The Company has developed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants, respectively, in mainland China. Additionally, the Company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland China which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage. Given this strong competitive position, a rapidly growing economy and a population of 1.3 billion in mainland China, the Company is rapidly adding KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of Pizza Hut Home Service (pizza delivery) and East Dawning (Chinese food). Drive Profitable International Division Expansion The Company and its franchisees opened over 700 new restaurants in 2006 in the Companys International Division, representing seven straight years of opening over 700 restaurants. The International Division generated over $400 million in operating profit in 2006 up from $186 million in 1998. The Company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including India, France and Russia. Improve U.S. Brands Positions and Returns The Company continues to focus on improving its U.S. position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience. The Company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts. We are the leader in multibranding, with over 3,000 restaurants providing customers two or more of our brands at a single location. We continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on Company owned restaurants. Drive High Return on Invested Capital & Strong Shareholder Payout The Company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. The Company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry. Additionally, 2006 was the second consecutive year in which the Company returned over $1.1 billion to its shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. The Company recently announced that it was doubling its quarterly dividend rate for the second quarter, 2007 dividend payment, and now expects to generate an approximate 2% dividend yield. 2006 Highlights Worldwide system sales grew by 5% excluding the benefit of the 53rd week in 2005 Diluted earnings per share increased 14% 25 Company restaurant margins increased 1.2 percentage points world wide and grew in all three reporting segments China Division operating profit up a strong 37% Mainland China restaurant growth of 18% International Division operating profit up 11% excluding the benefit of the 53rd week in 2005 International Division opened 785 new restaurants U.S. Division grew operating profit 3% excluding the benefit of the 53rd week in 2005 U.S. operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 13.6% Throughout the Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), the Company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of currency translation. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We also provide the percentage change excluding the extra week certain of our businesses had in fiscal 2005. We believe the elimination of the currency translation impact and the 53rd week impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations or an extra week in fiscal 2005. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 56 through 59 and the Cautionary Statements on page 52. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 60 through 101. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results The following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004 and could impact comparability with our results in 2007. Extra Week in 2005 Our fiscal calendar results in a 53rd week every five or six years. Fiscal year 2005 included a 53rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our U.S. businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period, as opposed to a monthly, basis. In the U.S., we permanently accelerated the timing of the KFC business closing by one week in December 2005, and thus, there was no 53rd week benefit for this business. Additionally, all China Division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53rd week. 26 The following table summarizes the estimated increase (decrease) of the 53rd week on fiscal year 2005 revenues and operating profit: U.S. International Division Unallocated Total Revenues Company sales $ 58 $ 27 $ $ 85 Franchise and license fees 8 3 11 Total Revenues $ 66 $ 30 $ $ 96 Operating profit Franchise and license fees $ 8 $ 3 $ $ 11 Restaurant profit 14 5 19 General and administrative expenses (2 ) (3 ) (3 ) (8 ) Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates 1 1 Operating profit $ 20 $ 6 $ (3 ) $ 23 Mainland China Recovery Our KFC business in mainland China was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late March 2005 as well as consumer concerns related to Avian Flu in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result of the aforementioned issues, the China Division experienced system sales growth in 2005 of 11% excluding currency translation which is below our ongoing target of at least 22%. During the year ended December 30, 2006, the China Division recovered from these issues and achieved growth rates of 23% for both system sales and Company sales, both excluding currency translation. During 2005, we entered into agreements with the supplier of the aforementioned ingredient. As a result, we recognized recoveries of approximately $24 million in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005. United States Restaurant Profit Restaurant profits in the U.S. were positively impacted by a decline of approximately $45 million in commodity costs (principally meats and cheese) for the year ended 2006 versus the year ended 2005. We expect commodity inflation in the U.S. of 2% to 3% in 2007. Our U.S. restaurant profits were also positively impacted by lower self insured property and casualty insurance expenses of $31 million for the year ended 2006 versus 2005. These lower insurance expenses were the result of improved loss trends, which we believe are driven by safety and other measures we have implemented over time, on our insurance reserves and lower property related losses (including the lapping of the unfavorable impact of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and a small, related insurance recovery in 2006). While we anticipate that these favorable loss trends will continue, it is difficult to forecast their impact, including the impact of large property and casualty losses that may occur. However, we anticipate that given the significant favorability in 2006, property and casualty insurance expense in 2007 will be flat to slightly higher in comparison. Taco Bell Northeast United States Produce Sourcing Issue Our Taco Bell business was negatively impacted by adverse publicity related to a produce sourcing issue during November and December 2006. As a result, Taco Bell experienced significant sales declines at both company and franchise stores, particularly in the northeast United States where an outbreak of illness associated with a particular strain of E. coli 0157:H7 took place. According to the Centers for Disease Control this outbreak was associated with eating at Taco Bell restaurants in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Delaware. In the fourth quarter of 2006, Taco Bells company same store sales were down 5%, driven largely by a very significant negative sales impact during the month of December. Overall, we estimate this issue negatively impacted operating profit by $20 million in the fourth quarter of 27 2006 due primarily to lost Company sales and franchise and license fees as well as incremental marketing costs. Same store sales at Taco Bell have begun to recover from their lowest point in the third week of December. While we anticipate that Taco Bell will fully recover from this issue by the middle of 2007, our experience has been that recoveries of this type vary in duration and could take longer. The timing of such recovery will determine the impact on 2007 operating profit. We currently forecast same store sales growth at Taco Bell in 2007 of one to two percent. U.S. Beverage Agreement Contract Termination During the first quarter of 2006, we entered into an agreement with a beverage supplier to certain of our Concepts to terminate a long term supply contract. As a result of the cash payment we made to the supplier in connection with this termination, we recorded a pre tax charge of $8 million to Other (income) expense in the quarter ended March 25, 2006. The affected Concepts have entered into an agreement with an alternative beverage supplier. The contract termination charge we recorded in the quarter ended March 25, 2006 was partly offset by more favorable beverage pricing for our Concepts in 2006. We expect to continue to benefit from the more favorable pricing in 2007 and beyond. Pizza Hut United Kingdom Acquisition On September 12, 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom (U.K.) unconsolidated affiliate from our partner, paying approximately $178 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of $9 million of cash assumed. Additionally, we assumed the full liability, as opposed to our fifty percent share, associated with the Pizza Hut U.K.s capital leases of $95 million and short term borrowings of $23 million. This unconsolidated affiliate operated more than 500 restaurants in the U.K. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Thus, we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate (after interest expense and income taxes) as Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded franchise fee income from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate. From the date of the acquisition through December 4, 2006 (the end of the fiscal year for Pizza Hut U.K.), we reported Company sales and the associated restaurant costs, general and administrative expense, interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statement of Income. We no longer recorded franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate nor did we report other income under the equity method of accounting. As a result of this acquisition, company sales and restaurant profit increased $164 million and $16 million, respectively, franchise fees decreased $7 million and general and administrative expenses increased $8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant. Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment In the fourth quarter 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R requires all new, modified and unvested share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights, be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straight line basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified retrospective application transition method effective September 4, 2005, the beginning of our 2005 fourth quarter. As permitted by SFAS 123R, we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption (our fiscal year 2005). As such, the results for the first three quarters of 2005 were required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of SFAS 123. However, years prior to 2005 have not been restated. As shown below, the adoption of SFAS 123R resulted in a decrease in net income of $38 million and a reduction of basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.13 for 2005. Additionally, cash flows from operating activities decreased $87 million in 2005 and cash flows from financing activities increased $87 million in 2005. The impact of applying SFAS 123R on the results of operations and cash flows for 2006 was similar to the impact on 2005. 28 2005 U.S. International China Unallocated Total Payroll and employee benefits $ 8 $ 2 $ $ $ 10 General and administrative 14 11 4 19 48 Operating profit $ 22 $ 13 $ 4 $ 19 58 Income tax benefit (20) Net income impact $ 38 Basic earnings per share $ 0.13 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.13 Prior to 2005, all stock options granted were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and its related Interpretations. Accordingly, no stock based employee compensation expense was reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for stock options, as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Had the Company applied the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 to stock options in 2004, net income of $740 million would have been reduced by $37 million to $703 million. Additionally, both basic and diluted earnings per common share would have decreased $0.12 per share for 2004. Sale of an Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate During the second quarter of 2005, we sold our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all KFCs and Pizza Huts in Poland and the Czech Republic to our then partner in the entity, principally for cash. Concurrent with the sale, our former partner completed an initial public offering (IPO) of the majority of the stock it then owned in the entity. Prior to the sale, we accounted for our investment in this entity using the equity method. Subsequent to the IPO, the new publicly held entity, in which YUM has no ownership interest, is a franchisee as was the entity in which we previously held a fifty percent interest. In 2005, this transaction generated a gain of approximately $11 million for YUM as cash proceeds (net of expenses) of approximately $25 million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate. As with our equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the gain of approximately $11 million was recorded in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Income. The sale did not have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in 2005 or 2006. Sale of Puerto Rico Business Our Puerto Rico business was held for sale beginning the fourth quarter of 2002 and was sold on October 4, 2004 for an amount approximating its then carrying value. As a result of this sale, company sales and restaurant profit decreased $159 million and $29 million, respectively, franchise fees increased $10 million and general and administrative expenses decreased $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 25, 2004. Lease Accounting Adjustments In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease, including options in some instances, over which we were recording rent expense, including escalations, on a straight line basis. The cumulative adjustment, primarily through increased U.S. depreciation expense, totaled $11.5 million ($7 million after tax). The portion of this adjustment that related to 2004 was approximately $3 million. As the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to 29 any of those prior period financial statements, the entire adjustment was recorded in the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements. Wrench Litigation We recorded income of $2 million and $14 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. There was no impact from Wrench Litigation in 2006. See Note 4 for a discussion of the Wrench litigation. AmeriServe and Other Charges (Credits) We recorded income of $1 million, $2 million and $16 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 4 for a detailed discussion of AmeriServe and other charges (credits). Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of strategic U.S. and international markets. In the U.S., we are in the process of decreasing our Company ownership of restaurants from its current level of 23% to approximately 17%. This three year plan calls for selling approximately 1,500 Company restaurants to franchisees from 2006 through 2008. In 2006, 452 company restaurants in the U.S. were sold to franchisees. In the International Division, we expect to refranchise approximately 300 Pizza Huts in the United Kingdom over the next several years reducing our Pizza Hut Company ownership in that market from approximately 80% currently to approximately 40%. Refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. The following table summarizes our refranchising activities: 2006 2005 2004 Number of units refranchised 622 382 317 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 257 $ 145 $ 140 Refranchising net gains, pre tax $ 24 $ 43 $ 12 In addition to our refranchising program, from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing, we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit (collectively store closures). Store closure costs (income) includes the net of gains or losses on sales of real estate on which we are not currently operating a Company restaurant, lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves, and other facility related expenses from previously closed stores. The following table summarizes Company store closure activities: 2006 2005 2004 Number of units closed 214 246 319 Store closure costs (income) $ (1 ) $ $ (3 ) The impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and Company store closures is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and general and administrative expenses and (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit. 30 The following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising and Company store closures: 2006 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (377 ) $ (136 ) $ (22 ) $ (535 ) Increased franchise fees 14 6 20 Decrease in total revenues $ (363 ) $ (130 ) $ (22 ) $ (515 ) 2005 U.S. International Division ChinaDivision Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (240 ) $ (263 ) $ (15 ) $ (518 ) Increased franchise fees 8 13 21 Decrease in total revenues $ (232 ) $ (250 ) $ (15 ) $ (497 ) The following table summarizes the estimated impact on operating profit of refranchising and Company store closures: 2006 U.S. International Division ChinaDivision Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (38 ) $ (5 ) $ $ (43 ) Increased franchise fees 14 6 20 Decreased general and administrative expenses 1 1 2 Increase (decrease) in operating profit $ (23 ) $ 2 $ $ (21 ) 2005 U.S. International Division ChinaDivision Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (22 ) $ (34 ) $ (1 ) $ (57 ) Increased franchise fees 8 13 21 Decreased general and administrative expenses 1 10 11 Increase (decrease) in operating profit $ (13 ) $ (11 ) $ (1 ) $ (25 ) 31 Results of Operations 2006 % B/(W) vs. 2005 2005 % B/(W) vs. 2004 Company sales $ 8,365 2 $ 8,225 3 Franchise and license fees 1,196 7 1,124 10 Total revenues $ 9,561 2 $ 9,349 4 Company restaurant profit $ 1,271 10 $ 1,155 % of Company sales 15.2% 1.2 ppts. 14.0% (0.5 ) ppts.

These units will be presented as franchisee new builds as the co branding into Rostiks/KFC restaurants occurs. Balances at the end of 2004 for the worldwide and China unit activity have been adjusted to include December 2004 activity in mainland China due to the change in its reporting calendar. The net change was an addition of 16, 2, 1 and 19 units for company, unconsolidated affiliates, franchisees and total, respectively. 32 United States Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees Balance at end of 2004 4,989 13,482 18,471 New Builds 125 240 365 Acquisitions Refranchising (244 ) 242 (2 ) Closures (174 ) (364 ) (538 ) Other (10 ) 5 (5 ) Balance at end of 2005 4,686 13,605 18,291 New Builds 99 235 334 Acquisitions Refranchising (452 ) 455 3 Closures (124 ) (368 ) (492 ) Other 3 (22 ) (19 ) Balance at end of 2006 4,212 13,905 18,117 % of Total 23% 77% 100% The above total excludes 1,944 and 2,181 licensed units at the end of 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Included in the above totals are multibrand restaurants. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. Franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units. Multibrand restaurant totals were as follows: 2006 Company Franchise Total United States 1,802 1,631 3,433 International Division 11 192 203 Worldwide 1,813 1,823 3,636 2005 Company Franchise Total United States 1,696 1,400 3,096 International Division 17 176 193 Worldwide 1,713 1,576 3,289 For 2006 and 2005, Company multibrand unit gross additions were 212 and 373, respectively. For 2006 and 2005, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 197 and 171, respectively. There are no multibrand units in the China Division. 34 System Sales Growth Increase Increase excluding currency translation Increase excluding currency translation and 53rd week 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 United States 5% N/A N/A 1% 4% International Division 7% 9% 7% 6% 9% 5% China Division 26% 13% 23% 11% 23% 11% Worldwide 4% 7% 4% 6% 5% 5% System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. The explanations that follow for system sales growth consider year over year changes excluding the impact of currency translation and the 53rd week. The increases in worldwide system sales in 2006 and 2005 were driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. The increase in U.S. system sales in 2006 was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. The increase in U.S. system sales in 2005 was driven by same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. The increases in International Division system sales in 2006 and 2005 were driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. The increase in China Division system sales in 2006 was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. The increase in China Division system sales in 2005 was driven by new unit development, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines. 35 Revenues Amount % Increase (Decrease) % Increase(Decrease)excluding currencytranslation % Increase (Decrease) excludingcurrency translationand 53rd week 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005 Company sales United States $ 4,952 $ 5,294 (6 ) 3 N/A N/A (5) 1 International Division 1,826 1,676 9 (4 ) 8 (8 ) 10 (10) China Division 1,587 1,255 26 16 23 14 23 14 Worldwide 8,365 8,225 2 3 1 2 2 1 Franchise and license fees United States 651 635 3 6 N/A N/A 4 5 International Division 494 448 10 17 10 15 11 14 China Division 51 41 25 8 21 7 21 7 Worldwide 1,196 1,124 7 10 6 9 8 8 Total revenues United States 5,603 5,929 (5 ) 3 N/A N/A (4) 2 International Division 2,320 2,124 9 9 (4 ) 10 (5) China Division 1,638 1,296 26 16 23 14 23 14 Worldwide $ 9,561 $ 9,349 2 4 2 3 3 2 The explanations that follow for revenue fluctuations consider year over year changes excluding the impact of currency translation and the 53rd week. Excluding the favorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, worldwide Company sales were flat in 2006. Increases from new unit development and same store sales growth were offset by decreases in refranchising and store closures. In 2005, the increase in worldwide Company sales was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. In 2006 and 2005, the increase in worldwide franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and refranchising, partially offset by store closures. In 2006, franchise and license fees were also negatively impacted by the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition. In 2006, the decrease in U.S. Company sales was driven by refranchising and store closures, partially offset by new unit development. In 2005, the increase in U.S. Company sales was driven by same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by refranchising and store closures. In 2006, blended U.S. Company same store sales were flat as a decrease in transactions was offset by an increase in average guest check. In 2005, blended U.S. Company same store sales increased 4% due to increases in average guest check and transactions. U.S. blended same store sales includes KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Company owned restaurants only. U.S. same store sales for Long John Silvers and A&W restaurants are not included. In 2006, the increase in U.S. franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, refranchising and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. In 2005, the increase in U.S. franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, same store sale growth and refranchising, partially offset by store closures. 36 Excluding the favorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, International Division Company sales were flat in 2006. The impacts of refranchising and store closures were partially offset by new unit development and same store sales growth. In 2005, the decrease in International Division Company sales was driven by refranchising (primarily our Puerto Rico business) and store closures, partially offset by new unit development. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, International Division franchise and licenses fees increased 13% in 2006. The increase was driven by new unit development and same store growth, partially offset by store closures. In 2005, the increase in International Division franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, refranchising (primarily our Puerto Rico business) and royalty rate increases. In 2006, the increase in China Division Company sales and franchise and licenses fees was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth. In 2005, the increase in China Division Company sales and franchise and licenses fees was driven by new unit development, partially offset by the impact of same store sales declines.

These increases were partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs, higher labor costs, primarily driven by wage rates and benefits, and the lapping of the favorable impact of the 53rd week in 2005. The higher occupancy and other costs were driven by increased advertising and higher utility costs. In 2005, U.S. restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was flat compared to 2004. The impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin was offset by higher occupancy and other costs. Higher occupancy and other costs were 37 driven by increases in utility costs and advertising costs. A favorable impact from the 53rd week (13 basis points) was offset by the unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R (17 basis points). In 2006, the increase in International Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin as well as the favorable impact of refranchising and closing certain restaurants. These increases were offset by higher labor costs and higher food and paper costs. In 2005, the decrease in the International Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales included a 51 basis point unfavorable impact of refranchising our restaurants in Puerto Rico. Also contributing to the decrease were higher occupancy and other costs and higher labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. The unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R (10 basis points) was largely offset by the favorable impact of the 53rd week (8 basis points). In 2006, the increase in China Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. The increase was partially offset by the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operations. In 2005, China Division restaurant margins as a percentage of sales decreased. The decrease was driven by the impact on restaurant margin of same store sales declines and lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation. Also contributing to the decrease was higher labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by lower food and paper costs (principally due to supply chain savings initiatives). Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $29 million or 2% in 2006, including a 1% favorable impact from lapping the 53rd week in 2005. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation related costs, including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets, as well as G&A expenses for our Pizza Hut U.K. business which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent interest of the business in 2006. These increases were partially offset by lapping higher prior year litigation related costs. G&A expenses increased $102 million or 10% in 2005, including a 4% unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, a 1% unfavorable impact from the 53rd week and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact of these factors, general and administrative expenses increased $38 million or 4%. The increase was driven by higher compensation related costs, including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets, and higher litigation related costs including charges of $16 million for the potential resolution of certain legal matters. Higher charitable contributions and expense associated with discontinuing certain corporate software development projects also contributed to the increase. Such increases were partially offset by reductions associated with operating restaurants which were refranchised in 2004 (primarily the Puerto Rico business) and the effect of lapping certain prior year reserve increases related to potential development sites and surplus facilities. 38 Worldwide Other (Income) Expense 2006 2005 2004 Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ (51 ) $ (51 ) $ (54 ) Gain upon sale of investment in unconsolidated affiliate(a) (2 ) (11 ) Recovery from supplier(b) (20 ) Foreign exchange net (gain) loss and other (6 ) 2 (1 ) Contract termination charge(c) 8 Other (income) expense $ (51 ) $ (80 ) $ (55 ) (a) Reflects gains related to the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all KFCs and Pizza Huts in Poland and the Czech Republic to our then partner in the entity.

Neither unallocated and corporate expenses, which comprise G&A expenses, nor unallocated refranchising gain (loss) are allocated to the U.S., International Division, or China Division segments for performance reporting purposes. The decrease in corporate and unallocated expenses in 2006 was driven by the lapping of the unfavorable impact of 2005 litigation related costs. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005, U.S. operating profit increased $23 million or 3% in 2006. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales on restaurant profit (due to higher average guest check) 39 and franchise and license fees, new unit development and lower closures and impairment expenses. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of refranchising, higher G&A expenses and a charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in 2006. The impact of lower commodity costs and lower property and casualty insurance expense on restaurant profit was largely offset by higher other restaurant costs, including labor, advertising and utilities. U.S. operating profit decreased $17 million or 2% in 2005. The decrease was driven by higher closures and impairment expenses and higher G&A expenses. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees. The impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit was partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs. A 3% unfavorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R was offset by a 3% favorable impact from the 53rd week. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005, International Division operating profit increased $41 million or 11% in 2006. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on franchise and license fees and restaurant profit. These increases were partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and lower equity income from unconsolidated affiliates. Currency translation did not have a significant impact. International Division operating profit increased $35 million or 11% in 2005, including a 4% favorable impact from currency translation, a 2% favorable impact from the 53rd week, and a 4% unfavorable impact from the adoption of SFAS 123R. Excluding the net favorable impact from these factors, International Division operating profit increased $31 million or 9% in 2005. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees, the impact of new unit development on franchise and license fees and restaurant profit, and lower closures and impairment expenses. These increases were partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs, higher labor costs and the impact on operating profit of refranchising our restaurants in Puerto Rico. China Division operating profit increased $79 million or 37% in 2006 including a 4% favorable impact from currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit, new unit development and an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates. These increases were partially offset by higher G&A expenses and the lapping of a prior year financial recovery from a supplier. China Division operating profit increased $6 million or 3% in 2005. The increase was driven by the impact on restaurant profit of new unit development and a financial recovery from a supplier. These increases were partially offset by the impact on restaurant profit of same store sales declines, a decrease in equity income from unconsolidated affiliates, and increased general and administrative expense. A 2% favorable impact from currency translation was offset by a 2% unfavorable impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Interest Expense, Net 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense $ 172 $ 147 $ 145 Interest income (18 ) (20 ) (16 ) Interest expense, net $ 154 $ 127 $ 129 Interest expense increased $25 million or 17% in 2006. The increase was driven by both an increase in interest rates on the variable rate portion of our debt and increased borrowings as compared to prior year. Interest expense increased $2 million or 2% in 2005. An increase in our average interest rates was largely offset by a decrease in our bank fees attributable to an upgrade in our credit rating. 40 Income Taxes 2006 2005 2004 Reported Income taxes $ 284 $ 264 $ 286 Effective tax rate 25.6 % 25.8 % 27.9 % The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2006 2005 2004 U.S. federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 2.0 1.6 1.3 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (7.8 ) (8.4 ) (7.8 ) Adjustments to reserves and prior years (3.5 ) (1.1 ) (6.7 ) Repatriation of foreign earnings (0.4 ) 2.0 0.5 Non recurring foreign tax credit adjustment (6.2 ) (1.7 ) Valuation allowance additions (reversals) 6.8 (1.1 ) 5.7 Other, net (0.3 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Effective income tax rate 25.6 % 25.8 % 27.9 % Our 2006 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular U.S. audit cycle as well as certain out of year adjustments to reserves and accruals that lowered our effective income tax rate by 2.2 percentage points. The reversal of tax reserves was partially offset by valuation allowance additions on foreign tax credits for which, as a result of the tax reserve reversals, we currently believe we are not likely to utilize before they expire. We also recognized deferred tax assets for the foreign tax credit impact of non recurring decisions to repatriate certain foreign earnings in 2007. However, we provided full valuation allowances on such assets as we do not believe it is currently more likely than not that they will be realized. We recognized the benefit of certain recurring foreign tax credits in amounts similar to prior years in 2006. Our 2005 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals for certain deferred tax assets whose realization became more likely than not as well as the recognition of certain nonrecurring foreign tax credits we were able to substantiate in 2005. The impact of these items was partially offset by tax expense associated with our 2005 decision to repatriate approximately $390 million in qualified foreign earnings. These earnings, as well as $110 million for which a determination was made to repatriate in 2004, were eligible for a dividends received deduction in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Our 2004 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular U.S. audit cycle, partially offset by the recognition of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets whose realization was no longer considered more likely than not. Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure. 41 Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,302 million compared to $1,238 million in 2005. The increase was driven by a higher net income, lower pension contributions and a 2006 partial receipt of the settlement related to the 2005 mainland China supplier ingredient issue. These factors were offset by higher income tax and interest payments in 2006. In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,238 million compared to $1,186 million in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in net income, including the non cash impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and lower income tax payments in 2005, partially offset by the impact of excess tax benefits from share based compensation classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Net cash used in investing activities was $476 million versus $345 million in 2005. The increase was driven by the current year acquisitions of the remaining interest in our Pizza Hut U.K. unconsolidated affiliate and the Rostiks brand and associated intellectual properties in Russia. The lapping of proceeds related to the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in our former Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from refranchising in 2006. In 2005, net cash used in investing activities was $345 million versus $541 million in 2004. The decrease was primarily driven by lower acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees and capital spending, higher proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment versus 2004 and the proceeds from the sale of our fifty percent interest in our former Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate. Net cash used in financing activities was $673 million versus $832 million in 2005. The decrease was driven by an increase in net borrowings and lower share repurchases, partially offset by a reduction in the excess tax benefits from share based compensation and higher dividend payments. In 2005, net cash used in financing activities was $832 million versus $779 million in 2004. The increase was driven primarily by higher share repurchases, partially offset by net debt borrowings in 2005 versus net debt repayments in 2004 and the impact of excess tax benefits from share based compensation classified in financing activities in 2005 pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last five fiscal years, net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized. However, we believe our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity would allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2007 and beyond. Discretionary Spending During 2006, we invested $614 million in our businesses, including approximately $331 million in the U.S., $118 million for the International Division and $165 million for the China Division. We also acquired the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom unconsolidated affiliate for $178 million in cash. For the second straight year, we returned over $1.1 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. Under the authority of our Board of Directors, we repurchased 20.2 million shares of our Common Shares for $983 million during 2006. In September 2006, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of up to $500 million of the Companys outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) to be purchased through September 42 2007. At December 30, 2006, we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to $469 million of our outstanding common stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under the September 2006 authorization. During the year ended December 30, 2006, we paid cash dividends of $144 million. Additionally, on November 17, 2006 and December 5, 2006, our Board of Directors approved cash dividends of $0.15 and $0.30, respectively, per share of common stock to be distributed on February 2, 2007 and March 30, 2007, respectively, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 12, 2007 and March 9, 2007, respectively. For 2007, we estimate that capital spending will be approximately $650 million. We also estimate that refranchising proceeds, prior to taxes, will total approximately $200 million in 2007. We also expect to provide returns to our shareholders through both significant share repurchases and dividends. We are targeting a 3% to 4% reduction of our diluted share count in 2007. Borrowing Capacity Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) which matures in September 2009. The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, level of cash dividends, aggregate non U.S. investment and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 30, 2006. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit. At December 30, 2006, our unused Credit Facility totaled $778 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $222 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 30, 2006. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.35% to 1.625% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or 0.00% to 0.20% over an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. In November 2005, we executed a five year revolving credit facility totaling $350 million (the International Credit Facility or ICF) on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries. The ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM and by YUMs principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at the end of 2006. There were borrowings of $174 million and available credit of $176 million outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2006. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.20% to 1.20% over LIBOR or 0.00% to 0.20% over a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branchs publicly announced reference rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUMs performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly. In 2006, we executed two short term borrowing arrangements (the Term Loans) on behalf of the International Division. There were borrowings of $183 million outstanding at the end of 2006 under the Term Loans, both of which expired and were repaid in the first quarter of 2007. The majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes with varying maturity dates from 2008 through 2016 and interest rates ranging from 6.25% to 8.88%. The Senior Unsecured Notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $1.6 billion at December 30, 2006. This amount 43 includes $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes that were issued in April 2006 due April 15, 2016. We used $200 million of these proceeds to repay our 8.5% Senior Unsecured Notes that matured in April 2006 and the remainder for general corporate purposes. Contractual Obligations In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, our significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 30, 2006 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt obligations(a) $ 2,744 $ 360 $ 506 $ 1,021 $ 857 Capital leases(b) 303 20 40 38 205 Operating leases(b) 3,606 438 757 618 1,793 Purchase obligations(c) 265 198 47 6 14 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP 13 5 3 5 Total contractual obligations $ 6,931 $ 1,016 $ 1,355 $ 1,686 $ 2,874 (a) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments. Rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on an estimate of future interest rates. Excludes a fair value adjustment of $13 million deducted from debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 12. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to approximately 5,800 restaurants. See Note 13. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our most significant plan, the Yum Retirement Plan (the U.S. Plan), is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain full time U.S. salaried employees. Our funding policy with respect to the U.S. Plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the U.S. Plans funded status. The U.S. Plans funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of U.S. Plan assets. Based on current funding rules, we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2007, but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the U.S. Plans expected September 30, 2007 funded status. During 2006, we made a $23 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. Plan, none of which represented minimum funding requirements. At our September 30, 2006 measurement date, our pension plans in the U.S., which include the U.S. Plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan, had a projected benefit obligation of $864 million and plan assets of $673 million. The funding rules for our pension plans outside of the U.S. vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates, performance of plan assets, local laws and tax regulations. Our most significant plans are in the U.K., including a plan for which we assumed full liability upon our purchase of the remaining fifty percent interest in our former Pizza Hut U.K. unconsolidated affiliate. During 2006, we made a discretionary contribution of approximately $18 million to our KFC U.K. pension plan in anticipation of certain future funding requirements. Since our plan assets approximate our projected benefit obligation at year end for this plan, we do not anticipate any significant further, near term funding. The projected benefit obligation of our Pizza Hut U.K. pension plan exceeds plan assets by approximately $35 million. We anticipate taking steps to reduce this deficit in the near term, which could include a decision to partially 44 or completely fund the deficit in 2007. However, given the level of cash flows from operations the Company anticipates generating in 2007, any funding decision would not materially impact our ability to maintain our planned levels of discretionary spending. During 2006, Congress passed the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Act") with the stated purpose of improving the funding of Americas private pension plans. The Act introduces new funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, introduces benefit limitations for certain under funded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions. The Act applies to pension plan years beginning after December 31, 2007 and is applicable only to our U.S. Plan. We have preliminarily reviewed the provisions of the Act to determine the impact on the Company. Required funding under the Act will be dependent upon many factors including our U.S. Plans future funded status as well as discretionary contributions we may choose to make. Based upon this preliminary review as well as the current funded status of the U.S. Plan relative to our level of annual operating cash flows, we do not believe that required contributions under the Act would materially impact our operating cash flows in any one given year. Our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made postretirement benefit payments of $4 million in 2006. See Note 15 for further details about our pension and post retirement plans. We have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for: workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) for which we are self insured; employee healthcare and long term disability claims for which we are self insured; and income taxes and associated interest we may pay upon audit by tax authorities of tax returns previously filed. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health, long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. We provide reserves for potential tax and associated interest exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a substainable position on a matter contrary to our position. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had provided approximately $16 million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the Companys historical refranchising programs and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants at December 30, 2006. In support of these guarantees, we posted letters of credit of $4 million. We also provided a standby letter of credit of $18 million, under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools. The total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately $75 million at December 30, 2006. Any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss (gain). New loans added to the loan pools in 2006 were not significant. Our unconsolidated affiliates have approximately $29 million of short term debt outstanding as of December 30, 2006, none of which is guaranteed by YUM. Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Fourth Quarter of 2006 In the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify a current year misstatement using an approach that considers both the impact of prior year misstatements that remain on the balance sheet and those that were recorded in the current year income statement. Historically, we quantified prior year misstatements and assessed materiality based on a current year income statement approach. The transition provisions of SAB 108 permitted the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect of uncorrected prior year misstatements that were not material to any prior periods under our historical income statement approach but that were material under the guidance in 45 SAB 108 through retained earnings at the beginning of 2006. See Note 2 for further discussion on the impact of adopting SAB 108. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 required the Company to recognize the funded status of its pension and post retirement plans in the December 30, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise in future years will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income to the extent they have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 has been included in the Companys December 30, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Notes 2 and 15 for further discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS 158. SFAS 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of pension and postretirement plans as of the date of a Companys fiscal year end effective in the year ended 2008. Certain of our plans currently have measurement dates that do not coincide with our fiscal year end and thus we will be required to change their measurement dates in 2008. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, the year beginning December 31, 2006 for the Company. FIN 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption, the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 48, if any, shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We do not currently anticipate that the adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings we will record upon adoption of FIN 48 will materially impact our financial condition. FIN 48 also requires that subsequent to initial adoption a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition, derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period (including any related interest and penalties) be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs. Currently, we record such changes in judgment, including audit settlements, as a component of our annual effective rate. Thus, our reported quarterly income tax rate may become more volatile upon adoption of FIN 48. This change will not impact the manner in which we record income tax expense on an annual basis. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measures (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, the year beginning December 30, 2007 for the Company. We are currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS 157 to determine any impact for the Company. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, the year beginning December 30, 2007 for the Company. We are currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS 159 to determine any impact for the Company. 46 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value). Our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant, which can be for a period of over 20 years, and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate. We often refranchise restaurants in groups and, therefore, perform such impairment evaluations at the group level. Forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs. Expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the fair value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary. In addition, we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. The fair values of our investments in each of our unconsolidated affiliates are currently significantly in excess of their carrying values. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value. The discount rate used in determining fair value is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate. 47 We have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions. These include trademark/brand intangible assets for KFC, LJS and A&W. We believe the value of a trademark/brand is derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or receive, in the case of franchise stores, due to our ownership of the trademark/brand. We have determined that the KFC trademark/brand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized. Our impairment test for the KFC trademark/brand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. Future sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the KFC trademark/brand. In determining the fair value of our reporting units and the KFC trademark/brand, we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth, margin and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans. For 2006, there was no impairment of goodwill or the KFC trademark/brand. We have certain intangible assets, such as the LJS and A&W trademark/brand intangible assets, franchise contract rights, reacquired franchise rights and favorable operating leases, which are amortized over their expected useful lives. We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept. We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate. We base the expected useful lives of reacquired franchise rights over a period for which we believe it is reasonable that we will operate a Company restaurant in the trade area. We base the expected useful lives of our favorable operating leases on the remaining lease term. Our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the assets future remaining life. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets. Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/Lease Guarantees We reserve a franchisees or licensees entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 30, 2006. We have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants. Such guarantees are subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections (SFAS 145). We recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under SFAS 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable. The fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties. If payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees. At December 30, 2006, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with $336 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 30, 2006. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts. 48 See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. See Note 22 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees. Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 22 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans are in the U.S. In accordance with our fourth quarter 2006 adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS 158, we have recorded the under funded status of $191 million for these U.S. plans as a pension liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2006. These U.S. plans had projected benefit obligations (PBO) of $864 million and fair values of plan assets of $673 million. The PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. For our U.S. plans, we measured our PBO using a discount rate of 5.95% at September 30, 2006. This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary. The primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more high quality corporate debt instruments with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year. The weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $71 million at our measurement dates. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $77 million at our measurement dates. The pension expense we will record in 2007 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement dates. We expect pension expense for our U.S. plans to decrease approximately $7 million to $59 million in 2007. The decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial loss of $6 million in 2007. A 50 basis point change in our weighted average discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2007 U.S. pension expense by approximately $13 million. The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our estimated long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions. Our expected long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets at September 30, 2006 was 8.0%. We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our 2007 U.S. pension plan expense by approximately $6 million. 49 The losses our U.S. plan assets have experienced, along with a decrease in discount rates over time, have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of $216 million in the U.S. plans. For purposes of determining 2006 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $30 million of previously unrecognized actuarial loss. We will recognize approximately $24 million of unrecognized actuarial loss in 2007. Given no change to our current assumptions, actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in 2007 over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline. See Note 15 for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Expense Compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated on the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 16. Additionally, under SFAS 123R we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions. In connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R, we determined that it was appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures. These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the RGM Plan) and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans. Historically, approximately 20% of total options granted have been made under the RGM Plan. Grants under the RGM Plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25% per year over four years. We use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by SFAS 123R. We revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis. Based on the results of this analysis, we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 we have traditionally based expected volatility on Company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option. Subsequent to adoption, we revaluated expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options. Based on this analysis, our weighted average volatility used in the determination of fair value for 2006 grants was 31%. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 we recorded reductions in expense due to pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data. Based on such data, we believe that approximately 45% of all awards granted under the RGM Plan will be forfeited and approximately 20% of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited. Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves At December 30, 2006, we have a valuation allowance of $342 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefit of $331 million, as well our other deferred tax assets, to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. 50 As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 20 for a further discussion of our income taxes and Note 22 for further discussion of certain proposed Internal Revenue Service adjustments. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the United States. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $8 million and $7 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 would decrease approximately $32 million and $39 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 would decrease approximately $69 million and $59 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The combined International Division and China Division operating profits constitute approximately 48% of our operating profit in 2006, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1.4 billion as of December 30, 2006. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006, operating profit would have decreased $78 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. 51 We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as, on a limited basis, commodity future and option contracts. Commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, did not significantly impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cautionary Statements From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements, we present forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The statements include those identified by such words as may, will, expect, project, anticipate, believe, plan and other similar terminology. These forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements. Actual results involve risks and uncertainties, including both those specific to the Company and those specific to the industry, and could differ materially from expectations. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Company risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in effective tax rates; potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities; our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores; unexpected disruptions in our supply chain; effects and outcomes of any pending or future legal claims involving the Company; the effectiveness of operating initiatives and marketing and advertising and promotional efforts; our ability to continue to recruit and motivate qualified restaurant personnel; the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees; the success of our refranchising strategy; the success of our strategies for international development and operations; volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates; and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies. Industry risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate, including effects of war and terrorist activities; new legislation and governmental regulations or changes in laws and regulations and the consequent impact on our business; new product and concept development by us and or our food industry competitors; changes in commodity, labor, and other operating costs; changes in competition in the food industry; publicity which may impact our business and or industry; severe weather conditions; volatility of commodity costs; increases in minimum wage and other operating costs; availability and cost of land and construction; consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the products of the Company and or our competitors, spending patterns and demographic trends; political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates; and the impact that any widespread illness or general health concern may have on our business and or the economy of the countries in which we operate. 52
