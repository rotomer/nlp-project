Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 52 through 55 (Financial Statements) and the Cautionary Statements on pages 47 through 48. Throughout the MD&A, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM or the Company) makes reference to certain performance measures as described below. The Company provides the percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We also provide the percentage changes excluding the extra week that certain of our businesses had in fiscal year 2005. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation and the 53rd week impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations or an extra week in fiscal year 2005. System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. Worldwide same store sales is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. Company same store sales include only KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell Company owned restaurants that have been open one year or more. U.S. same store sales for Long John Silvers and A&W restaurants are not included given the relative insignificance of the Company stores for these brands and the limited impact they currently have, and will have in the future, on our U.S. same store sales as well as our overall U.S. performance. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company restaurants in generating Company sales divided by Company sales. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements on pages 56 through 101. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. All per share and share amounts herein, and in the accompanying Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the June 26, 2007 stock split (see Note 3). Description of Business YUM is the worlds largest restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with over 35,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries and territories operating under the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers or A&W All American Food Restaurants brands. Four of the Companys restaurant brands KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silvers are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza, Mexican style food and quick service seafood categories, respectively. Of the over 35,000 restaurants, 22% are operated by the Company, 72% are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 6% are operated by licensees. YUMs business consists of three reporting segments: United States, the International Division and the China Division. The China Division includes mainland China, Thailand and KFC Taiwan and the International Division includes the remainder of our international operations. The China and International Divisions have been experiencing dramatic growth and now represent over half of the Companys operating profits. The U.S. business operates in a highly competitive marketplace resulting in slower profit growth, but continues to produce strong cash flows. 21 Strategies The Company continues to focus on four key strategies: Build Leading Brands in China in Every Significant Category The Company has developed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants, respectively, in mainland China. Additionally, the Company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland China which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage. Given this strong competitive position, a rapidly growing economy and a population of 1.3 billion in mainland China, the Company is rapidly adding KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of Pizza Hut Home Service (pizza delivery) and East Dawning (Chinese food). Our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual system sales growth of 20% in mainland China driven by at least 425 new restaurants each year, which we expect to drive annual operating profit growth of 20% in the China Division. Drive Aggressive International Expansion and Build Strong Brands Everywhere The Company and its franchisees opened over 850 new restaurants in 2007 in the Companys International Division, representing 8 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants. The International Division generated $480 million in operating profit in 2007 up from $186 million in 1998. The Company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including India, France, Russia, Vietnam and Africa. Our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual operating profit growth of 10% driven by 750 new restaurant openings annually for the International Division. New unit development is expected to contribute to system sales growth of at least 5% (3% to 4% unit growth and 2% to 3% same store sales growth) each year. Dramatically Improve U.S. Brand Positions, Consistency and Returns The Company continues to focus on improving its U.S. position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience. The Company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts. We are the leader in multibranding, with nearly 3,700 restaurants providing customers two or more of our brands at a single location. We continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on Company owned restaurants. Our ongoing earnings growth model calls for annual operating profit growth of 5% in the U.S. with same store sales growth of 2% to 3% and leverage of our General and Administrative (G&A) infrastructure. Drive Industry Leading, Long Term Shareholder and Franchisee Value The Company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. The Company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry. Additionally, 2007 was the third consecutive year in which the Company returned over $1.1 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The Company is targeting an annual dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40% of net income. 2007 Highlights Diluted earnings per share of $1.68 or 15% growth. Worldwide system sales growth of 8% driven by new unit growth in mainland China and the International Division. Worldwide same store sales growth of 3% and operating profit growth of 8%. Double digit operating profit growth of 30% from the China Division and 18% from the International Division, offsetting a 3% decline in the U.S. Effective tax rate of 23.7%. Payout to shareholders of $1.7 billion through share repurchases and dividends, with repurchases helping to reduce our diluted share count by a net 4%. 22 Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results The following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and could impact comparability with our results in 2008. Mainland China Commodity Inflation China Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales declined to 20.1% during 2007 from 20.4% in 2006. This decline was driven by rising chicken costs in mainland China, which make up approximately 40% of mainland Chinas cost of food and paper, and higher restaurant labor costs in mainland China. Rising chicken costs are resulting from both lower than expected availability and increased demand in the market. The increased costs were partially offset in 2007 by strong same store sales growth, including the impact of menu pricing increases. In mainland China, we expect that high commodity inflation (including higher chicken costs) will continue into the first half of 2008 and moderate later in the year. U.S. Restaurant Profit Our resulting U.S. restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 1.3 percentage points in 2007 and increased 0.8 percentage points in 2006. Our U.S. restaurant profit was impacted in 2007 and 2006 by several key events and trends. These include the negative impact on the Taco Bell business of adverse publicity related to a produce sourcing issue in the fourth quarter of 2006 and an infestation issue in one franchise store in February 2007, fluctuations in commodity costs, and lower self insured property and casualty insurance reserves. Taco Bell experienced significant sales declines at both Company and franchise stores in the fourth quarter 2006 and for almost all of 2007, particularly in the northeast U.S. where both issues originated. For the full year 2007, Taco Bells Company same store sales were down 5%. Taco Bells Company same store sales were flat in the fourth quarter of 2007 and we believe that Taco Bell will fully recover from these issues. However, our experience has been that recoveries of this type vary in duration. In 2007, we experienced significant increases in commodity costs resulting in approximately $44 million of commodity inflation. This inflation was primarily driven by meats and cheese products. We expect these unfavorable commodity trends to continue in 2008 resulting in commodity inflation of approximately 5% for the full year, with the majority of this impact seen in the first half of the year. In 2006, restaurant profits were positively impacted versus 2005 by a decline in commodity costs, principally meats and cheese, of approximately $45 million. The sizeable February 2008 beef recall in the U.S. had no impact on our results though the impact, if any, on beef prices going forward is not yet known. Self insurance property and casualty insurance expenses were down $27 million versus the prior year in both 2007 and 2006, exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchising stores. The favorability in insurance expenses was the result of improved loss trends, which we believe are primarily driven by safety and claims handling procedures we implemented over time, as well as workers compensation reforms at the state level. We anticipate that given the significant favorability in 2007, property and casualty expense in 2008 will be significantly higher in comparison. The increased expenses are currently expected to be most impactful to our second quarter of 2008. 23 Pizza Hut United Kingdom Acquisition On September 12, 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom (U.K.) unconsolidated affiliate from our partner, paying approximately $178 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of $9 million of cash assumed. Additionally, we assumed the full liability, as opposed to our fifty percent share, associated with the Pizza Hut U.K.s capital leases of $97 million and short term borrowings of $23 million. This unconsolidated affiliate operated more than 500 restaurants in the U.K. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Thus, we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate (after interest expense and income taxes) as Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate. Since the date of the acquisition, we have reported Company sales and the associated restaurant costs, G&A expense, interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statement of Income. We no longer record franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate, nor do we report other income under the equity method of accounting. As a result of this acquisition, Company sales and restaurant profit increased $576 million and $59 million, respectively, franchise fees decreased $19 million and G&A expenses increased $33 million in the year ended December 29, 2007 compared to the year ended December 30, 2006. As a result of this acquisition, Company sales and restaurant profit increased $164 million and $16 million, respectively, franchise fees decreased $7 million and G&A expenses increased $8 million in the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant in either year. Extra Week in 2005 Our fiscal calendar results in a 53rd week every five or six years. Fiscal year 2005 included a 53rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our U.S. businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period, as opposed to a monthly, basis. In the U.S., we permanently accelerated the timing of the KFC business closing by one week in December 2005, and thus, there was no 53rd week benefit for this business. Additionally, all China Division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53rd week. The following table summarizes the estimated increase (decrease) of the 53rd week on fiscal year 2005 revenues and operating profit: U.S. International Division Unallocated Total Revenues Company sales $ 58 $ 27 $ $ 85 Franchise and license fees 8 3 11 Total Revenues $ 66 $ 30 $ $ 96 Operating profit Franchise and license fees $ 8 $ 3 $ $ 11 Restaurant profit 14 5 19 General and administrative expenses (2 ) (3 ) (3 ) (8 ) Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates 1 1 Operating profit $ 20 $ 6 $ (3 ) $ 23 24 Mainland China 2005 Business Issues Our KFC business in mainland China was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late March 2005 as well as consumer concerns related to Avian Flu in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result of the aforementioned issues, the China Division experienced system sales growth in 2005 of 11%, excluding foreign currency translation which was below our ongoing target of at least 22%. During the year ended December 30, 2006, the China Division recovered from these issues and achieved growth rates of 23% for both system sales and Company sales, both excluding foreign currency translation. During 2005, we entered into agreements with the supplier of the aforementioned ingredient. As a result, we recognized recoveries of approximately $24 million in Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005. Significant 2008 Gains and Charges In 2008, we expect that our results of operations will be significantly impacted by several events, including the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan and refranchising gains and charges related to our U.S. business. In December 2007, we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan for $128 million in cash (includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in December 2007). Our international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close. Thus, consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period, the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of approximately $87 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2008. We also anticipate pre tax gains from refranchising in the U.S. of $20 million to $50 million in 2008. We expect, that together these gains will be partially offset by charges relating to G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, as well as investments in our U.S. brands to drive stronger growth. The net impact of all of the aforementioned gains and charges is expected to generate approximately $50 million in operating profit in 2008. While we will no longer have an ownership interest in the entity that operates both KFCs and Pizza Huts in Japan, it will continue to be a franchisee as it was when it operated as an unconsolidated affiliate. Excluding the one time gain, we do not expect that the sale of our interest in our Japan unconsolidated affiliate will have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in 2008 and beyond as the Other income we recorded representing our share of earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate has historically not been significant ($4 million in 2007). Future Tax Legislation Mainland China On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress in mainland China enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on January 1, 2008. Upon enactment, which occurred in the China Divisions 2007 second fiscal quarter, the deferred tax balances of all Chinese entities, including our unconsolidated affiliates, were adjusted. The impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended December 29, 2007 were not significant. We currently estimate that these income tax rate changes will positively impact our 2008 net income between $10 million and $15 million compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted. Mexico Value Added Tax (VAT) Exemption On October 1, 2007, Mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to VAT payments. Beginning on January 1, 2008, we will be required to remit VAT on all Company restaurant sales resulting in lower Company sales and restaurant profit. As a result of this new legislation, we estimate that our 2008 International Divisions Company sales and restaurant profit will be unfavorably impacted by approximately $38 million and $34 million, respectively. Additionally, the International Divisions system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 0.3% and 1.2 percentage points, respectively. 25 China 2008 Reporting Issues We have historically not consolidated an entity in China in which we have a majority ownership interest, instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting. Our partners in this entity are essentially state owned enterprises. We have not consolidated this entity due to the historical effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business as addressed in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 96 16, "Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights". Concurrent with a decision that we made on January 1, 2008 regarding top management of the entity, we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, we will begin to consolidate this entity in 2008. The change will result in higher Company sales, restaurant profit, G&A expenses and Income tax provision, as well as lower franchise and license fees and Other income. Had this change occurred at the beginning of 2007, our China Divisions Company sales, restaurant profit and G&A expenses would have increased approximately $227 million, $49 million and $5 million, respectively, and our franchise and license fees and Other income would have decreased $14 million and $13 million, respectively. The net impact of these changes and the resulting minority interest would have resulted in Operating profit increasing by $11 million with an offsetting increase in Income tax provision such that Net income would not have been impacted. Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of strategic U.S. and international markets. In the U.S., we are targeting Company ownership of restaurants potentially below 10% by year end 2010, down from its current level of 22%. Consistent with this strategy, 756 Company restaurants in the U.S. were sold to franchisees in 2006 and 2007. In the International Division, we expect to refranchise approximately 300 Pizza Huts in the U.K. over the next several years reducing our Pizza Hut Company ownership in that market from approximately 80% currently to approximately 40%. Refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. Additionally, G&A expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities. The timing of such declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals. G&A expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct G&A that we are no longer incurring as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities: 2007 2006 2005 Number of units refranchised 420 622 382 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 117 $ 257 $ 145 Refranchising net gains, pre tax $ 11 $ 24 $ 43 In addition to our refranchising program, from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing, we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit 26 (collectively store closures). Store closure (income) costs includes the net of gain or loss on sales of real estate on which we formerly operated a Company restaurant that was closed, lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves, and other facility related expenses from previously closed stores. The following table summarizes worldwide Company store closure activities: 2007 2006 2005 Number of units closed 204 214 246 Store closure (income) costs $ (8 ) $ (1 ) $ The impact on operating profit arising from refranchising and Company store closures is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and G&A expenses and (b) the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised. The amounts presented below reflect the estimated historical results from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year. The amounts do not include results from new restaurants that we opened in connection with a relocation of an existing unit or any incremental impact upon consolidation of two or more of our existing units into a single unit. The following table summarizes the estimated historical results of refranchising and Company store closures: 2007 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (449 ) $ (181 ) $ (34 ) $ (664 ) Increased franchise and license fees 20 9 29 Decrease in total revenues $ (429 ) $ (172 ) $ (34 ) $ (635 ) 2006 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (377 ) $ (136 ) $ (22 ) $ (535 ) Increased franchise and license fees 14 6 20 Decrease in total revenues $ (363 ) $ (130 ) $ (22 ) $ (515 ) The following table summarizes the estimated impact on operating profit of refranchising and Company store closures: 2007 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (39 ) $ (7 ) $ (4 ) $ (50 ) Increased franchise and license fees 20 9 29 Decreased general and administrative expenses 7 3 10 Increase (decrease) in operating profit $ (12 ) $ 5 $ (4 ) $ (11 ) 27 2006 U.S. International Division China Division Worldwide Decreased restaurant profit $ (38 ) $ (5 ) $ $ (43 ) Increased franchise and license fees 14 6 20 Decreased general and administrative expenses 1 1 2 Increase (decrease) in operating profit $ (23 ) $ 2 $ $ (21 ) Results of Operations 2007 % B/(W) vs. 2006 2006 % B/(W) vs. 2005 Company sales $ 9,100 9 $ 8,365 2 Franchise and license fees 1,316 10 1,196 7 Total revenues $ 10,416 9 $ 9,561 2 Company restaurant profit $ 1,327 4 $ 1,271 10 % of Company sales 14.6 % (0.6 ) ppts. 15.2 % 1.2 ppts Operating profit 1,357 8 1,262 9 Interest expense, net 166 (8 ) 154 (22 ) Income tax provision 282 1 284 (7 ) Net income $ 909 10 $ 824 8 Diluted earnings per share(a) $ 1.68 15 $ 1.46 14 (a) See Note 4 for the number of shares used in this calculation. 28 Restaurant Unit Activity Worldwide Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees(a)(b) Balance at end of 2005 7,587 1,648 22,666 31,901 New Builds 426 136 953 1,515 Acquisitions 556 (541 ) (15 ) Refranchising (622 ) (1 ) 626 3 Closures (214 ) (33 ) (675 ) (922 ) Other 3 (3 ) (39 ) (39 ) Balance at end of 2006 7,736 1,206 23,516 32,458 New Builds 505 132 1,070 1,707 Acquisitions 9 6 (14 ) 1 Refranchising (420 ) (6 ) 426 Closures (204 ) (24 ) (706 ) (934 ) Other (1 ) 5 4 Balance at end of 2007 7,625 1,314 24,297 33,236 % of Total 23% 4% 73% 100% United States Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees(a) Balance at end of 2005 4,686 13,605 18,291 New Builds 99 235 334 Acquisitions Refranchising (452 ) 455 3 Closures (124 ) (368 ) (492 ) Other 3 (22 ) (19 ) Balance at end of 2006 4,212 13,905 18,117 New Builds 87 262 349 Acquisitions 8 (7 ) 1 Refranchising (304 ) 304 Closures (106 ) (386 ) (492 ) Other (1 ) 3 2 Balance at end of 2007 3,896 14,081 17,977 % of Total 22% 78% 100% 29 International Division Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees(a)(b) Balance at end of 2005 1,375 1,096 8,848 11,319 New Builds 47 35 703 785 Acquisitions 555 (541 ) (14 ) Refranchising (168 ) (1 ) 169 Closures (47 ) (25 ) (303 ) (375 ) Other (3 ) (16 ) (19 ) Balance at end of 2006 1,762 561 9,387 11,710 New Builds 54 18 780 852 Acquisitions 1 6 (7 ) Refranchising (109 ) (6 ) 115 Closures (66 ) (11 ) (314 ) (391 ) Other 2 2 Balance at end of 2007 1,642 568 9,963 12,173 % of Total 13% 5% 82% 100% China Division Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees Balance at end of 2005 1,526 552 213 2,291 New Builds 280 101 15 396 Acquisitions 1 (1 ) Refranchising (2 ) 2 Closures (43 ) (8 ) (4 ) (55 ) Other (1 ) (1 ) Balance at end of 2006 1,762 645 224 2,631 New Builds 364 114 28 506 Acquisitions Refranchising (7 ) 7 Closures (32 ) (13 ) (6 ) (51 ) Other Balance at end of 2007 2,087 746 253 3,086 % of Total 68% 24% 8% 100% (a) The Worldwide, U.S. and International Division totals exclude 2,109, 1,928 and 181 licensed units, respectively, at December 29, 2007. There are no licensed units in the China Division. Licensed units are generally units that offer limited menus and operate in non traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums and amusement parks where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. As licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units, we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information. (b) The Worldwide and International Division totals at the end of 2007 exclude approximately 32 units from the 2006 acquisition of the Rostiks brand in Russia that have not yet been co branded into Rostiks/KFC restaurants. The Rostiks units will be presented as franchisee new builds as the co branding into Rostiks/KFC restaurants occurs. 30 Multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. Franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units. Multibrand restaurant totals were as follows: 2007 Company Franchise Total United States 1,750 1,949 3,699 International Division 6 284 290 (a) Worldwide 1,756 2,233 3,989 2006 Company Franchise Total United States 1,802 1,631 3,433 International Division 11 192 203 Worldwide 1,813 1,823 3,636 (a) Includes 53 Pizza Hut Wing Street units that were not reflected as multibrand units at December 30, 2006. For 2007 and 2006, Company multibrand unit gross additions were 86 and 212, respectively. For 2007 and 2006, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 283 and 197, respectively. There are no multibrand units in the China Division. System Sales Growth Increase Increase excluding foreign currency translation Increase excluding foreign currency translation and 53rd week 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 United States N/A N/A N/A 1% International Division 15% 7% 10% 7% 10% 9% China Division 31% 26% 24% 23% 24% 23% Worldwide 8% 4% 6% 4% 6% 5% The explanations that follow for system sales growth consider year over year changes excluding, where applicable, the impact of foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in fiscal year 2005. The increases in International Division, China Division and Worldwide system sales in 2007 and 2006 were driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. In 2007 U.S. system sales were flat as new unit development was largely offset by store closures. The increase in U.S. system sales in 2006 was driven by new unit development and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. 31 Revenues Amount % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) excluding foreign currency translation % Increase (Decrease) excluding foreign currency translation and 53rd week 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Company sales United States $ 4,518 $ 4,952 (9 ) (6 ) N/A N/A N/A (5) International Division 2,507 1,826 37 9 31 8 31 10 China Division 2,075 1,587 31 26 24 23 24 23 Worldwide 9,100 8,365 9 2 6 1 6 2 Franchise and license fees United States 679 651 4 3 N/A N/A N/A 4 International Division 568 494 15 10 10 10 10 11 China Division 69 51 35 25 29 21 29 21 Worldwide 1,316 1,196 10 7 8 6 8 8 Total revenues United States 5,197 5,603 (7 ) (5 ) N/A N/A N/A (4) International Division 3,075 2,320 33 9 26 9 26 10 China Division 2,144 1,638 31 26 24 23 24 23 Worldwide $ 10,416 $ 9,561 9 2 6 2 6 3 The explanations that follow for revenue fluctuations consider year over year changes excluding, where applicable, the impact of foreign currency translation and the 53rd week in fiscal year 2005. Excluding the favorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, Worldwide Company sales decreased 1% in 2007. The decrease was driven by refranchising and store closures, partially offset by new unit development and same store sales growth. Excluding the favorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, Worldwide Company sales were flat in 2006. Increases from new unit development and same store sales growth were offset by decreases in refranchising and store closures. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, Worldwide franchise and license fees increased 9% and 8% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. These increases were driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and refranchising, partially offset by store closures. In 2007, the decrease in U.S. Company sales was driven by refranchising, same store sales declines and store closures, partially offset by new unit development. In 2006, the decrease in U.S. Company sales was driven by refranchising and store closures, partially offset by new unit development. In 2007, U.S. Company same store sales were down 3% due to transaction declines partially offset by an increase in average guest check. In 2006, U.S. Company same store sales were flat as a decrease in transactions was offset by an increase in average guest check. 32 In 2007, the increase in U.S. franchise and license fees was driven by refranchising and new unit development, partially offset by store closures. In 2006, the increase in U.S. franchise and license fees was driven by new unit development, refranchising and same store sales growth, partially offset by store closures. Excluding the favorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, International Division Company sales decreased 1% in 2007. The decrease was driven by refranchising and store closures, partially offset by same store sales growth and new unit development. Excluding the favorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, International Division Company sales were flat in 2006. The impacts of refranchising and store closures were partially offset by new unit development and same store sales growth. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition, International Division franchise and license fees increased 14% and 13% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases were driven by new unit development and same store sales, partially offset by store closures. 2007 was also favorably impacted by refranchising. In 2007 and 2006, the increases in China Division Company sales and franchise and license fees were driven by new unit development and same store sales growth.

The decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower self insured property and casualty insurance expense driven by improved loss trends, as well as the favorable impact on restaurant margin of refranchising and closing certain restaurants. In 2006, the increase in U.S. restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of lower commodity costs (primarily meats and cheese), the impact of same store sales on restaurant margin (due to higher average guest 33 check) and the favorable impact of lower self insured property and casualty insurance expense. The increase was partially offset by higher occupancy and other costs, higher labor costs, primarily driven by wage rates and benefits, and the lapping of the favorable impact of the 53rd week in 2005. The higher occupancy and other costs were driven by increased advertising and higher utility costs. In 2007, the increase in International Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin as well as the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants. The increase was almost fully offset by higher labor costs (primarily wage rates) and the impact of lower margins associated with Pizza Hut units in the U.K. which we now operate. As a percentage of sales, Pizza Hut U.K. restaurants negatively impacted payroll and employee benefits and occupancy and other expenses and positively impacted food and paper. In 2006, the increase in International Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin as well as the favorable impact of refranchising and closing certain restaurants. These increases were offset by higher labor costs and higher food and paper costs. In 2007, the decrease in China Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by higher commodity costs (primarily chicken products), the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation and higher labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. In 2006, the increase in China Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. The increase was partially offset by the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operations. Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses G&A expenses increased 9% in 2007, including a 2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the additional G&A expenses associated with acquiring the Pizza Hut U.K. business (which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the business) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, G&A expense increased 4%. The increase was driven by higher annual incentive and other compensation costs, including amounts associated with strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets. G&A expenses increased 2% in 2006. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation related costs, including amounts associated with investments in strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets, partially offset by lapping higher prior year litigation related costs. The net impact of the additional G&A expenses associated with acquiring the Pizza Hut U.K. business, the favorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005 and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation was not significant.

Worldwide Closure and Impairment Expenses and Refranchising (Gain) Loss See the Store Portfolio Strategy section for more detail of our refranchising and closure activities and Note 5 for a summary of the components of facility actions by reportable operating segment. Operating Profit % Increase/(Decrease) 2007 2006 2007 2006 United States $ 739 $ 763 (3 ) International Division 480 407 18 9 China Division 375 290 30 37 Unallocated and corporate expenses (257 ) (229 ) 12 (7 ) Unallocated other income (expense) 9 7 NM NM Unallocated refranchising gain (loss) 11 24 NM NM Operating profit $ 1,357 $ 1,262 8 9 United States operating margin 14.2 % 13.6 % 0.6 ppts. 0.8 ppts.

Neither unallocated and corporate expenses, which comprise G&A expenses, nor unallocated refranchising gain (loss) are allocated to the U.S., International Division or China Division segments for performance reporting purposes. The increase in unallocated and corporate expenses in 2007 was driven by an increase in annual incentive compensation and project costs. The decrease in 2006 unallocated and corporate expenses was driven by the lapping of the unfavorable impact of 2005 litigation related costs. U.S. operating profit decreased 3% in 2007. The decrease was driven by higher restaurant operating costs, principally commodities and labor, partially offset by lower G&A expenses, lower closure and impairment expenses and an increase in Other income. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005, U.S. operating profit increased 3% in 2006. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales on restaurant profit (due to higher average guest check) and franchise and license fees, new unit development and lower closures and impairment expenses. These increases were 35 partially offset by the unfavorable impact of refranchising, higher G&A expenses and a charge associated with the termination of a beverage agreement in 2006. The impact of lower commodity costs and lower property and casualty insurance expense on restaurant profit was largely offset by higher other restaurant costs, including labor, advertising and utilities. International Division operating profit increased 18% in 2007 including a 6% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees. The increase was partially offset by higher G&A expenses (including expenses which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the Pizza Hut U.K. business) and higher restaurant operating costs. Excluding the unfavorable impact of lapping the 53rd week in 2005, International Division operating profit increased 11% in 2006. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on franchise and license fees and restaurant profit. These increases were partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and lower equity income from unconsolidated affiliates. Foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact. China Division operating profit increased 30% in 2007 including a 7% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit. The increase was partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and G&A expenses. China Division operating profit increased 37% in 2006 including a 4% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit as well as an increase in equity income from our unconsolidated affiliates. These increases were partially offset by higher G&A expenses and the lapping of a prior year financial recovery from a supplier. Interest Expense, Net 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ 199 $ 172 $ 147 Interest income (33 ) (18 ) (20 ) Interest expense, net $ 166 $ 154 $ 127 Net interest expense increased $12 million or 8% in 2007. The increase was driven by an increase in borrowings in 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by an increase in interest bearing cash equivalents in 2007 compared to 2006. Net interest expense increased $27 million or 21% in 2006. The increase was driven by both an increase in interest rates on the variable rate portion of our debt and increased borrowings as compared to prior year. Income Taxes 2007 2006 2005 Reported Income taxes $ 282 $ 284 $ 264 Effective tax rate 23.7 % 25.6 % 25.8 % 36 The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2007 2006 2005 U.S. federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 1.0 2.0 1.6 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (5.7 ) (7.8 ) (8.4 ) Adjustments to reserves and prior years 2.6 (3.5 ) (1.1 ) Repatriation of foreign earnings (0.4 ) 2.0 Non recurring foreign tax credit adjustments (6.2 ) (1.7 ) Valuation allowance additions (reversals) (9.0 ) 6.8 (1.1 ) Other, net (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (0.5 ) Effective income tax rate 23.7 % 25.6 % 25.8 % Our 2007 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals. In December 2007, the Company finalized various tax planning strategies based on completing a review of our international operations, distributed a $275 million intercompany dividend and sold our interest in our Japan unconsolidated affiliate. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we reversed approximately $82 million of valuation allowances associated with foreign tax credit carryovers that we now believe are more likely than not to be claimed on future tax returns. In 2007, benefits associated with our foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations were negatively impacted by $36 million of expense associated with the $275 million intercompany dividend and approximately $20 million of expense for adjustments to our deferred tax balances as a result of the Mexico tax law change enacted during the fourth quarter of 2007. These negative impacts were partially offset by a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the U.S. Additionally, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the year over year change in adjustments to reserves and prior years. Our 2006 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular U.S. audit cycle as well as certain out of year adjustments to reserves and accruals that lowered our effective income tax rate by 2.2 percentage points. The reversal of tax reserves was partially offset by valuation allowance additions on foreign tax credits for which, as a result of the tax reserve reversals, we believed were not likely to be utilized before they expired. We also recognized deferred tax assets for the foreign tax credit impact of non recurring decisions to repatriate certain foreign earnings in 2007. However, we provided full valuation allowances on such assets as we did not believe it was more likely than not that they would be realized at that time. Our 2005 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals for certain deferred tax assets whose realization became more likely than not as well as the recognition of certain non recurring foreign tax credits we were able to substantiate in 2005. The impact of these items was partially offset by tax expense associated with our 2005 decision to repatriate approximately $390 million in qualified foreign earnings. These earnings were eligible for a dividends received deduction in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves, including interest thereon, established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure. 37 Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,567 million compared to $1,299 million in 2006. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income, lower pension contributions and lower income tax payments in 2007. In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,299 million compared to $1,233 million in 2005. The increase was driven by a higher net income, lower pension contributions and a 2006 partial receipt of the settlement related to the 2005 mainland China supplier ingredient issue. These factors were offset by higher income tax and interest payments in 2006. Net cash used in investing activities was $432 million versus $476 million in 2006. The decrease was driven by the lapping of the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Pizza Hut U.K. unconsolidated affiliate in 2006 and proceeds from the sale of our interest in the Japan unconsolidated affiliate in December 2007, partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and a 2007 increase in capital spending. In December 2007, we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan for $128 million (includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in December 2007). The international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close. Thus, consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period, the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of approximately $87 million will be recorded in the first quarter of 2008. However, the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the U.S. in December 2007 and are thus reported on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 29, 2007. The offset to this cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 29, 2007 is in accounts payable and other current liabilities. In 2006, net cash used in investing activities was $476 million versus $345 million in 2005. The increase was driven by the 2006 acquisitions of the remaining interest in our Pizza Hut U.K. unconsolidated affiliate and the Rostiks brand and associated intellectual properties in Russia. The lapping of proceeds related to the 2005 sale of our fifty percent interest in our former Poland/Czech Republic unconsolidated affiliate also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from refranchising in 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was $678 million versus $670 million in 2006. The increase was driven by higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings. In 2006, net cash used in financing activities was $670 million versus $827 million in 2005. The decrease was driven by an increase in net borrowings and lower share repurchases, partially offset by a reduction in the excess tax benefits from share based compensation and higher dividend payments. Consolidated Financial Condition The increase in short term borrowings at December 29, 2007 was primarily due to the classification of $250 million in Senior Unsecured Notes as short term borrowings due to their May 2008 maturity date, partially offset by the repayment of two term loans in the International Division during the year ended December 29, 2007. The increase in long term debt was primarily due to the 2007 issuance of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes that are due March 15, 2018 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes that are due November 15, 2037. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations, which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last six fiscal years, net cash 38 provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we estimate that refranchising proceeds, prior to income taxes, will total at least $400 million in 2008. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized. However, we believe our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity would allow us to meet our cash requirements in 2008 and beyond. Discretionary Spending During 2007, we invested $742 million in our businesses, including approximately $307 million in the U.S., $189 million for the International Division and $246 million for the China Division. For 2008, we estimate capital spending will be between $700 and $750 million. We returned approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends in 2007. This is the third straight year that we returned over $1.1 billion to our shareholders. Under the authority of our Board of Directors, we repurchased 41.8 million shares of our Common Shares for $1.4 billion during 2007. At December 29, 2007, we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to $813 million of our outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under an October 2007 authorization by our Board of Directors that allowed us to repurchase $1.25 billion of the Companys outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) to be purchased through October 2008. Subsequent to the Companys year end, our Board of Directors authorized additional share repurchases of up to an additional $1.25 billion of the Companys outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) to be purchased through January 2009. In October 2007, the Company announced that we plan to substantially increase the amount of share buybacks over the next two years; buying back a total of up to $4 billion of the Companys outstanding Common Stock, helping to reduce our diluted share count by as much as 20%. Since the announcement of this plan, the Company has repurchased $437 million of our outstanding Common Stock through December 29, 2007. We expect this two year share repurchase program will be funded by a combination of the Companys ongoing free cash flow, additional debt and refranchising proceeds. The completion of this plan will depend on the Companys cash flows, credit rating, proceeds from our refranchising efforts and availability of other investment opportunities, among other factors. During the year ended December 29, 2007, we paid cash dividends of $273 million. Additionally, on November 16, 2007 our Board of Directors approved cash dividends of $0.15 per share of Common Stock to be distributed on February 1, 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 11, 2008. For 2008, we expect to return over $2 billion to shareholders through both cash dividends and significant share repurchases. We are now expecting a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 8% for 2008 and an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35% 40% of net income. Borrowing Capacity On November 29, 2007, the Company executed an amended and restated five year senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the Credit Facility) totaling $1.15 billion which replaced a five year facility in the amount of $1.0 billion that was set to expire on September 7, 2009. The Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at December 29, 2007. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or bankers acceptances, where applicable. At December 29, 2007, our unused Credit Facility totaled $971 million 39 net of outstanding letters of credit of $179 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 29, 2007. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.25% to 1.25% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or is determined by an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. On November 29, 2007, the Company executed an amended and restated five year revolving credit facility (the International Credit Facility or ICF) totaling $350 million, which replaced a five year facility also in the amount of $350 million that was set to expire on November 8, 2010. The ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM and by YUMs principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all debt covenants at the end of 2007. There were borrowings of $28 million and available credit of $322 million outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2007. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.31% to 1.50% over LIBOR or is determined by a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branchs publicly announced reference rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUMs performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly. In 2006, we executed two short term borrowing arrangements (the Term Loans) on behalf of the International Division. There were borrowings of $183 million outstanding at the end of 2006 under the Term Loans, both of which expired and were repaid in the first quarter of 2007. The majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes with varying maturity dates from 2008 through 2037 and interest rates ranging from 6.25% to 8.88%. The Senior Unsecured Notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $2.8 billion at December 29, 2007. This amount includes $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2018 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due November 15, 2037, both of which were issued in October 2007. We are using the proceeds from these notes to repay outstanding borrowings on our Credit Facility, for additional share repurchases and for general corporate purposes. Contractual Obligations In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, our significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 29, 2007 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt obligations(a) $ 5,034 $ 470 $ 375 $ 1,355 $ 2,834 Capital leases(b) 390 24 86 40 240 Operating leases(b) 3,886 462 798 640 1,986 Purchase obligations(c) 414 356 50 5 3 Other long term liabilities reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP 44 15 10 6 13 Total contractual obligations $ 9,768 $ 1,327 $ 1,319 $ 2,046 $ 5,076 40 (a) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments. Rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on an estimate of future interest rates. Excludes a fair value adjustment of $17 million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 13. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to 6,000 restaurants. See Note 14. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements. We have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $319 million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. These liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow. We have included in the contractual obligations table $9 million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in cash in the next year. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our most significant plan, the YUM Retirement Plan (the U.S. Plan), is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain full time U.S. salaried employees. Our funding policy with respect to the U.S. Plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, including requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the U.S. Plans funded status. The U.S. Plans funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of U.S. Plan assets. Based on current funding rules, we do not anticipate being required to make minimum pension funding payments in 2008, but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the U.S. Plans expected December 27, 2008 funded status. During 2007, we did not make a discretionary contribution to the U.S. Plan. At our September 30, 2007 measurement date, our pension plans in the U.S., which include the U.S. Plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan, had a projected benefit obligation of $842 million and plan assets of $732 million. The funding rules for our pension plans outside of the U.S. vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates, performance of plan assets, local laws and tax regulations. Our most significant plans are in the U.K., including a plan for which we assumed full liability upon our purchase of the remaining fifty percent interest in our former Pizza Hut U.K. unconsolidated affiliate. Since our plan assets approximate our projected benefit obligation for our KFC U.K. pension plan, we did not make a significant contribution in 2007 and we do not anticipate any significant further, near term funding. The projected benefit obligation of our Pizza Hut U.K. pension plan exceeds plan assets by approximately $27 million at our November 30, 2007 measurement date. We anticipate taking steps to reduce this deficit in the near term, which could include a decision to partially or completely fund the deficit in 2008. However, given the level of cash flows from operations the Company anticipates generating in 2008, any funding decision would not materially impact our ability to maintain our planned levels of discretionary spending. Our postretirement plan in the U.S. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made postretirement benefit payments of $4 million in 2007. See Note 16 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans. We have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured, including workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) and employee healthcare and long term disability claims. 41 The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare, long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had provided a partial guarantee of approximately $12 million of a franchisee loan pool related primarily to the Companys historical refranchising programs and, to a lesser extent, franchisee development of new restaurants at December 29, 2007. In support of this guarantee, we have provided a standby letter of credit of $18 million, under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of the franchisee loan pool. The total loans outstanding under the loan pool were approximately $62 million at December 29, 2007. The loan pool is funded by the issuance of commercial paper by a conduit established for that purpose. A disruption in the commercial paper markets may result in the Company and the participating financial institutions having to fund commercial paper issuances that have matured. Any Company funding under its guarantee or letter of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral. We believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities. These provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising (gain) loss. New loans added to the loan pool in 2007 were not significant. Our unconsolidated affiliates do not have significant amounts of debt outstanding as of December 29, 2007. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Impairment evaluations for individual restaurants that we are currently operating and have not offered for sale are performed on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant). Our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant, which can be for a period of over 20 years, and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted after tax cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate. We often refranchise restaurants in groups and, therefore, perform such impairment evaluations at the group level. These impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale. Forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds. Expected sales proceeds 42 are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using either discounted expected future cash flows from operations or the present value of the estimated future franchise royalty stream plus any estimated sales proceeds from refranchising. Any estimated sales proceeds are based on relevant historical sales multiples. The discount rate used in determining fair value is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate. We have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions. These include trademark/brand intangible assets for KFC, LJS and A&W. We believe the value of a trademark/brand is derived from the royalty we avoid, in the case of Company stores, or receive, in the case of franchise stores, due to our ownership of the trademark/brand. We have determined that the KFC trademark/brand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized. Our impairment test for the KFC trademark/brand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. Future sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the KFC trademark/brand. In determining the fair value of our reporting units and the KFC trademark/brand, we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth, margin improvement and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans. For 2007, there was no impairment of goodwill or the KFC trademark/brand. We have certain intangible assets, such as the LJS and A&W trademark/brand intangible assets, franchise contract rights, reacquired franchise rights and favorable/unfavorable operating leases, which are amortized over their expected useful lives. We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept. We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate. We base the expected useful lives of reacquired franchise rights over a period for which we believe it is reasonable that we will operate a Company restaurant in the trade area. We base the expected useful lives of our favorable/unfavorable operating leases on the remaining lease term. Our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the assets future remaining life. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets. Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/Lease Guarantees We reserve a franchisees or licensees entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 29, 2007. 43 We have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants. Such guarantees are subject to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections (SFAS 145). We recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under SFAS 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable. The fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties. If payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees. At December 29, 2007, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with approximately $325 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 29, 2007. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. See Note 22 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees. Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 22 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans are in the U.S. In accordance with SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158), we have recorded the under funded status of $110 million for these U.S. plans as a pension liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2007. These U.S. plans had projected benefit obligations (PBO) of $842 million and fair values of plan assets of $732 million in December 29, 2007. The PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. For our U.S. plans, we measured our PBO using a discount rate of 6.50% at September 30, 2007. This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary. The primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated Aa or higher by Moodys with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year. The weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as 44 necessary. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $65 million at our measurement date. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $71 million at our measurement dates. The pension expense we will record in 2008 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date. We expect pension expense for our U.S. plans to decrease approximately $19 million to $37 million in 2008. The decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss of $17 million in 2008. A 50 basis point change in our weighted average discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2008 U.S. pension expense by approximately $10 million. The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our estimated long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions. Our expected long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets at September 30, 2007 was 8.0%. We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our 2008 U.S. pension plan expense by approximately $7 million. The losses our U.S. plan assets have experienced, along with a decrease in discount rates over time, have largely contributed to an unrecognized net loss of $80 million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the U.S. plans at December 29, 2007. For purposes of determining 2007 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $23 million of this loss in net periodic benefit cost. We will recognize approximately $6 million of such loss in 2008. See Note 16 for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Expense Compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated on the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 17. Additionally, under SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Compensation (SFAS 123R) we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions. We have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures. These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the RGM Plan) and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans. Historically, approximately 15% 20% of total options and SARs granted have been made under the RGM Plan. Grants under the RGM Plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25% per year over four years. We use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by SFAS 123R. We revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis. Based on the results of this analysis, we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives. Upon each stock award grant we revaluate the expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options. We have estimated forfeitures based on historical data. Based on such data, we believe that approximately 45% of all awards granted under the RGM Plan will be forfeited and approximately 20% of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited. 45 Income Tax Valuation Allowances and Unrecognized Tax Benefits At December 29, 2007, we had a valuation allowance of $308 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of $363 million, as well as our other deferred tax assets, to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 29, 2007, we had $376 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $194 million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We evaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. See Note 20 for a further discussion of our income taxes. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the U.S. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $3 million and $9 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 would decrease approximately $31 million and $32 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 would decrease approximately $173 million and $69 million, respectively. Fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows. 46 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The combined International Division and China Division operating profits constitute approximately 54% of our operating profit in 2007, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 29, 2007. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007, operating profit would have decreased $89 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors. Cautionary Statements From time to time, in both written reports and oral statements, we present forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The statements include those identified by such words as may, will, expect, project, anticipate, believe, plan and other similar terminology. These forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements. Actual results involve risks and uncertainties, including both those specific to the Company and those specific to the industry, and could differ materially from expectations. Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Company risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in effective tax rates; potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities; our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores; unexpected disruptions in our supply chain; effects and outcomes of any pending or future legal claims involving the Company; the effectiveness of operating initiatives and marketing, advertising and promotional efforts; our ability to continue to recruit and motivate qualified restaurant personnel; the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees; the success of our refranchising strategy; the success of our strategies for international development and operations; volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates; and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies. Industry risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate, including effects of war and terrorist activities; new legislation and governmental regulations or changes in laws and regulations and the consequent impact on our business; new product and concept development by us and or our food industry competitors; changes in competition in the food industry; publicity which may impact our 47 business and or industry; severe weather conditions; volatility of commodity costs; increases in minimum wage and other operating costs; availability and cost of land and construction; consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the products of the Company and or our competitors, spending patterns and demographic trends; political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates; and the impact that any widespread illness or general health concern may have on our business and or the economy of the countries in which we operate. 48
