Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 56 through 59 (Financial Statements) and the Forward Looking Statements on page 2 and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. Throughout the MD&A, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM or the Company) makes reference to certain performance measures as described below. The Company provides the percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. Same store sales is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company restaurants in generating Company sales divided by Company sales. Operating margin is defined as Operating Profit divided by Total revenue. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements on pages 60 through 106. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. All per share and share amounts herein, and in the accompanying Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the June 26, 2007 stock split (see Note 3). Description of Business YUM is the worlds largest restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with over 36,000 restaurants in more than 110 countries and territories operating under the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers or A&W All American Food Restaurants brands. Four of the Companys restaurant brands KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silvers are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza, Mexican style food and quick service seafood categories, respectively. Of the over 36,000 restaurants, 21% are operated by the Company, 73% are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 6% are operated by licensees. YUMs business consists of three reporting segments: United States, YUM Restaurants International (YRI or International Division) and the China Division. The China Division includes mainland China (China), Thailand and KFC Taiwan and YRI includes the remainder of our international operations. The China Division and YRI have been experiencing dramatic growth and now represent nearly 60% of the Companys operating profits. The U.S. business operates in a highly competitive marketplace resulting in slower profit growth, but continues to produce strong cash flows. 24 Strategies The Company continues to focus on four key strategies: Build Leading Brands in China in Every Significant Category The Company has developed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants, respectively, in mainland China. Additionally, the Company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland China which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage. Given this strong competitive position, a rapidly growing economy and a population of 1.3 billion in mainland China, the Company is rapidly adding KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of Pizza Hut Home Service (pizza delivery) and East Dawning (Chinese food). Our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual system sales growth of 20% in mainland China driven by new unit development each year, which we expect to drive annual operating profit growth of 20% in the China Division. Drive Aggressive International Expansion and Build Strong Brands Everywhere The Company and its franchisees opened over 900 new restaurants in 2008 in the Companys International Division, representing 9 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants. The International Division generated $528 million in Operating Profit in 2008 up from $186 million in 1998. The Company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including India, France and Russia. Our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual operating profit growth of 10% driven by new unit development and same store sales growth for the International Division. New unit development is expected to contribute to system sales growth of at least 6% each year. Dramatically Improve U.S. Brand Positions, Consistency and Returns The Company continues to focus on improving its U.S. position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience. The Company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts. We are the leader in multibranding, with more than 4,600 restaurants providing customers two or more of our brands at a single location. We continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on Company owned restaurants. Our ongoing earnings growth model calls for annual operating profit growth of 5% in the U.S. with same store sales growth of 2% to 3% and leverage of our General and Administrative (G&A) infrastructure. Drive Industry Leading, Long Term Shareholder and Franchisee Value The Company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. The Company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry. Additionally, 2008 was the fourth consecutive year in which the Company returned over $1.1 billion to its shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The Company is targeting an annual dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40% of net income.

The fourth quarter earnings release included preliminary and unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Balance Sheets, which have been updated in this Form 10 K. 2008 Highlights Worldwide system sales growth of 7%, excluding foreign currency translation Worldwide same store sales growth of 3% Record international development of 1,495 new units Worldwide Operating Profit growth of 11%, including a 3%, or $39 million, positive impact as described in the Significant Gains and Charges section of this MD&A Operating Profit growth of 25% in the China Division and 10% in the YRI Division, partially offset by a 6% decline in the U.S. Record shareholder payout of nearly $2 billion through share buybacks and dividends, with share buybacks reducing average diluted share counts by 9% 25 Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results The following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 and could impact comparability with our results in 2009. U.S. Restaurant Profit Our U.S. restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased 0.8 percentage points in 2008 and decreased 1.3 percentage points in 2007. These decreases were the primary drivers in the U.S. Operating Profit declines of 6% and 3% for the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively. Restaurant profit in dollar terms was negatively impacted by $119 million of commodity inflation for the full year 2008. Additionally, restaurant profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by $30 million due to higher property and casualty self insurance expense, exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores, as we lapped favorability in 2007. These decreases were partially offset by Company same store sales growth of 3% resulting from pricing actions we have taken. In 2007, restaurant profit was negatively impacted versus 2006 by Company same store sales declines of 3% (primarily due to Taco Bell) and $44 million of commodity inflation. This unfavorability was partially offset by $27 million of lower self insured property and casualty insurance expense, exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores, driven by improved loss trends. We anticipate that the U.S. restaurant margin as a percentage of sales will improve approximately 1% for the full year 2009 as a result of pricing actions we have taken and the moderation of commodity inflation. China Restaurant Profit China Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was 18.4%, 20.1% and 20.4% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The declines in 2008 and 2007 were driven by commodity inflation, primarily chicken, of approximately $78 million and $34 million, respectively, and higher labor costs. The decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. In the China Division, we expect that commodity inflation will moderate as 2009 progresses and restaurant margin will be at least flat versus 2008. Impact of Foreign Currency Translation on Operating Profit Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted the translation of our foreign currency denominated Operating Profit in our International and China Divisions by $9 million and $41 million, respectively, for the year ended December 27, 2008 and $24 million and $19 million, respectively, for the year ended December 29, 2007. In 2009, we currently expect foreign currency translation to have a significant negative impact on our reported International Division Operating Profit and no significant impact on our reported China Division Operating Profit. Given the nature and volatility of the foreign currency markets the full year forecasted foreign currency impact is difficult to quantify. However, for the first quarter of 2009 we currently expect a $20 million negative impact on YRIs Operating Profit and a similar impact for the second quarter of 2009. 26 Consolidation of a Former Unconsolidated Affiliate in China In 2008, we began consolidating an entity in which we have a majority ownership interest and that operates the KFCs in Beijing, China. Our partners in this entity are essentially state owned enterprises. We historically did not consolidate this entity, instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting, due to the effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business as addressed in Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 96 16, "Investors Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights". Concurrent with a decision that we made on January 1, 2008 regarding top management of the entity, we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, we began consolidating this entity. Like our other unconsolidated affiliates, the accounting for this entity prior to 2008 resulted in royalties being reflected as Franchise and license fees and our share of the entitys net income being reflected in Other (income) expense. The impact on our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 27, 2008 as a result of our consolidation of this entity was as follows: Increase (Decrease) Company sales $ 299 Company restaurant expenses 237 Franchise and license fees (19 ) General and administrative expenses 6 Other (income) expense (30 ) Operating Profit 7 The impact on Other (income) expense includes both the current year minority interest in pre tax earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate as well as the reduction in Other (income) expense that resulted from our share of after tax earnings no longer being reported in Other (income) expense. The increase in Operating Profit was offset by a corresponding increase in Income tax provision such that there was no impact to Net Income. Significant Gains and Charges As part of our plan to transform our U.S. business we took several measures in 2008 that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations. These measures (the U.S. business transformation measures) included: expansion of our U.S. refranchising, potentially reducing our Company ownership in the U.S. to below 10% by year end 2010; charges relating to G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources (primarily severance and early retirement costs); and investments in our U.S. Brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases. As discussed in Note 5, we are not including the impacts of these U.S. business transformation measures in our U.S. segment for performance reporting purposes. In the year ended December 27, 2008, we recorded a pre tax loss of $5 million from refranchising in the U.S., pre tax expense related to U.S. G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources of $49 million, and pre tax expense related to investments in our U.S. brands of $7 million. The refranchising losses are more fully discussed in Note 5 and the Store Portfolio Strategy of the MD&A. These losses were more than offset in the year ended December 27, 2008 by a pre tax gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan (See Note 5 for further discussion of this transaction). This gain was recorded in Other (income) expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. 27 In 2009, we currently expect to refranchise 500 restaurants in the U.S. The impact of this refranchising on our 2009 results will be determined by the stores that we are able to sell and the specific prices we are able to obtain for those stores. In the first quarter of 2009, the expenses related to the U.S. G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources are expected to total approximately $5 million and investments in our U.S. Brands are expected to total approximately $25 million. We currently anticipate ongoing G&A savings of approximately $70 million, primarily within the U.S. segment, as a result of the U.S. business transformation measures we took in 2008 and will take in 2009. Mexico Value Added Tax (VAT) Exemption On October 1, 2007, Mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to VAT payments. Beginning on January 1, 2008, we were required to remit VAT on all Company restaurant sales resulting in lower Company sales and Restaurant profit. As a result of this new legislation, our International Divisions Company sales and Restaurant profit for the year ended December 27, 2008 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $38 million and $34 million, respectively. The International Divisions system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted by approximately 0.3 and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, for the year ended December 27, 2008. For the first quarter of 2009, the negative lapping impact is expected to be $4 million after which there will be no impact on subsequent quarters in 2009. Tax Legislation Mainland China On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress in mainland China enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on January 1, 2008. Upon enactment, which occurred in the China Divisions 2007 second fiscal quarter, the deferred tax balances of all Chinese entities, including our unconsolidated affiliates, were adjusted. These income tax rate changes positively impacted our 2008 net income by approximately $20 million compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted. The impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended December 29, 2007 were not significant. Pizza Hut United Kingdom Acquisition On September 12, 2006, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our Pizza Hut United Kingdom (U.K.) unconsolidated affiliate from our partner, paying approximately $178 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of $9 million of cash assumed. Additionally, we assumed the full liability, as opposed to our fifty percent share, associated with the Pizza Hut U.K.s capital leases of $97 million and short term borrowings of $23 million. This unconsolidated affiliate operated more than 500 restaurants in the U.K. at the date of acquisition. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. Thus, we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate (after interest expense and income taxes) as Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate. Since the date of the acquisition, we have reported Company sales and the associated restaurant costs, G&A expense, interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statement of Income. We no longer record franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate, nor do we report other income under the equity method of accounting. As a result of this acquisition, Company sales and restaurant profit increased $576 million and $59 million, respectively, franchise fees decreased $19 million and G&A expenses increased $33 million in the year ended December 29, 2007 compared to the year ended December 30, 2006. 28 Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of strategic U.S. and international markets. In the U.S., we are targeting Company ownership of restaurants potentially below 10% by year end 2010, down from its current level of 19%. Consistent with this strategy, 700 Company restaurants in the U.S. were sold to franchisees in 2008. We recorded net refranchising losses of $5 million in the U.S. for the year ended December 27, 2008, primarily due to our refranchising of, or our offers to sell, certain stores or groups of stores for a price less than their carrying values. We currently anticipate refranchising 500 units in the U.S. in 2009. We expect U.S. refranchising will generate the following financial impacts over the three year period (2008 2010): pre tax sales proceeds of about $1 billion, U.S. restaurant margin improvement of about 2.5 percentage points, neutral to slightly dilutive to U.S. operating profit and net refranchising gains of about $150 million. While it remains our intent to significantly reduce our ownership levels of Pizza Huts in the U.K. through refranchising, minimal activity took place in 2008. The timing of future refranchising is currently difficult to predict given refranchising results to date and the current economic environment. Refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. Additionally, G&A expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities. The timing of such declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals. G&A expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct G&A that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year. The following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities: 2008 2007 2006 Number of units refranchised 775 420 622 Refranchising proceeds, pretax $ 266 $ 117 $ 257 Refranchising net gains, pretax $ 5 $ 11 $ 24 The impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and G&A expenses and (b) the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised. The tables presented below reflect the impacts on Total revenues and on Operating Profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year. In these tables, Decreased Company sales and Decreased Restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year. Increased Franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the Company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were Company stores in the prior year. The following table summarizes the impact of refranchising as described above: 2008 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (300 ) $ (106 ) $ (5 ) $ (411 ) Increased Franchise and license fees 16 6 22 Decrease in Total revenues $ (284 ) $ (100 ) $ (5 ) $ (389 ) 29 2007 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (374 ) $ (144 ) $ (3 ) $ (521 ) Increased Franchise and license fees 20 9 29 Decrease in Total revenues $ (354 ) $ (135 ) $ (3 ) $ (492 ) The following table summarizes the estimated impact on Operating Profit of refranchising: 2008 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Decreased Restaurant profit $ (19 ) $ (8 ) $ (1 ) $ (28 ) Increased Franchise and license fees 16 6 22 Decreased G&A 7 1 8 Increase (decrease) in Operating Profit $ 4 $ (1 ) $ (1 ) $ 2 2007 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Decreased Restaurant profit $ (37 ) $ (7 ) $ $ (44 ) Increased Franchise and license fees 20 9 29 Decreased G&A 7 3 10 Increase (decrease) in Operating Profit $ (10 ) $ 5 $ $ (5 ) Results of Operations 2008 % B/(W) vs. 2007 2007 % B/(W) vs. 2006 Company sales $ 9,843 8 $ 9,100 9 Franchise and license fees 1,436 9 1,316 10 Total revenues $ 11,279 8 $ 10,416 9 Company restaurant profit $ 1,378 4 $ 1,327 4 % of Company sales 14.0% (0.6 ) ppts. 14.6 % (0.6 ) ppts.

There are no licensed units in the China Division. Licensed units are generally units that offer limited menus and operate in non traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, convenience stores, stadiums and amusement parks where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. As licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units, we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information. 32 (b) In our fiscal quarter ended March 22, 2008, we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan. While we will no longer have an ownership interest in the entity that operates both KFCs and Pizza Huts in Japan, it will continue to be a franchisee as it was when it operated as an unconsolidated affiliate. See Note 5. (c) On January 1, 2008, we began consolidating an entity in China in which we have a majority ownership interest. This entity was previously accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate and we reclassified the units accordingly. See Note 5. Multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. Franchise unit counts include both franchisee and unconsolidated affiliate multibrand units. Multibrand restaurant totals were as follows: 2008 Company Franchise Total U.S. 1,601 3,028 4,629 YRI 329 329 Worldwide 1,601 3,357 4,958 2007 Company Franchise Total U.S. 1,750 1,949 3,699 YRI 6 284 290 Worldwide 1,756 2,233 3,989 For 2008 and 2007, Company multibrand unit gross additions were 251 and 86, respectively. For 2008 and 2007, franchise multibrand unit gross additions were 830 and 283, respectively. There are no multibrand units in the China Division. 33 System Sales Growth System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. The following tables detail the key drivers of system sales growth for each reportable segment by year. Same store sales growth is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more. Net unit growth and other represents the net impact of actual system sales growth due to new unit openings and historical system sales lost due to closures as well as any necessary rounding. 2008 vs. 2007 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) 2 % 4 % 6 % 3 % Net unit growth and other 1 4 14 4 Foreign currency translation (forex) N/A 2 11 1 % Change 3 % 10 % 31 % 8 % % Change, excluding forex N/A 8 % 20 % 7 % 2007 vs. 2006 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) % 6 % 10 % 3 % Net unit growth and other 4 14 3 Foreign currency translation (forex) N/A 5 7 2 % Change % 15 % 31 % 8 % % Change, excluding forex N/A 10 % 24 % 6 % 34 Revenues Company sales were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 U.S. $ 4,410 $ 4,518 $ 4,952 YRI 2,375 2,507 1,826 China Division 3,058 2,075 1,587 Worldwide $ 9,843 $ 9,100 $ 8,365 The following tables detail the key drivers of the year over year changes of Company sales and Franchise and license fees. Same store sales growth is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more. Net unit growth represents the net impact of actual sales or fee additions due to new unit openings and historical sales or fee reductions due to closures. Refranchising represents the amount of Company sales for the periods in the prior year while the Company operated the restaurants but did not operate them in the current year or the impact on Franchise and license fees for amounts from refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the Company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were Company stores in the prior year. Other represents the impact of acquisitions, unusual or significant items and roundings, which are footnoted as necessary. The percentage changes in company sales by year were as follows: 2008 vs. 2007 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) 3 % % 7 % 3 % Net unit growth 1 1 16 4 Refranchising (7 ) (4 ) (5 ) Other(a) 1 13 4 Foreign currency translation (forex) N/A (2 ) 11 2 % Change (2 )% (5 )% 47 % 8 % % Change, excluding forex N/A (3 )% 36 % 6 % 2007 vs. 2006 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) (3 )% 5 % 10 % 2 % Net unit growth 1 2 15 4 Refranchising (8 ) (8 ) (6 ) Other(b) 1 32 (1 ) 6 Foreign currency translation (forex) N/A 6 7 3 % Change (9 )% 37 % 31 % 9 % % Change, excluding forex N/A 31 % 24 % 6 % (a) China and Worldwide include 13 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively, attributable to the consolidation of a former China unconsolidated affiliate at the beginning of 2008.

The decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin including the impact of higher average guest check. In 2007, the decrease in U.S. restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of higher commodity costs (primarily cheese and meats) and higher wage rates, due primarily to state minimum wage rate increases. The decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower self insured property and casualty insurance expense driven by improved loss trends, as well as the favorable impact on restaurant margin of refranchising and closing certain restaurants. In 2008, the decrease in YRI restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the elimination of a VAT exemption in Mexico. An increase in commodity costs was partially offset by higher average guest check. In 2007, the increase in YRI restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin as well as the favorable impact of refranchising certain restaurants. The increase was almost fully offset by higher labor costs (primarily wage rates) and the impact of lower margins associated with Pizza Hut units in the U.K. which we now operate. As a percentage of sales, Pizza Hut U.K. restaurants negatively impacted payroll and employee benefits and occupancy and other expenses and positively impacted food and paper. 37 In 2008, the decrease in China Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by higher commodity costs (primarily chicken products), the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation, and higher labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. In 2007, the decrease in China Division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was driven by higher commodity costs (primarily chicken products), the impact of lower margins associated with new units during the initial periods of operation and higher labor costs. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin. Worldwide General and Administrative Expenses G&A expenses increased 4% in 2008, including a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. This increase was driven by approximately $49 million of G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources related to the U.S. transformation as discussed in the Significant Gains & Charges section of this MD&A. G&A expenses increased 9% in 2007, including a 2% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the additional G&A expenses associated with acquiring the Pizza Hut U.K. business (which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the business) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, G&A expense increased 4%. The increase was driven by higher annual incentive and other compensation costs, including amounts associated with strategic initiatives in China and other international growth markets. Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses increased 86% in 2008. The increase was driven by higher marketing funding on behalf of franchisees, investments in our U.S. brands as discussed in the Significant Gains & Charges section of this MD&A and increased provision for uncollectible receivables. Franchise and license expenses increased 14% in 2007. The increase was driven by higher marketing funding on behalf of franchisees, franchise convention costs and increased provision for uncollectible receivables.

The decrease was driven by higher restaurant operating costs and higher closure and impairment expenses, partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant profit (primarily due to higher average guest check) and Franchise and license fees. The increase in restaurant operating costs was primarily driven by higher commodity costs. U.S. Operating Profit decreased 3% in 2007. The decrease was driven by higher restaurant operating costs, principally commodities and labor, partially offset by lower G&A expenses, lower closure and impairment expenses and an increase in Other income. YRI Operating Profit increased 10% in 2008, including a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and net unit development on Franchise and license fees. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the VAT exemption in Mexico. 39 YRI Operating Profit increased 18% in 2007 including a 6% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development on restaurant profit and franchise and license fees. The increase was partially offset by higher G&A expenses (including expenses which were previously netted within equity income prior to our acquisition of the remaining fifty percent of the Pizza Hut U.K. business) and higher restaurant operating costs. China Division Operating Profit increased 25% and 30% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, including an 11% and 7% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, respectively. The increases were driven by the impact of same store sales growth and net unit development on restaurant profit. The increases were partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and higher G&A expenses. Unallocated and corporate expenses increased 19% in 2008 due to U.S. G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources and investments in the U.S. Brands, as discussed in the Significant Gains and Charges section of this MD&A, partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation expenses. The 12% increase in unallocated and corporate expenses in 2007 was driven by an increase in annual incentive compensation and project costs. Unallocated Other income (expense) in 2008 includes a $100 million gain recognized on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan. See Note 5. Interest Expense, Net 2008 2007 2006 Interest expense $ 253 $ 199 $ 172 Interest income (27 ) (33 ) (18 ) Interest expense, net $ 226 $ 166 $ 154 Net interest expense increased $60 million or 36% in 2008. The increase was driven by an increase in borrowings in 2008 compared to 2007, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates in the variable portion of our debt as compared to prior year. Net interest expense increased $12 million or 8% in 2007. The increase was driven by an increase in borrowings in 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by an increase in interest bearing cash equivalents in 2007 compared to 2006. Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 Reported Income taxes $ 316 $ 282 $ 284 Effective tax rate 24.7 % 23.7 % 25.6 % 40 The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2008 2007 2006 U.S. federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 0.6 1.0 2.0 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (14.5 ) (5.7 ) (7.8 ) Adjustments to reserves and prior years 3.5 2.6 (3.5 ) Repatriation of foreign earnings (0.4 ) Non recurring foreign tax credit adjustments (6.2 ) Valuation allowance additions (reversals) 0.6 (9.0 ) 6.8 Other, net (0.5 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Effective income tax rate 24.7 % 23.7 % 25.6 % Our 2008 effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by lapping valuation allowance reversals made in the prior year as discussed below. This negative impact was partially offset by the reversal of foreign valuation allowances in the current year associated with certain deferred tax assets that we now believe are more likely than not to be utilized on future tax returns. Additionally, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the year over year change in adjustments to reserves and prior years (including certain out of year adjustments that increased our effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points in 2008). Benefits associated with our foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations positively impacted the effective tax rate as a result of lapping 2007 expenses associated with the distribution of an intercompany dividend and adjustments to our deferred tax balances that resulted from the Mexico tax law change, as further discussed below, as well as a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the U.S. These benefits were partially offset in 2008 by the gain on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan and expense associated with our plan to distribute certain foreign earnings. We also recognized deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by certain tax planning strategies implemented in 2008 included in foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (1.7 percentage point impact). However, we provided a full valuation allowance on these assets as we do not believe it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future. Our 2007 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals. In December 2007, the Company finalized various tax planning strategies based on completing a review of our international operations, distributed a $275 million intercompany dividend and sold our interest in our Japan unconsolidated affiliate. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we reversed approximately $82 million of valuation allowances associated with foreign tax credit carryovers that are more likely than not to be claimed on future tax returns. In 2007, benefits associated with our foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations were negatively impacted by $36 million of expense associated with the $275 million intercompany dividend and approximately $20 million of expense for adjustments to our deferred tax balances as a result of the Mexico tax law change enacted during the fourth quarter of 2007. These negative impacts were partially offset by a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the U.S. Additionally, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the year over year change in adjustments to reserves and prior years. Our 2006 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular U.S. audit cycle as well as certain out of year adjustments to reserves and accruals that lowered our effective income tax rate by 2.2 percentage points. The reversal of tax reserves was partially offset by valuation allowance additions on foreign tax credits for which, as a result of the tax reserve reversals, we believed were not likely to be utilized before they expired. We also recognized deferred tax assets for the foreign tax credit impact of non recurring decisions to repatriate certain foreign earnings in 2007. However, we provided full valuation allowances on such assets as we did not believe it was more likely than not that they would be realized at that time. 41 Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves, including interest thereon, established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,521 million compared to $1,551 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest payments and pension contributions. In 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,551 million compared to $1,257 million in 2006. The increase was driven by higher net income, lower pension contributions and lower income tax payments in 2007. Net cash used in investing activities was $641 million versus $416 million in 2007. The increase was driven by higher capital spending in 2008 and the lapping of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the Japan unconsolidated affiliate in 2007, partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants. In December 2007, we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan for $128 million (includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in December 2007). The international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close. Thus, consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period, the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of $100 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008. However, the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the U.S. in December 2007 and were thus reported on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 29, 2007. The offset to this cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 29, 2007 was in accounts payable and other current liabilities. In 2007, net cash used in investing activities was $416 million versus $434 million in 2006. The decrease was driven by the lapping of the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Pizza Hut U.K. unconsolidated affiliate in 2006 and proceeds from the sale of our interest in the Japan unconsolidated affiliate in December 2007, partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants and a 2007 increase in capital spending. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,459 million versus $678 million in 2007. The increase was driven by lower net borrowings, higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments in 2008. In 2007, net cash used in financing activities was $678 million versus $670 million in 2006. The increase was driven by higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings. Consolidated Financial Condition Upon recognition of the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan, as described above, during the first quarter 2008 accounts payable and other current liabilities decreased by $128 million due to the reversal of the associated deferred gain. In May 2008, $250 million of Senior Unsecured Notes matured, and the repayment was funded with additional borrowings under our Credit Facility, which are included in Long term debt. 42 During 2008 our Shareholders Equity decreased approximately $1.2 billion resulting in the Company ending the year with a Shareholders Deficit. This decrease was primarily driven by our shareholder payouts of approximately $2 billion through share buybacks and dividends, a decline in the unrecognized funded status of our U.S. pension plans of approximately $200 million and approximately $200 million of foreign currency translation adjustments during the year due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. These declines were partially offset by the Companys Net income for the year ended December 27, 2008. A recorded Shareholders Deficit under generally accepted accounting principles does not by itself preclude us from paying dividends to our shareholders or repurchasing shares of our Common Stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last seven fiscal years, net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1.1 billion. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. Additionally, we estimate that refranchising proceeds, prior to income taxes, will total at least $250 million in 2009. However, unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized or our refranchising proceeds from those amounts expected. In the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns, we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Additionally, as of December, 2008 we had approximately $1 billion in unused capacity under revolving credit facilities that expire in 2012. Given this available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, our debt maturity schedule and our ability to reduce discretionary spending, we do not believe we will need to access the credit markets during 2009. To help ensure that we do not need to access the credit markets while continuing to build our liquidity and maintaining our financial flexibility, we do not currently plan to repurchase shares in 2009. Additionally, we are managing our cash and debt positions in order to maintain our current investment grade ratings from Standard & Poors Rating Services (BBB ) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa3). A downgrade of our credit rating would increase the Companys current borrowing costs and could impact the Companys ability to access the credit markets if necessary. Based on the amount and composition of our debt at December 27, 2008 our interest expense would increase approximately $1.3 million on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings. Discretionary Spending During 2008, we invested $935 million in our businesses, including approximately $355 million in the U.S., $260 million for the International Division and $320 million for the China Division. For 2009, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $900 million. We returned approximately $2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends in 2008. This is the fourth straight year that we returned over $1.1 billion to our shareholders. Under the authority of our Board of Directors, we repurchased 46.8 million shares of our Common Stock for $1.6 billion during 2008. As mentioned above, the Company does not currently plan to repurchase shares during 2009. During the year ended December 27, 2008, we paid cash dividends of $322 million. Additionally, on November 21, 2008 our Board of Directors approved cash dividends of $.19 per share of Common Stock to be distributed on February 6, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2009. The Company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35% 40% of net income. 43 Borrowing Capacity Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.15 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which matures in November 2012 and includes 23 participating banks with commitments ranging from $20 million to $113 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or bankers acceptances, where applicable. At December 27, 2008, our unused Credit Facility totaled $685 million net of outstanding letters of credit of $166 million. There were borrowings of $299 million outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 27, 2008. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.25% to 1.25% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or is determined by an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. We also have a $350 million, syndicated revolving credit facility (the International Credit Facility, or ICF) which matures in November 2012 and includes 6 banks with commitments ranging from $35 million to $90 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. There was available credit of $350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2008. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.31% to 1.50% over LIBOR or is determined by a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branchs publicly announced reference rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUMs performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly. On July 11, 2008 we entered into a variable rate senior unsecured term loan (Domestic Term Loan), in an aggregate principal amount of $375 million that matures in three years. At our discretion the variable rate resets at one, two, three or six month intervals. We determine whether the variable rate at each reset date is based upon: (1) LIBOR plus an applicable spread of up to 2.5%, or (2) an Alternative Base Rate. The Alternate Base Rate is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, plus an applicable spread of up to 1.5%. The proceeds from the Domestic Term Loan were used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility, Domestic Term Loan, and the ICF are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, the ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM. These agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. Given the Companys strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at December 27, 2008 with a considerable amount of cushion. The majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes with varying maturity dates from 2011 through 2037 and interest rates ranging from 6.25% to 8.88%. The Senior Unsecured Notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $2.6 billion at December 27, 2008. In May 2008, $250 million of Senior Unsecured Notes matured, and the repayment was funded with additional borrowings under our Credit Facility. 44 Contractual Obligations In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, our significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 27, 2008 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt obligations(a) $ 5,224 $ 201 $ 1,365 $ 925 $ 2,733 Capital leases(b) 384 26 87 43 228 Operating leases(b) 4,576 491 860 701 2,524 Purchase obligations(c) 675 570 96 6 3 Other(d) 169 144 9 7 9 Total contractual obligations $ 11,028 $ 1,432 $ 2,417 $ 1,682 $ 5,497 (a) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments. Rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on an estimate of future interest rates. Excludes a fair value adjustment of $59 million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 12. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to more than 5,800 restaurants. See Note 13. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements. (d) Other consists of 2009 pension plan funding obligations, the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and projected payments for deferred compensation. We have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $229 million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. These liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow. We have included in the contractual obligations table $53 million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in cash in the next year. We have included $85 million in contributions we expect to make to our pension plans in 2009 in the contractual obligations table. Our most significant plan, the YUM Retirement Plan (the U.S. Plan), is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain full time U.S. salaried employees. Our funding policy with respect to the U.S. Plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, including requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, plus such additional amounts from time to time as determined to be appropriate to improve the U.S. Plans funded status. We currently estimate that we will contribute approximately $80 million to the U.S. Plan in 2009. Contributions beyond 2009 will depend upon the timing and amount of our asset returns as well as changes in applicable discount rates. At our 2008 measurement date, our pension plans in the U.S., which include the U.S. Plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan, had a projected benefit obligation of $923 million and plan assets of $513 million. 45 The funding rules for our pension plans outside of the U.S. vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates, performance of plan assets, local laws and regulations. Our most significant plans are in the U.K. The projected benefit obligation of our pension plans in the U.K. exceeded plan assets by $43 million at our 2008 measurement date. We have committed to make a discretionary funding contribution of approximately $5 million in 2009 to one of these plans. The plans are currently under review to determine if additional discretionary pension funding payments will be committed to in 2009. Our postretirement plan in the U.S. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made postretirement benefit payments of $5 million in 2008 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table. See Note 15 for further details about our pension and postretirement plans. We have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured, including workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) and employee healthcare and long term disability claims. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare, long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have provided a partial guarantee of approximately $16 million of a franchisee loan program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and, to a lesser extent, in connection with the Companys historical refranchising programs at December 27, 2008. We have also provided two letters of credit totaling approximately $23 million in support of the franchisee loan program. One such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee. The other letter of credit could be used, in certain circumstances, to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program. The total loans outstanding under the loan pool were approximately $48 million at December 27, 2008. Our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately $51 million and $22 million of debt outstanding as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. 46 Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We evaluate our restaurant assets and certain definite lived intangible assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Impairment evaluations for individual restaurants that we are currently operating and have not offered for sale are performed on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable (including a decision to close a restaurant). Our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses. Our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of forecasted cash flows of the restaurant and any terminal value. We limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. If the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted, undiscounted cash flows, we write the assets down to their fair value. This fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted after tax cash flows, including terminal value, of the restaurant. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a restaurant or groups of restaurants and its related long lived assets. The discount rate incorporates observed rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and we believe it is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. We often refranchise restaurants in groups and, therefore, perform such impairment evaluations at the group level. These impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale. Forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds. Expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers, and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. We have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant, such as the LJS and A&W trademark/brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights, which are amortized over their expected useful lives. We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept. We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate. These definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the assets future remaining life. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business management units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using either discounted expected future cash flows from operations or the present value of the estimated future franchise royalty stream plus any estimated sales proceeds from refranchising. 47 Future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Future cash flows are based on our growth expectations relative to recent historical performance. These growth expectations are based on assumptions for key performance indicators such as company sales, franchise and license fees and restaurant profit and are consistent with our internal operating plans. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. We believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. We have two international reporting units that have experienced deteriorating operating performance over the past few years. These reporting units have goodwill of $100 million and $36 million as of the end of 2008. The assumptions used in determining fair value for these reporting units reflect our belief that the businesses are experiencing temporary declines and that they will turn around. While these growth assumptions are consistent with our internal operating plans and reflect what we believe are reasonable and achievable growth rates, failure to realize these growth rates could result in future impairment of some or all of the recorded goodwill. Likewise, if we believe the risks inherent in the businesses increase, the resulting change in the discount rate could result in future impairment of some or all of the recorded goodwill. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill. Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/Lease Guarantees We reserve a franchisees or licensees entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. As a result of reserving using this methodology, we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at December 27, 2008. We have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants. Such guarantees are subject to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections (SFAS 145). We recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under SFAS 145 upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable. The fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties. If payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees. At December 27, 2008, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable. The potential total exposure under such leases is significant, with approximately $325 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 27, 2008. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and, historically, we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. See Note 14 for a further discussion of our lease guarantees. 48 Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 21 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans are in the U.S. We have recorded the under funded status of $410 million for these U.S. plans as a pension liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 27, 2008. These U.S. plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $923 million and a fair value of plan assets of $513 million at December 27, 2008. The PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. For our U.S. plans, we measured our PBO using a discount rate of 6.5% at December 27, 2008. This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary. The primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated Aa or higher by Moodys with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. We excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by Moodys for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year. The weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $64 million at our measurement date. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $74 million at our measurement dates. The pension expense we will record in 2009 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date. We expect pension expense for our U.S. plans to increase approximately $3 million to $39 million in 2009. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2009 U.S. pension expense by approximately $12 million. The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our estimated long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions. Our expected long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets at December 27, 2008 was 8.0%. We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our 2009 U.S. pension plan expense by approximately $7 million. 49 The losses our U.S. plan assets have experienced, along with a decrease in discount rates over time, have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax net loss of $374 million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the U.S. plans at December 27, 2008. For purposes of determining 2008 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $6 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost. We will recognize approximately $13 million of such loss in 2009. See Note 15 for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Expense Compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated on the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 16. Additionally, under SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Compensation (SFAS 123R) we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions. We have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures. These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the RGM Plan) and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans. Historically, approximately 15% 20% of total options and SARs granted have been made under the RGM Plan. Grants under the RGM Plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25% per year over four years. We use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by SFAS 123R. We revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis. Based on the results of this analysis, we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives. Upon each stock award grant we revaluate the expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options. We have estimated forfeitures based on historical data. Based on such data, we believe that approximately 50% of all awards granted under the RGM Plan will be forfeited and approximately 20% of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited. Income Taxes At December 27, 2008, we had a valuation allowance of $254 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of $256 million, as well as our other deferred tax assets, to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal, state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage, including approximately $150 million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. 50 As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Effective December 31, 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 27, 2008, we had $296 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $225 million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Since adopting FIN 48, we have evaluated unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. Additionally, we have not recorded the deferred tax impact for certain undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries totaling approximately $1.1 billion at December 27, 2008, as we believe these amounts are indefinitely reinvested. If our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances, deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact income taxes. See Note 19 for a further discussion of our income taxes. 51 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the U.S. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $9 million and $3 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 would decrease approximately $35 million and $31 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 would decrease approximately $120 million and $173 million, respectively. Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The combined International Division and China Division Operating Profits constitute approximately 60% of our Operating Profit in 2008, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 27, 2008, Operating Profit would have decreased $109 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors. 52
