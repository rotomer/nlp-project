Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 61 through 64 (Financial Statements) and the Forward Looking Statements on page 2 and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. Throughout the MD&A, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM or the Company) makes reference to certain performance measures as described below. The Company provides the percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation (FX or Forex). These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. Same store sales is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more. Company restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company restaurants in generating Company sales. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as Company restaurant profit divided by Company sales. Operating margin is defined as Operating Profit divided by Total revenue. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements on pages 65 through 116. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. All per share and share amounts herein, and in the accompanying Financial Statements and Notes to the Financial Statements have been adjusted to reflect the June 26, 2007 stock split (see Note 3). Description of Business YUM is the worlds largest restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with over 37,000 restaurants in more than 110 countries and territories operating under the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers or A&W All American Food Restaurants brands. Four of the Companys restaurant brands KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silvers are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza, Mexican style food and quick service seafood categories, respectively. Of the over 37,000 restaurants, 21% are operated by the Company, 73% are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 6% are operated by licensees. YUMs business consists of three reporting segments: United States, YUM Restaurants International (YRI or International Division) and the China Division. The China Division includes mainland China (China), Thailand and KFC Taiwan and YRI includes the remainder of our international operations. The China Division, YRI and Taco Bell U.S. now represent approximately 85% of the Companys operating profits. Our KFC U.S. and Pizza Hut U.S. businesses operate in highly competitive marketplaces resulting in slower profit growth, but continue to produce strong cash flows. 24 Segment Reporting Changes In the first quarter of 2010 we will begin reporting information for our Thailand and KFC Taiwan businesses within our International Division as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. The China Division will only consist of operations in mainland China and the International Division will include the remainder of our international operations. While our consolidated results will not be impacted, we will restate our historical segment information during 2010 for consistent presentation. All forward looking information within this MD&A reflects these changes in our reporting structure. In connection with our U.S. business transformation measures our reported segment results began reflecting increased allocations of certain expenses in 2009 that were previously reported as unallocated and corporate G&A expenses. While our consolidated results were not impacted, we believe the revised allocation better aligns costs with accountability of our segment managers. These revised allocations are being used by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in his role as chief operating decision maker, in his assessment of operating performance. We have restated segment information for the years ended December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 to be consistent with the current period presentation. The following table summarizes the 2008 and 2007 impact of the revised allocations by segment: Increase/(Decrease) 2008 2007 U.S. G&A $ 53 $ 54 YRI G&A 6 6 Unallocated and corporate G&A expenses (59 ) (60 ) Strategies The Company continues to focus on four key strategies: Build Leading Brands in China in Every Significant Category The Company has developed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants, respectively, in mainland China. Additionally, the Company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland China which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage. Given this strong competitive position, a growing economy and a population of 1.3 billion in mainland China, the Company is rapidly adding KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of Pizza Hut Home Service (pizza delivery) and East Dawning (Chinese food). Our ongoing earnings growth model in mainland China is driven by new unit development each year and modest same store sales growth, which we expect to drive annual Operating Profit growth of 15%. Drive Aggressive International Expansion and Build Strong Brands Everywhere The Company and its franchisees opened approximately 900 new restaurants in 2009 in the Companys International Division, representing 10 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants, and is the leading international retail developer in terms of units opened. The Company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including France, Russia and India. The International Divisions Operating Profit has experienced a 7 year compound annual growth rate of 11%. Our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual Operating Profit growth of 10% driven by new unit development, modest same store sales growth, modest margin improvement and leverage of our General and Administrative (G&A) infrastructure for YRI. 25 Dramatically Improve U.S. Brand Positions, Consistency and Returns The Company continues to focus on improving its U.S. position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience. The Company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts. We continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on Company owned restaurants. Our ongoing earnings growth model calls for annual Operating Profit growth of 5% in the U.S. with same store sales growth of 2%, modest restaurant margin improvement and leverage of our G&A infrastructure. Drive Industry Leading, Long Term Shareholder and Franchisee Value The Company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The Company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry. The Companys dividend and share repurchase programs have returned over $1 billion and $6 billion to shareholders, respectively, since 2004. The Company is targeting an annual dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40% of net income and has increased the quarterly dividend each year since inception in 2004. Shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions. 26 Details of our 2010 Guidance by division can be found online at http://www.yum.com. 2009 Highlights Diluted EPS growth of 13% or $2.17 per share, excluding Special Items. Worldwide system sales growth of 1% prior to foreign currency translation. Worldwide revenue declined 4% driven by foreign currency translation and refranchising. International development of 1,467 new restaurants including 509 in mainland China and 898 in YRI. Worldwide Operating Profit growth of 9% prior to foreign currency translation and Special Items, including growth of 23% in the China Division, 5% in YRI and 1% in the U.S. After foreign currency translation, but prior to Special Items, worldwide Operating Profit growth was 6%. Worldwide restaurant margin improved by 1.7 percentage points driven by the China Division and the U.S. Diluted EPS growth was negatively impacted by approximately $0.07 per share due to foreign currency translation that was fully offset by lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. 27 Results of Operations Amount % B/(W) 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Company sales $ 9,413 $ 9,843 $ 9,100 (4 ) 8 Franchise and license fees and income 1,423 1,461 1,335 (3 ) 9 Total revenues $ 10,836 $ 11,304 $ 10,435 (4 ) 8 Company restaurant profit $ 1,479 $ 1,378 $ 1,327 7 4 % of Company sales 15.7% 14.0% 14.6% 1.7 ppts.

Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results Special Items In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) above and throughout this document, the Company has provided non GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2009 and 2008 on a basis before Special Items. Included in Special Items are the impact of measures we took to transform our U.S. business (the U.S. business transformation measures) including: the U.S. refranchising (gain) loss, charges relating to U.S. General and Administrative (G&A) productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, investments in our U.S. Brands and a 2009 U.S. Goodwill impairment charge. Special items also include the 2009 loss recognized as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise an equity market outside the U.S., the 2009 gain upon our acquisition of additional ownership in, and consolidation of, the operating entity that owns the KFCs in Shanghai, China, and the 2008 gain on the sale of our minority interest in our Japan unconsolidated affiliate. These amounts are further described below. 28 The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. This non GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2009 and 2008 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and or nature.

We do not believe these measures are indicative of our ongoing operations and are not including the impacts of these U.S. business transformation measures in our U.S. segment for performance reporting purposes. In the years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, we recorded a pre tax gain of $34 million and a pre tax loss of $5 million from refranchising in the U.S., respectively. In 2010, we currently expect to refranchise 500 restaurants in the U.S. The impact of this refranchising on our 2010 results will be determined by the stores that we are able to sell and the specific prices we are able to obtain for those stores. Additionally, to the extent we offer to sell a store or group of stores at a loss, such loss is recorded at the date we make such offer. Gains upon refranchising, however, are not recorded until we consummate the sale. This timing difference can create quarterly or annual earnings volatility as decisions are made to refranchise a portfolio of stores. As a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our LJS and A&W U.S. businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding, we recorded a non cash charge of $26 million, which resulted in no related income tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2009 to write off goodwill associated with these businesses. In connection with our G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources (primarily severance and early retirement costs) we recorded pre tax charges of $16 million and $49 million in the years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively. We realized a $65 million decline in our U.S. G&A expenses in the year ended December 26, 2009 driven by the U.S. productivity initiatives and realignment of resources measures we took in 2008 and 2009. Additionally, the Company recognized a reduction to Franchise and license fees and income of $32 million, pre tax, in the year ended December 26, 2009 related to investments in our U.S. Brands. These investments reflect our reimbursements to KFC franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. The reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship. In the year ended December 27, 2008, the Company recognized pre tax expense of $7 million related to investments in our U.S. Brands in Franchise and license expenses. 30 Consolidation of a Former Unconsolidated Affiliate in Shanghai, China On May 4, 2009 we acquired an additional 7% ownership in the entity that operates more than 200 KFCs in Shanghai, China for $12 million, increasing our ownership to 58%. This entity has historically been accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting. Concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition. As required by GAAP, we remeasured our previously held 51% ownership, which had a recorded value of $17 million at the date of acquisition, in the entity at fair value and recognized a gain of $68 million accordingly. This gain, which resulted in no related income tax expense, was recorded in Other (income) expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. Under the equity method of accounting, we previously reported our 51% share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate (after interest expense and income taxes) as Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate. Subsequent to the date of the acquisition, we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statement of Income. We no longer record franchise fee income for these restaurants nor do we report Other (income) expense as we did under the equity method of accounting. Net income attributable to our partners ownership percentage is recorded as Net Income noncontrolling interest within our Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 26, 2009 the consolidation of this entity increased Company sales by $192 million and decreased Franchise and license fees and income by $12 million. The consolidation of this entity positively impacted Operating Profit by $4 million in 2009. The impact on Net Income YUM! Brands, Inc. was not significant to the year ended December 26, 2009. Prior to lapping the acquisition of this entity during the second quarter of 2010, we expect the impact of this transaction to increase the China Divisions Company sales by approximately $100 million, decrease Franchise and license fees and income by approximately $6 million and provide a modest increase to Operating Profit during the first half of 2010. Refranchising of an International Equity Market In the third quarter of 2009 we recognized a $10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our KFC Taiwan equity market. This loss, which resulted in no related income tax benefit, was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. This market was refranchised on January 31, 2010. We are currently evaluating what amount of the $37 million in goodwill associated with KFC Taiwan should be written off in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of this refranchising. Sale of our Interest in our Unconsolidated Affiliate in Japan During the year ended December 27, 2008 we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan (See Note 5 for further discussion of this transaction). This gain was recorded in Other (income) expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. 31 Restaurant Profit The U.S. restaurant margin increased 1.4 percentage points in 2009. This increase was largely driven by commodity deflation of $28 million and productivity initiatives partially offset by Company same store sales declines of 4%. Additionally, our U.S. store portfolio actions, including the refranchising of 541 stores during 2009, positively impacted our restaurant margin by 0.4 percentage points. Our U.S. restaurant margin decreased 0.8 percentage points in 2008. Restaurant profit was negatively impacted by $119 million of commodity inflation for the full year 2008. Additionally, restaurant profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by $30 million due to higher property and casualty self insurance expense, exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores, as we lapped favorability in 2007. These decreases were partially offset by Company same store sales growth of 3% resulting from pricing actions we took. China Division restaurant margin increased 1.8 percentage points and declined 1.7 percentage points in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 improvement was largely driven by commodity deflation of $61 million offsetting Company same store sales declines 1%. Commodity inflation of $78 million and higher labor costs partially offset by Company same store sales growth of 7% drove the 2008 restaurant margin decline. 32 Impact of Foreign Currency Translation on Operating Profit Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted the translation of our foreign currency denominated Operating Profit in our International Division by $56 million and positively impacted Operating Profit in our China Division by $10 million for the year ended December 26, 2009. In the year ended December 27, 2008 our Operating Profit in our International and China Divisions was positively impacted by $9 million and $42 million, respectively, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Pizza Hut South Korea Goodwill Impairment As a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our Pizza Hut South Korea market we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $12 million for this market during 2009. This charge was recorded in Closure and impairment (income) expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was allocated to our International Division for performance reporting purposes. Consolidation of a Former Unconsolidated Affiliate in Beijing, China In 2008, we began consolidating an entity in which we have a majority ownership interest and that operates the KFCs in Beijing, China. Our partners in this entity are essentially state owned enterprises. We historically did not consolidate this entity, instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting, due to the effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business. Concurrent with a decision that we made on January 1, 2008 regarding top management of the entity, we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with GAAP, we began consolidating this entity on that date. Like our other unconsolidated affiliates, the accounting for this entity prior to 2008 resulted in royalties being reflected as Franchise and license fees and our share of the entitys net income being reflected in Other (income) expense. Subsequent to the date of consolidation, we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statement of Income. We no longer record franchise fee income for these restaurants nor do we report Other (income) expense as we did under the equity method of accounting. Net income attributable to our partners ownership percentage is recorded as Net Income noncontrolling interest within our Consolidated Statement of Income. For the year ended December 27, 2008 the consolidation of this entity increased the China Divisions Company sales by approximately $300 million and decreased Franchise and license fees and income by approximately $20 million. The consolidation of this entity positively impacted Operating Profit by approximately $20 million in 2008. The positive impact on Operating Profit was offset by Net Income noncontrolling interest of $8 million and a higher Income tax provision such that there was no impact on Net Income YUM! Brands, Inc. for the year ended December 27, 2008. The Consolidated Statement of Income was impacted by similar amounts for the year ended December 26, 2009. 33 Mexico Value Added Tax (VAT) Exemption On October 1, 2007, Mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to VAT payments. Beginning on January 1, 2008, we were required to remit VAT on all Company restaurant sales resulting in lower Company sales and Restaurant profit. As a result of this new legislation, our International Divisions Company sales and Restaurant profit for the year ended December 27, 2008 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $38 million and $34 million, respectively. The International Divisions system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted by approximately 0.3 and 1.2 percentage points, respectively, for the year ended December 27, 2008. The 2009 impact versus 2008 was not significant to our International Divisions results of operations. Tax Legislation Mainland China On March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress in mainland China enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on January 1, 2008. Upon enactment, which occurred in the China Divisions 2007 second fiscal quarter, the deferred tax balances of all Chinese entities, including our unconsolidated affiliates, were adjusted. These income tax rate changes positively impacted our 2009 and 2008 Net Income YUM! Brands, Inc. by approximately $15 million and $20 million, respectively, compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted. The impacts on our Income tax provision and Operating Profit in the year ended December 29, 2007 were not significant. Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of strategic U.S. and international markets. In the U.S., we are targeting Company ownership of restaurants potentially below 10%, down from its current level of 16%. Consistent with this strategy, 541, 700 and 304 Company restaurants in the U.S. were sold to franchisees in the years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively. Refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. Additionally, G&A expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities. The timing of G&A declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals. G&A expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct G&A that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year. The following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities: 2009 2008 2007 Number of units refranchised 613 775 420 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 194 $ 266 $ 117 Refranchising net gains, pre tax $ 26 $ 5 $ 11 34 The impact on Operating Profit arising from refranchising is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and G&A expenses and (b) the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised. The tables presented below reflect the impacts on Total revenues and on Operating Profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year. In these tables, Decreased Company sales and Decreased Restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year. Increased Franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the Company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were Company stores in the prior year.

As licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units, we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information. 37 (b) In our fiscal quarter ended March 22, 2008, we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan. While we will no longer have an ownership interest in the entity that operates both KFCs and Pizza Huts in Japan, it will continue to be a franchisee as it was when it operated as an unconsolidated affiliate. See Note 5. (c) On January 1, 2008, we began consolidating an entity in China in which we have a majority ownership interest. This entity was previously accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate and we reclassified the units accordingly. See Note 5. (d) During the second quarter of 2009 we acquired additional ownership in and began consolidating an entity that operates the KFC business in Shanghai, China and have reclassified the units accordingly. This entity was previously accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate. Multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. System Sales Growth The following tables detail the key drivers of system sales growth for each reportable segment by year. Net unit growth represents the net impact of actual system sales growth due to new unit openings and historical system sales lost due to closures as well as any necessary rounding. 2009 vs. 2008 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) (5) % 1 % (2) % (2) % Net unit growth and other 1 4 11 3 Foreign currency translation N/A (8) 1 (3) % Change (4) % (3) % 10 % (2) % % Change, excluding forex N/A 5 % 9 % 1 % 2008 vs. 2007 U.S. YRI China Division Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) 2 % 4 % 6 % 3 % Net unit growth and other 1 4 14 4 Foreign currency translation N/A 2 11 1 % Change 3 % 10 % 31 % 8 % % Change, excluding forex N/A 8 % 20 % 7 % 38 Company Operated Store Results The following tables detail the key drivers of the year over year changes of Company Sales and Restaurant Profit. Store portfolio actions represent the net impact of new unit openings, acquisitions, refranchisings and store closures on Company Sales or Restaurant Profit. The impact of new unit openings and acquisitions represent the actual Company Sales or Restaurant Profit for the periods the Company operated the restaurants in the current year but did not operate them in the prior year. The impact of refranchisings and store closures represent the actual Company Sales or Restaurant Profit for the periods in the prior year while the Company operated the restaurants but did not operate them in the current year. The dollar changes in Company Restaurant Profit by year were as follows: U.S. 2009 vs. 2008 Income / (Expense) 2008 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2009 Company Sales $ 4,410 $ (515 ) $ (157 ) $ N/A $ 3,738 Cost of Sales (1,335 ) 158 107 N/A (1,070 ) Cost of Labor (1,329 ) 157 51 N/A (1,121 ) Occupancy and Other (1,195 ) 154 13 N/A (1,028 ) Restaurant Profit $ 551 $ (46 ) $ 14 $ N/A $ 519 Restaurant Margin 12.5 % 13.9 % 2008 vs. 2007 Income / (Expense) 2007 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2008 Company Sales $ 4,518 $ (242 ) $ 134 $ N/A $ 4,410 Cost of Sales (1,317 ) 75 (93 ) N/A (1,335 ) Cost of Labor (1,377 ) 75 (27 ) N/A (1,329 ) Occupancy and Other (1,221 ) 77 (51 ) N/A (1,195 ) Restaurant Profit $ 603 $ (15 ) $ (37 ) $ N/A $ 551 Restaurant Margin 13.3 % 12.5 % In 2009, the decrease in U.S. Company Sales and Restaurant Profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by refranchising. Significant other factors impacting Company Sales and or Restaurant Profit were Company same store sales decline of 4%, commodity deflation of $28 million (primarily cheese), and cost savings associated with productivity initiatives. In 2008, the decrease in U.S. Company Sales and Restaurant Profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by refranchising. Significant other factors impacting Company Sales and or Restaurant Profit were Company same store sales growth of 3%, commodity inflation of $119 million (primarily cheese, meat, chicken and wheat costs), higher labor costs (primarily wage rate and salary increases) and higher property and casualty insurance expense as we lapped favorability recognized in 2007. 39 YRI 2009 vs. 2008 Income / (Expense) 2008 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2009 Company Sales $ 2,375 $ 26 $ 34 $ (382 ) $ 2,053 Cost of Sales (752 ) (11 ) (16 ) 123 (656 ) Cost of Labor (618 ) (6 ) (6 ) 97 (533 ) Occupancy and Other (742 ) (6 ) (9 ) 122 (635 ) Restaurant Profit $ 263 $ 3 $ 3 $ (40 ) $ 229 Restaurant Margin 11.1 % 11.1 % 2008 vs. 2007 Income / (Expense) 2007 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2008 Company Sales $ 2,507 $ (75 ) $ (10 ) $ (47 ) $ 2,375 Cost of Sales (751 ) 17 (29 ) 11 (752 ) Cost of Labor (655 ) 25 (1 ) 13 (618 ) Occupancy and Other (794 ) 27 3 22 (742 ) Restaurant Profit $ 307 $ (6 ) $ (37 ) $ (1 ) $ 263 Restaurant Margin 12.3 % 11.1 % In 2009, the increase in YRI Company Sales and Restaurant Profit associated with store portfolio actions was driven by new unit development partially offset by refranchising and closures. Significant other factors impacting Company Sales and or Restaurant Profit were Company same store sales growth of 1% due to higher average guest check, commodity inflation, higher labor costs (primarily wage rate and salary increases) and higher occupancy costs. In 2008, the decrease in YRI Company Sales and Restaurant Profit associated with store portfolio actions was driven by refranchising and closures, partially offset by new unit development. Significant other factors impacting Company Sales and or Restaurant Profit were the elimination of a VAT exemption in Mexico with an estimated negative impact of $38 million and $34 million, respectively. An increase in commodity costs was partially offset by higher average guest check.

Significant other factors impacting Company Sales and or Restaurant Profit were Company same store sales declines of 1% and commodity deflation (primarily chicken) of $61 million. In 2008, the increase in China Division Company Sales and Restaurant Profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by the development of new units and the consolidation of a former China unconsolidated affiliate at the beginning of 2008. Significant other factors impacting Company Sales and or Restaurant Profit were Company same store sales growth of 7% and commodity inflation (primarily chicken) of $78 million. 41 Franchise and license fees and income Amount % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) excluding foreign currency translation 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2009 2008 U.S. $ 735 $ 722 $ 684 2 5 N/A N/A YRI 660 669 582 (1 ) 15 7 14 China Division 60 70 69 (15 ) 2 (16 ) (6 ) Unallocated (32 ) N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 1,423 $ 1,461 $ 1,335 (3 ) 9 1 8 Worldwide Franchise and license fees and income for 2009 included a reduction of $32 million as a result of our reimbursements to KFC franchisees for installation costs for the national launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken that has not been allocated to the U.S. segment for performance reporting purposes. U.S. Franchise and license fees and income for 2009 and 2008 was positively impacted by 5% and 2%, respectively, due to the impact of refranchising. China Division Franchise and license fees and income for 2009 and 2008 was negatively impacted by 17% and 19%, respectively, related to the consolidation of two former China unconsolidated affiliates.

In 2008, the decrease in U.S. G&A expenses was driven by refranchising company stores. The increase in Unallocated G&A expense was driven by approximately $49 million of charges associated with G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources related to the U.S. business transformation measures. The increase in YRI G&A expenses for 2009, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was driven by increased costs in strategic growth markets, primarily driven by increased headcount. In 2008, the decrease in YRI G&A expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was driven by a reduction in convention and training expenses, as well as legal fees. The increases in China Division G&A expenses for 2009 and 2008, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, were driven by increased compensation costs resulting from higher headcount in mainland China. Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses increased 19% in 2009. The increase was driven by quality control initiatives, increased provision for U.S. past due receivables (primarily at KFC and LJS) and higher international franchise convention costs. Franchise and license expenses increased 67% in 2008. The increase was driven by higher marketing funding on behalf of franchisees, investments in our U.S. brands related to the U.S. business transformation measures and increased provision for past due receivables. 43 Worldwide Other (Income) Expense 2009 2008 2007 Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ (36 ) $ (41 ) $ (51 ) Gain upon consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in China(a) (68 ) Gain upon sale of investment in unconsolidated affiliate(b)(c) (100 ) (6 ) Wrench litigation income(d) (11 ) Foreign exchange net (gain) loss and other (16 ) (3 ) Other (income) expense $ (104 ) $ (157 ) $ (71 ) (a) See Note 5 for further discussion of the consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate.

The increase was driven by the G&A savings from the actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures and improved restaurant operating costs, primarily driven by commodity deflation. These increases were partially offset by same store sales declines. U.S. Operating Profit decreased 6% in 2008. The decrease was driven by higher restaurant operating costs and higher closure and impairment expenses, partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on Restaurant Profit (primarily due to higher average guest check) and Franchise and license fees. The increase in restaurant operating costs was primarily driven by higher commodity costs. YRI Operating Profit decreased 6% in 2009, including an 11% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, YRI Operating Profit increased 5% in 2009. The increase was driven by the impact of franchise net unit development on franchise and license fees partially offset by a $12 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Pizza Hut South Korea market. YRI Operating Profit increased 10% in 2008, including a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and net unit development on Franchise and license fees. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the VAT exemption in Mexico. China Division Operating Profit increased 25% in 2009, including a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of commodity deflation and new unit development, partially offset by higher G&A expenses. China Division Operating Profit increased 28% in 2008, including an 11% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and net unit development on Restaurant Profit. The increase was partially offset by higher restaurant operating costs and higher G&A expenses. Unallocated Franchise and license fees and income for 2009 reflects our reimbursements to KFC franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken that have not been allocated to the U.S. segment for performance reporting purposes. Unallocated and corporate expenses decreased 24% in 2009 due to the current year G&A savings attributable to, and the lapping of costs associated with, the 2008 actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures. 45 Unallocated and corporate expenses increased 26% in 2008 due to costs associated with the U.S. business transformation measures, partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation expenses. Unallocated impairment expense in 2009 includes a $26 million charge related to a goodwill impairment charge related to LJS/A&W U.S. goodwill. Unallocated Other income (expense) in 2009 includes a $68 million gain recognized upon acquisition of additional ownership in, and consolidation of, the entity that operates KFCs in Shanghai, China, and 2008 includes a $100 million gain recognized on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan. See Note 5. Interest Expense, Net 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 212 $ 253 $ 199 Interest income (18 ) (27 ) (33 ) Interest expense, net $ 194 $ 226 $ 166 Interest expense, net decreased $32 million or 14% in 2009. The decrease was driven by a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt and a decrease in borrowings as compared to prior year. Interest expense, net increased $60 million or 36% in 2008. The increase was driven by an increase in borrowings in 2008 compared to 2007, partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt. Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 Reported Income taxes $ 313 $ 319 $ 282 Effective tax rate 22.4 % 24.7 % 23.7 % 46 The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2009 2008 2007 U.S. federal statutory rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 1.0 0.6 1.0 Foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (11.4 ) (14.5 ) (5.7 ) Adjustments to reserves and prior years (0.6 ) 3.5 2.6 Valuation allowance additions (reversals) (0.7 ) 0.6 (9.0 ) Other, net (0.9 ) (0.5 ) (0.2 ) Effective income tax rate 22.4 % 24.7 % 23.7 % Our 2009 effective tax rate was positively impacted by the year over year change in adjustments to reserves and prior years (including certain out of year adjustments that decreased our effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points in 2009). Benefits associated with our foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations decreased versus prior year as a result of withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends and an increase in tax expense for certain foreign markets. These increases were partially offset by lapping a 2008 expense associated with our plan to distribute certain foreign earnings. Our 2009 effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the reversal of foreign valuation allowances associated with certain deferred tax assets that we now believe are more likely than not to be utilized on future tax returns. Additionally, our rate was lower as a result of lapping the 2008 gain on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan. Our 2008 effective income tax rate was negatively impacted versus 2007 by lapping valuation allowance reversals made in the prior year as discussed below. This negative impact was partially offset by the reversal of foreign valuation allowances in the current year associated with certain deferred tax assets that we now believe are more likely than not to be utilized on future tax returns. Additionally, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the year over year change in adjustments to reserves and prior years (including certain out of year adjustments that increased our effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points in 2008). Benefits associated with our foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations positively impacted the effective tax rate as a result of lapping 2007 expenses associated with the distribution of an intercompany dividend and adjustments to our deferred tax balances that resulted from the Mexico tax law change, as further discussed below, as well as a higher percentage of our income being earned outside the U.S. These benefits were partially offset in 2008 by the gain on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan and expense associated with our plan to distribute certain foreign earnings. We also recognized deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by certain tax planning strategies implemented in 2008 included in foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations (1.7 percentage point impact). However, we provided a full valuation allowance on these assets as we do not believe it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future. Our 2007 effective income tax rate was positively impacted by valuation allowance reversals. In December 2007, the Company finalized various tax planning strategies based on completing a review of our international operations, distributed a $275 million intercompany dividend and sold our interest in our Japan unconsolidated affiliate. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we reversed approximately $82 million of valuation allowances associated with foreign tax credit carryovers that are more likely than not to be claimed on future tax returns. In 2007, benefits associated with our foreign and U.S. tax effects attributable to foreign operations were negatively impacted by $36 million of expense associated with the $275 million intercompany dividend and approximately $20 million of expense for adjustments to our deferred tax balances as a result of the Mexico tax law change enacted during the fourth quarter of 2007. 47 Adjustments to reserves and prior years include the effects of the reconciliation of income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves, including interest thereon, established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,404 million compared to $1,521 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by higher pension contributions, partially offset by higher net income. In 2008, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,521 million compared to $1,551 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest payments and pension contributions. Net cash used in investing activities was $727 million versus $641 million in 2008. The increase was driven by the acquisition of an interest in Little Sheep, as discussed in Note 5, lower proceeds from refranchising and sales of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by lower capital spending. In 2008, net cash used in investing activities was $641 million versus $416 million in 2007. The increase was driven by higher capital spending in 2008 and the lapping of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the Japan unconsolidated affiliate in 2007, partially offset by the year over year change in proceeds from refranchising of restaurants. In December 2007, we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan for $128 million (includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in December 2007). The international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close. Thus, consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period, the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of $100 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008. However, the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the U.S. in December 2007 and were thus reported on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 29, 2007. Net cash used in financing activities was $542 million versus $1,459 million in 2008. The decrease was driven by a reduction in share repurchases, partially offset by net payments on debt. In 2008, net cash used in financing activities was $1,459 million versus $678 million in 2007. The increase was driven by lower net borrowings, higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments in 2008. Consolidated Financial Condition The acquisition of additional ownership in, and consolidation of, a former unconsolidated affiliate that operates the KFCs in Shanghai, China during 2009 impacted our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 26, 2009. See Note 5 for a discussion of this transaction and a summary of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the acquisition and consolidation. 48 Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited YUM investment. In each of the last eight fiscal years, net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1.1 billion. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. However, unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized. In the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns, we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Additionally, as of December, 2009 we had approximately $1.3 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in 2012, primarily related to a domestic facility. Our China Division and YRI represent more than 60% of the Companys operating profit and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development. To the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our U.S. discretionary cash spending, including share repurchases, dividends and debt repayments, we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner. As a result of our substantial international development a significant amount of non cash undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries is considered indefinitely reinvested as of December 26, 2009. If we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our U.S. business or are unable to refinance future U.S. debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced. We are currently managing our cash and debt positions in order to maintain our current investment grade ratings from Standard & Poors Rating Services (BBB ) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa3). As a commitment to maintaining our investment grade rating we improved our capital structure by extending our scheduled debt maturities while reducing our debt outstanding during 2009. Additionally, we funded $280 million of our unfunded pension obligation and did not repurchase shares of our Common Stock. Subsequent to year end, we have resumed repurchasing shares of our Common Stock. However we believe we can do so while maintaining a capital structure that allows us to remain an investment grade borrower. While we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating, a downgrade would increase the Companys current borrowing costs and could impact the Companys ability to access the credit markets if necessary. Based on the amount and composition of our debt at December 26, 2009, which included a minimal amount outstanding under our credit facilities, our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings. Discretionary Spending During 2009, we invested $797 million in our businesses, including approximately $275 million in the U.S., $232 million for the International Division and $290 million for the China Division. For 2010, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $1 billion. During the year ended December 26, 2009, we paid cash dividends of $362 million. Additionally, on November 20, 2009 our Board of Directors approved cash dividends of $0.21 per share of Common Stock to be distributed on February 5, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 15, 2010. The Company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35% 40% of net income. The Company did not repurchase shares of our Common Stock during 2009. As of December 26, 2009, we have $300 million (excluding applicable transaction fees) available for future repurchases under a share repurchase authorization that expires in September 2010. 49 Borrowing Capacity Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.15 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which matures in November 2012 and includes 23 participating banks with commitments ranging from $20 million to $113 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or bankers acceptances, where applicable. At December 26, 2009, our unused Credit Facility totaled $975 million net of outstanding letters of credit of $170 million. There were borrowings of $5 million outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 26, 2009. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.25% to 1.25% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or is determined by an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. We also have a $350 million, syndicated revolving credit facility (the International Credit Facility, or ICF) which matures in November 2012 and includes 6 banks with commitments ranging from $35 million to $90 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. There was available credit of $350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2009. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.31% to 1.50% over LIBOR or is determined by a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branchs publicly announced reference rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUMs performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly. The Credit Facility and the ICF are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, the ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM. These agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. Given the Companys balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at December 26, 2009 with a considerable amount of cushion. The majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes with varying maturity dates from 2011 through 2037 and stated interest rates ranging from 4.25% to 8.88%. The Senior Unsecured Notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes, reflecting the events described below, were $2.9 billion at December 26, 2009. During the second quarter of 2009 we repurchased Senior Unsecured Notes due July 1, 2012 with an aggregate principal amount of $137 million. In August 2009, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Senior Unsecured Notes that are due in September 2015 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.30% Senior Unsecured Notes that are due in September 2019. We used the proceeds from our issuance of these Senior Unsecured Notes to repay a variable rate senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $375 million that was scheduled to mature in 2011 and to make discretionary payments to our pension plans in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our Senior Unsecured Notes, Credit Facility, and ICF all contain cross default provisions, whereby a default under any of these agreements constitutes a default under each of the other agreements. 50 Contractual Obligations In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, our significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 26, 2009 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt obligations(a) $ 4,844 $ 178 $ 1,207 $ 258 $ 3,201 Capital leases(b) 409 67 51 48 243 Operating leases(b) 4,675 535 938 778 2,424 Purchase obligations(c) 737 551 173 11 2 Other(d) 50 22 11 7 10 Total contractual obligations $ 10,715 $ 1,353 $ 2,380 $ 1,102 $ 5,880 (a) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments. Rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on the LIBOR forward yield curve. Excludes a fair value adjustment of $36 million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 11. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to nearly 6,200 restaurants. See Note 12. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements. (d) Other consists of 2010 pension plan funding obligations, the current portion of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and projected payments for deferred compensation. We have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $264 million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. These liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow. We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees, the most significant of which are in the U.S. and U.K. The most significant of these plans, the YUM Retirement Plan (the Plan), is funded while benefits from the other U.S. plans are paid by the Company as incurred. Our funding policy for the Plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the Plans funded status. At December 26, 2009, the Plan was in a net underfunded position of $83 million. Based on the current funding status of the Plan, we will not be required to make minimum contributions in 2010. Investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption. Future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions beyond 2010. 51 The U.K. pension plans are in a net underfunded position of $29 million at our 2009 measurement date. We have committed to making discretionary funding contributions of $15 million to one of these plans in 2010 and this amount is included in our contractual obligations table above. Our post retirement plan in the U.S. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made post retirement benefit payments of $6 million in 2009 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table. See Note 15 for further details about our pension and post retirement plans. We have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured, including workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) and employee healthcare and long term disability claims. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare, long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have provided a partial guarantee of approximately $15 million of a franchisee loan program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and, to a lesser extent, in connection with the Companys historical refranchising programs at December 26, 2009. We have also provided two letters of credit totaling approximately $23 million in support of the franchisee loan program. One such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee. The other letter of credit could be used, in certain circumstances, to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program. The total loans outstanding under the loan pool were $54 million at December 26, 2009. Our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately $40 million and $50 million of debt outstanding as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the levels within the fair value hierarchy. Separate disclosures are required for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements, and the reasons for the transfers must be disclosed. In the reconciliation for Level 3 fair value measurements, separate disclosures are required for purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to materially impact the Company. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on transfers and servicing of financial assets, requiring more information about transfers of financial assets, eliminating the qualifying special purpose entity concept, changing the requirements for derecognizing financial assets and requiring additional disclosures. The FASB also issued guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity, that modifies the methods allowed for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires enhanced disclosures related to an enterprises involvement in a variable interest entity. The adoption of this guidance may require the Company to consolidate an entity that provides loans used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and, to a lesser extent, in connection with the Companys historical refranchising programs. If consolidation of this entity is required, the Companys long term debt will increase by approximately $54 million with a corresponding increase to receivables. See Note 21 for additional information regarding this franchisee loan program. This guidance is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, our fiscal 2010. 52 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We review our long lived assets of restaurants (primarily PP&E and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) that are currently operating and have not been offered for refranchise semi annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability based on the restaurants forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. For restaurant assets that are not deemed to be recoverable, we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the after tax cash flows and discount rate. The after tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. We perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if there is an expectation that we will refranchise the restaurants as a group. These impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale. Expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after tax cash flows for the restaurant or group of restaurants. The after tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets. Historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. The discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long lived assets. The discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. We have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant, such as the LJS and A&W trademark/brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights, which are amortized over their expected useful lives. We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept. We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate. These definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted after tax cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the assets future remaining life. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property, plant and equipment. 53 Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S. and our business units internationally (typically individual countries). Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after tax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties. Future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. The assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. We believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. Except for the LJS/A&W U.S. and Pizza Hut South Korea reporting units discussed below, the fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value as of the 2009 goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. YUM recorded goodwill impairment charges of $26 million and $12 million for our LJS/A&W U.S. and Pizza Hut South Korea reporting units, respectively, as the carrying value of these reporting units exceeded their fair values. The fair value of the LJS/A&W U.S. reporting unit was based on our discounted expected after tax cash flows from the future royalty stream, net of G&A, expected to be earned from the underlying franchise agreements. These cash flows incorporated a decline in future profit expectations for our LJS/A&W U.S. reporting unit, which were due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding as a long term U.S. growth strategy. The fair value of the Pizza Hut South Korea reporting unit was based on the discounted expected after tax future cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties for this reporting unit. Our expectations of after tax cash flows for this business were negatively impacted by recent profit declines for this reporting unit. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill. 54 Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/Guarantees Franchise and license receivable balances include royalties, initial fees as well as other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services. Our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon pre defined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. This methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at December 26, 2009. As such, we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at December 26, 2009. We have historically issued certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1) assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants, 2) facilitating franchisee development and 3) equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees. We recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification, such as renewals, when we remain contingently liable. The fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties. The potential total exposure for lease assignments is significant when aggregated, with approximately $425 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 26, 2009. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. Additionally, we have guaranteed approximately $40 million of franchisee loans of various equipment programs. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under assigned leases and certain of the equipment loan programs. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and, historically, we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees. If payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees. At December 26, 2009, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable. If we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. See Note 21 for a further discussion of our guarantees. Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 21 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. 55 Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans are in the U.S. We have recorded the under funded status of $175 million for these U.S. plans as a pension liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 26, 2009. These U.S. plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $1,010 million and a fair value of plan assets of $835 million at December 26, 2009. The PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. For our U.S. plans, we measured our PBO using a discount rate of 6.3% at December 26, 2009. This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary. The primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated Aa or higher by Moodys with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. We excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by Moodys for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year. The weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $73 million at our measurement date. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $84 million at our measurement date. The pension expense we will record in 2010 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date. We expect pension expense for our U.S. plans to increase approximately $2 million to $41 million in 2010. The increase is primarily driven by increases in amortization of net loss and interest costs, partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets due to increases in the plan assets balance during 2009. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2010 U.S. pension expense by approximately $13 million. The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our estimated long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions. Our expected long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2010 pension expense, at December 26, 2009 was 7.75%. We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our 2010 U.S. pension plan expense by approximately $9 million. The losses our U.S. plan assets have experienced, along with a decrease in discount rates over time, have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax net loss of $346 million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the U.S. plans at December 26, 2009. For purposes of determining 2009 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $13 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost. We will recognize approximately $23 million of such loss in 2010. See Note 15 for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans. 56 Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Expense Compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated on the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 16. Additionally, we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions. We have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures. These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the RGM Plan) and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans. Historically, approximately 10% 15% of total options and SARs granted have been made under the RGM Plan. Grants under the RGM Plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25% per year over four years. We use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule. We reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis. Based on the results of this analysis, we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives, respectively. Upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options. We have estimated forfeitures based on historical data. Based on such data, we believe that approximately 50% of all awards granted under the RGM Plan will be forfeited and approximately 25% of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited. Income Taxes At December 26, 2009, we had a valuation allowance of $187 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of $230 million, as well as our other deferred tax assets, to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage, including approximately $110 million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our Income tax provision when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 26, 2009, we had $301 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $259 million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We evaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. Additionally, we have not recorded the deferred tax impact for certain undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries totaling approximately $875 million at December 26, 2009, as we believe these amounts are indefinitely reinvested. If our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances, deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact income taxes. See Note 19 for a further discussion of our income taxes. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the U.S. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $3 million and $9 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 would decrease approximately $20 million and $27 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 would decrease approximately $181 million and $120 million, respectively. Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The combined International Division and China Division Operating Profits constitute more than 60% of our Operating Profit in 2009, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $2.6 billion as of December 26, 2009. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows. For the fiscal year ended December 26, 2009, Operating Profit would have decreased approximately $120 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors. 58
