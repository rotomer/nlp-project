Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction and Overview The following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 61 through 66 (Financial Statements) and the Forward Looking Statements on page 2 and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. Throughout the MD&A, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM or the Company) makes reference to certain performance measures as described below. The Company provides the percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation (FX or Forex). These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations. System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development. Same store sales is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more. Company restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company restaurants in generating Company sales. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as Company restaurant profit divided by Company sales. Operating margin is defined as Operating Profit divided by Total revenue. All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements on pages 67 through 124. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. Description of Business YUM is the worlds largest restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with over 37,000 restaurants in more than 110 countries and territories operating under the KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers or A&W All American Food Restaurants brands. Four of the Companys restaurant brands KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Long John Silvers are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza, Mexican style food and quick service seafood categories, respectively. Of the over 37,000 restaurants, 19% are operated by the Company, 75% are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 6% are operated by licensees. YUMs business consists of three reporting segments: United States, YUM Restaurants International (YRI or International Division) and the China Division. The China Division includes only mainland China (China) and YRI includes the remainder of our international operations. The China Division, YRI and Taco Bell U.S. now represent over 85% of the Companys operating profits, excluding Corporate and unallocated income and expenses. 25 Segment Reporting Change At the beginning of 2010 we began reporting information for our Thailand and KFC Taiwan businesses within our International Division as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. These businesses now report to the President of YRI, whereas previously they reported to the President of our China Division. While this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results, segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation. The following table summarizes the 2009 and 2008 increases to selected line items within the YRI segment as a result of these segment reporting changes (with equal and offsetting decreases impacting the China Division): 2009 2008 Company sales $ 270 $ 282 Company restaurant expenses 244 254 Operating Profit 6 9 Strategies The Company continues to focus on four key strategies: Build Leading Brands in China in Every Significant Category The Company has developed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants, respectively, in mainland China. Additionally, the Company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland China which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage. Given this strong competitive position, a growing economy and a population of 1.3 billion in mainland China, the Company is rapidly adding KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of Pizza Hut Home Service (pizza delivery) and East Dawning (Chinese food). Our ongoing earnings growth model in China includes double digit unit growth, same store sales growth of at least 4% and leverage of our General and Administrative (G&A) infrastructure, which we expect to drive Operating Profit growth of 15%. Drive Aggressive International Expansion and Build Strong Brands Everywhere The Company and its franchisees opened nearly 900 new restaurants in 2010 in the Companys International Division, representing 11 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants, and YRI is one of the leading international retail developers in terms of units opened. The Company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including France, Russia and India. The International Divisions Operating Profit has experienced an 8 year compound annual growth rate of 11%. Our ongoing earnings growth model for YRI includes Operating Profit growth of 10% driven by 3 4% net unit growth, at least 2 3% same store sales growth, modest margin improvement and leve rage of our G&A infrastructure. Dramatically Improve U.S. Brand Positions, Consistency and Returns The Company continues to focus on improving its U.S. position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience. The Company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts. We continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on Company owned restaurants. Our ongoing earnings growth model calls for Operating Profit growth of 5% in the U.S. As we near completion of our refranchising program in 2011, the Taco Bell operating segment will become an increasingly larger component of U.S. ongoing earnings growth. The U.S. ongoing earnings growth model includes Taco Bell Oper ating Profit growth of 6% driven by modest unit growth, same store sales growth of 3% and leverage of our G&A infrastructure. 26 Drive Industry Leading, Long Term Shareholder and Franchisee Value The Company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The Company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry. The Companys dividend and share repurchase programs have returned over $1.6 billion and $6 billion to shareholders, respectively, since 2004. The Company is targeting an annual dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40% of net income and has increased the quarterly dividend each year since inception in 2004. Shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions. The ongoing earnings growth rates referenced above represent our average annual expectations for the foreseeable future. Details of our 2011 Guidance by division as presented on December 8, 2010 can be found online at http://www.yum.com. 27 2010 Highlights Worldwide system sales grew 4%, prior to foreign currency translation, including 17% in China, 4% in YRI and 2% in the U.S. Same store sales grew 6% in China and 1% in the U.S. Same store sales were flat in YRI. International development continued at a strong pace with 1,391 new restaurants including 507 new units in China and 884 new units in YRI. Worldwide restaurant margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 17.0% including improvement in China, YRI, and the U.S. Worldwide operating profit grew 15%, prior to foreign currency translation, including 26% in China, 11% in YRI, and 3% in the U.S. Increased the quarterly dividend by 19% in the third quarter and repurchased 9.8 million shares totaling $390 million at an average price of $40 over the course of the year. All preceding comparisons are versus the same period a year ago and exclude the impact of Special Items.

Significant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results Special Items In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) above and throughout this document, the Company has provided non GAAP measurements which present operating results in 2010, 2009 and 2008 on a basis before Special Items. Included in Special Items are the impact of measures we took to transform our U.S. business (the U.S. business transformation measures) including: the U.S. refranchising gain (loss), the depreciation reduction arising from the impairment of KFC restaurants we offered to sell in 2010, charges relating to U.S. G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, investments in our U.S. Brands and a 2009 U.S. Goodwill impairment charge. Special items also include losses recognized in 2010 and 2009 as a res ult of our decision to refranchise our equity markets in Mexico and Taiwan, the 2009 gain upon our acquisition of additional ownership in, and consolidation of, the operating entity that owns the KFCs in Shanghai, China, and the 2008 gain on the sale of our minority interest in our Japan unconsolidated affiliate. These amounts are further described below. 29 The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and Special Items are not included in our China Division, YRI or U.S. segment results. This non GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2010, 2009 and 2008 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and or nature.

We do not believe these measures are indicative of our ongoing operations and are not including the impacts of these U.S. business transformation measures in our U.S. segment for performance reporting purposes. In the years ended December 25, 2010 and December 27, 2008, we recorded pre tax losses of $18 million and $5 million from refranchising in the U.S., respectively. In the year ended December 26, 2009, we recorded a pre tax refranchising gain of $34 million in the U.S. The loss recorded in the year ended December 25, 2010 is the net result of gains from 404 restaurants sold and non cash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the U.S., principally a substantial portion of our Company operated KFC restaurants. The non cash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise a substantial portion of our Company operated KFC restaurants in the U.S., which were mostly recorded in the first quarter of 2010, decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by $9 million in the year ended December 25, 2010. This depreciation reduction was recorded as a Special Item, resulting in depreciation expense in the U.S. segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charge being recorded for these restaurants. The refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in Note 4 and the Store Portfolio Strategy Section of the MD&A. In connection with our G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources (primarily severance and early retirement costs) we recorded pre tax charges of $9 million, $16 million and $49 million in the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively. We realized a $65 million decline in our U.S. G&A expenses in the year ended December 26, 2009 driven by the U.S. productivity initiatives and realignment of resource measures we took in 2008 and 2009. As a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our LJS and A&W U.S. businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding, we recorded a non cash charge of $26 million in Closures and impairment expenses, which resulted in no related income tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2009 to write off goodwill associated with these businesses. Additionally, the Company recognized a reduction to Franchise and license fees and income of $32 million, pre tax, in the year ended December 26, 2009, related to investments in our U.S. Brands. These investments reflect our reimbursements to KFC franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. The reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to Franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship. In the year ended December 27, 2008, the Company recognized pre tax expense of $7 million related to investments in our U.S. Brands in Franchise and license expenses. 31 Refranchising of Equity Markets Outside the U.S. In the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a $52 million loss on the refranchising of our Mexico equity market as we sold all of our company operated restaurants, comprised of 222 KFCs and 123 Pizza Huts, to an existing Latin American franchise partner. The buyer will also serve as the master franchisee for Mexico which had 102 KFCs and 53 Pizza Hut franchise restaurants at the time of the transaction. The write off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our Mexico reporting unit includes an insignificant amount of goodwill. This loss did not result in any related income tax benefit and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. During the year ended December 26, 2009 we recognized a non cash $10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our KFC Taiwan equity market. During the year ended December 25, 2010 we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in Taiwan, which consisted of 124 KFCs. We included in our December 25, 2010 financial statements a non cash write off of $7 million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of Taiwan. Neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit, and neither loss was allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. The amount of goodwill write off was based on the relative fair values of the Taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained. The fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee will pay the Company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. The fair value of the Taiwan business retained consists of expected, net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees, including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. We believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the Taiwan refranchising are substantially consistent with market. The remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our Taiwan business of $30 million, after the aforementioned write off, was determined not to be impaired as the fair value of the Taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. Consolidation of a Former Unconsolidated Affiliate in Shanghai, China On May 4, 2009 we acquired an additional 7% ownership in the entity that operates more than 200 KFCs in Shanghai, China for $12 million, increasing our ownership to 58%. Prior to our acquisition of this additional interest, this entity was accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting. Concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition. As required by GAAP, we remeasured our previously held 51% ownership in the entity, which had a recorded value of $17 million at the date of acquisition at fair value and recognized a gain of $68 million accordingly. This gain, which resulted in no related income tax expense, was recorded in Other (income) expense in our C onsolidated Statements of Income in 2009 and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. 32 Under the equity method of accounting, we previously reported our 51% share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate (after interest expense and income taxes) as Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate. Subsequent to the date of the acquisition, we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statements of Income. We no longer recorded franchise fee income for these restaurants nor did we report Other (income) expense as we did under the equity method of accounting. Net income attributable to our partners ownership percentage is recorded as Net Income noncontrolling interest within our Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 25, 2010 the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased Company sales by $98 million, decreased Franchise and license fees and income by $6 million and positively impacted Operating Profit by $3 million. For the year ended December 26, 2009 the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased Company sales by $192 million; decreased Franchise and license fees and income by $12 million and positively impacted Operating Profit by $4 million. The impact on Net Income YUM! Brands, Inc. was not significant to the years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009. Sale of our Interest in our Unconsolidated Affiliate in Japan During the year ended December 27, 2008 we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan (See Note 4 for further discussion of this transaction). This gain was recorded in Other (income) expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes. Russia Acquisition On July 1, 2010, we completed the exercise of our option with our Russian partner to purchase their interest in the co branded Rostiks KFC restaurants across Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. As a result, we acquired company ownership of 50 restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of 81 restaurants, which our partner previously managed as master franchisee. Upon exercise of our option, we paid cash of $56 million, net of settlement of a long term note receivable of $11 million, and assumed long term debt of $10 million. The remaining balance of the purchase price, anticipated to be $11 million, will be paid in cash in July 2012. As a result of our preliminary purchase price allocation for this acquisition, our Consolidated Balance She et includes $36 million of goodwill and $36 million of identifiable intangibles at December 25, 2010. The impact of consolidating this business on all line items within our Consolidated Statement of Income was insignificant for the year ended December 25, 2010. Pizza Hut South Korea Goodwill Impairment As a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our Pizza Hut South Korea market we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $12 million for this market during 2009. This charge was recorded in Closure and impairment (income) expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was allocated to our International Division for performance reporting purposes. Store Portfolio Strategy From time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of strategic U.S. and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital. In the U.S., we are targeting Company ownership of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants of about 12%, down from its current level of 15%. This U.S. target ownership percentage no longer considers the impact of LJS and A&W restaurants, both of which are completely franchise operated, as we are pursuing a sale of these brands. Consistent with this strategy, 404, 541 and 700 Company restaurants in the U.S. were sold to franchisees in the years e nded December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively, and at December 25, 2010 we have offered for refranchising approximately 550 KFCs in the U.S. During 2010, we also executed refranchising of all Company owned KFCs and Pizza Huts in Mexico (345 restaurants) and KFCs in Taiwan (124 restaurants). 33 Refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. Additionally, G&A expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities. The timing of G&A declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals. G&A expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct G&A that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year. The following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities: 2010 2009 2008 Number of units refranchised 949 613 775 Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $ 265 $ 194 $ 266 Refranchising (gain) loss, pre tax $ 63 $ (26 ) $ (5 ) The impact on Operating Profit arising from refranchising is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and G&A expenses and (b) the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised. The tables presented below reflect the impacts on Total revenues and on Operating Profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year. In these tables, Decreased Company sales and Decreased Restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year. Increased Fr anchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the Company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were Company stores in the prior year. 34 The following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on Total revenues as described above: 2010 China Division YRI U.S. Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (20 ) $ (183 ) $ (401 ) $ (604 ) Increased Franchise and license fees and income 3 9 25 37 Decrease in Total revenues $ (17 ) $ (174 ) $ (376 ) $ (567 ) 2009 China Division YRI U.S. Worldwide Decreased Company sales $ (5 ) $ (77 ) $ (640 ) $ (722 ) Increased Franchise and license fees and income 5 36 41 Decrease in Total revenues $ (5 ) $ (72 ) $ (604 ) $ (681 ) The following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on Operating Profit as described above: 2010 China Division YRI U.S. Worldwide Decreased Restaurant profit $ (3 ) $ (5 ) $ (44 ) $ (52 ) Increased Franchise and license fees and income 3 9 25 37 Decreased G&A 9 6 15 Increase (decrease) in Operating Profit $ $ 13 $ (13 ) $ 2009 China Division YRI U.S. Worldwide Decreased Restaurant profit $ (1 ) $ (2 ) $ (63 ) $ (66 ) Increased Franchise and license fees and income 5 36 41 Decreased G&A 14 14 Increase (decrease) in Operating Profit $ (1 ) $ 3 $ (13 ) $ (11 ) 35 Internal Revenue Service Proposed Adjustment On June 23, 2010, the Company received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) relating to its examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. The IRS has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the U.S. that Yum transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The proposed adjustment would result in approximately $700 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately $150 million. Furthermore, if the IRS prevails it is likely to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal 2006. The potential additional taxes for these later years, through 2010, computed on a similar basis to the 2004 2006 additional taxes, would be approximately $320 million plus net interest to date of approximately $20 million. We believe that the Company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustment is inconsistent with applicable income tax laws, Treasury Regulations and relevant case law. We intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the IRS. As the final resolution of the proposed adjustment remains uncertain, the Company will continue to provide for its position in this matter based on the tax benefit that we believe is the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement of this issue. There can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.&#160 ; Additionally, if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue, such increases could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded. The Company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution. Taco Bell Beef Issue In late January 2011 a lawsuit was filed alleging a violation of consumer protection statutes and deceptive business practices by Taco Bell through its advertising that the beef served in its products is seasoned beef. Though the Company denies all claims within the lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position, the resulting negative publicity regarding its food quality has adversely impacted Taco Bell sales in both company and franchise stores. While we do not anticipate a sustained negative impact on Taco Bells sales, it is difficult for us to predict if there will be any significant impact on our 2011 Revenues and Operating Profit given the recent nature of the adverse publicity. Sale of Long John Silvers and A&W Subsequent to the end of our fourth quarter, we decided to place our Long John Silvers and A&W All American Food Restaurants brands for sale and began the process to identify a buyer. In the first quarter of 2011, we anticipate that we will recognize a non cash pre tax impairment loss in Special Items as a result of our decision to sell. The amount of the expected pre tax loss as well as the related tax impact will be dependent upon indications we receive as to potential sales prices and structures. We do not expect the eventual sale to have a material impact to our ongoing earnings or cash flows. 36 Restaurant Unit Activity Worldwide Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees(a) Balance at end of 2008 7,568 645 25,911 34,124 New Builds 595 70 1,068 1,733 Acquisitions 57 (57 ) Refranchising (613 ) 612 (1 ) Closures (178 ) (10 ) (756 ) (944 ) Other 237 (236 ) (33 ) (32 ) Balance at end of 2009 7,666 469 26,745 34,880 New Builds 607 62 952 1,621 Acquisitions 110 (110 ) Refranchising (949 ) 949 Closures (163 ) (6 ) (668 ) (837 ) Other (16 ) (16 ) Balance at end of 2010 7,271 525 27,852 35,648 % of Total 21% 1% 78% 100% China Division (c) Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees(a) Balance at end of 2008 2,272 645 96 3,013 New Builds 427 70 12 509 Acquisitions Refranchising (11 ) 11 Closures (59 ) (10 ) (1 ) (70 ) Other (b) 237 (236 ) 1 Balance at end of 2009 2,866 469 118 3,453 New Builds 442 62 3 507 Acquisitions Refranchising (33 ) 33 Closures (47 ) (6 ) (1 ) (54 ) Other Balance at end of 2010 3,228 525 153 3,906 % of Total 83% 13% 4% 100% 37 YRI (c) Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees(a) Balance at end of 2008 1,982 11,333 13,315 New Builds 123 835 958 Acquisitions 15 (15 ) Refranchising (61 ) 61 Closures (59 ) (401 ) (460 ) Other (5 ) (5 ) Balance at end of 2009 2,000 11,808 13,808 New Builds 83 801 884 Acquisitions 53 (53 ) Refranchising (512 ) 512 Closures (65 ) (346 ) (411 ) Other Balance at end of 2010 1,559 12,722 14,281 % of Total 11% 89% 100% United States Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Franchisees Total Excluding Licensees(a) Balance at end of 2008 3,314 14,482 17,796 New Builds 45 221 266 Acquisitions 42 (42 ) Refranchising (541 ) 540 (1 ) Closures (60 ) (354 ) (414 ) Other (28 ) (28 ) Balance at end of 2009 2,800 14,819 17,619 New Builds 82 148 230 Acquisitions 57 (57 ) Refranchising (404 ) 404 Closures (51 ) (321 ) (372 ) Other (16 ) (16 ) Balance at end of 2010 2,484 14,977 17,461 % of Total 14% 86% 100% (a) The Worldwide, YRI and U.S. totals exclude 2,187, 131 and 2,056 licensed units, respectively, at December 25, 2010. There are no licensed units in the China Division. As licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units, we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information. (b) During the second quarter of 2009 we acquired additional ownership in and began consolidating an entity that operates the KFC business in Shanghai, China and have reclassified the units accordingly. This entity was previously accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate. (c) The ending balances for 2008 and the activity for 2009 for the International Division and China Division have been restated to reflect a change in our management reporting structure. The International Division ending balances for 2008 and 2009 now include 393 and 444 Company units, respectively and 176 and 158 Franchisee units, respectively, in Thailand and KFC Taiwan with the offset to the China Division ending balances. 38 Multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count. System Sales Growth The following tables detail the key drivers of system sales growth for each reportable segment by year. Net unit growth represents the net impact of actual system sales growth due to new unit openings and historical system sales lost due to closures as well as any necessary rounding. 2010 vs. 2009 China Division YRI U.S. Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) 6 % % 1 % 2 % Net unit growth and other 11 4 1 2 Foreign currency translation 1 6 N/A 3 % Change 18 % 10 % 2 % 7 % % Change, excluding forex 17 % 4 % N/A 4 % 2009 vs. 2008 China Division YRI U.S. Worldwide Same store sales growth (decline) (1) % 1 % (5) % (2) % Net unit growth and other 11 4 1 3 Foreign currency translation 1 (9) N/A (3) % Change 11 % (4) % (4) % (2) % % Change, excluding forex 10 % 5 % N/A 1 % 39 Company Operated Store Results The following tables detail the key drivers of the year over year changes of Company sales and Restaurant profit. Store portfolio actions represent the net impact of new unit openings, acquisitions, refranchisings and store closures on Company sales or Restaurant profit. The impact of new unit openings and acquisitions represent the actual Company sales or Restaurant profit for the periods the Company operated the restaurants in the current year but did not operate them in the prior year. The impact of refranchisings and store closures represent the actual Company sales or Restaurant profit for the periods in the prior year while the Company operated the restaurants but did not operate them in the current year. The dollar changes in Company Restaurant profit by year were as follows: China Division 2010 vs. 2009 Income / (Expense) 2009 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2010 Company sales $ 3,352 $ 484 $ 207 $ 38 $ 4,081 Cost of sales (1,175 ) (162 ) (12 ) (13 ) (1,362 ) Cost of labor (447 ) (78 ) (56 ) (6 ) (587 ) Occupancy and other (1,025 ) (160 ) (35 ) (11 ) (1,231 ) Restaurant profit $ 705 $ 84 $ 104 $ 8 $ 901 Restaurant margin 21.0 % 22.1 % 2009 vs. 2008 Income / (Expense) 2008 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2009 Company sales $ 2,776 $ 532 $ (10 ) $ 54 $ 3,352 Cost of sales (1,049 ) (193 ) 86 (19 ) (1,175 ) Cost of labor (364 ) (79 ) 3 (7 ) (447 ) Occupancy and other (827 ) (190 ) 8 (16 ) (1,025 ) Restaurant profit $ 536 $ 70 $ 87 $ 12 $ 705 Restaurant margin 19.3 % 21.0 % In 2010, the increase in China Division Company sales and Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by the development of new units and the acquisition of additional interest in and consolidation of a former China unconsolidated affiliate during 2009 (See Note 4 for further discussion). Significant other factors impacting Company sales and or Restaurant profit were Company same store sales growth of 6% and commodity deflation o f $26 million partially offset by labor inflation. Additionally, China Division Restaurant profit benefited $16 million from our brands participation in the World Expo during 2010. This benefit will not occur in 2011. In 2009, the increase in China Division Company sales and Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by the development of new units and the acquisition of additional interest in and consolidation of a former China unconsolidated affiliate during 2009. Commodity deflation (primarily chicken) of $62 million also impacted Restaurant profit. Company same store sales were flat for the year. 40 YRI 2010 vs. 2009 Income / (Expense) 2009 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2010 Company sales $ 2,323 $ (49 ) $ (10 ) $ 83 $ 2,347 Cost of sales (758 ) 19 17 (31 ) (753 ) Cost of labor (586 ) 20 (8 ) (17 ) (591 ) Occupancy and other (724 ) 21 (24 ) (727 ) Restaurant profit $ 255 $ 11 $ (1 ) $ 11 $ 276 Restaurant margin 10.9 % 11.7 % 2009 vs. 2008 Income / (Expense) 2008 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2009 Company sales $ 2,657 $ 42 $ 22 $ (398 ) $ 2,323 Cost of sales (855 ) (17 ) (15 ) 129 (758 ) Cost of labor (677 ) (8 ) (1 ) 100 (586 ) Occupancy and other (834 ) (12 ) (5 ) 127 (724 ) Restaurant profit $ 291 $ 5 $ 1 $ (42 ) $ 255 Restaurant margin 10.9 % 10.9 % In 2010, the decrease in YRI Company sales associated with store portfolio actions was driven by refranchising, primarily KFC Taiwan, partially offset by new unit development. The increase in Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was driven by new unit development partially offset by refranchising. Another significant factor impacting Restaurant profit during the year was labor inflation. Company same store sales were flat for the year. In 2009, the increase in YRI Company sales and Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was driven by new unit development partially offset by refranchising and closures. Significant other factors impacting Company sales and or Restaurant profit were Company same store sales growth of 1% due to higher average guest check and commodity inflation. 41 U.S. 2010 vs. 2009 Income / (Expense) 2009 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2010 Company sales $ 3,738 $ (378 ) $ (5 ) $ N/A $ 3,355 Cost of sales (1,070 ) 103 (9 ) N/A (976 ) Cost of labor (1,121 ) 126 1 N/A (994 ) Occupancy and other (1,028 ) 115 5 N/A (908 ) Restaurant profit $ 519 $ (34 ) $ (8 ) $ N/A $ 477 Restaurant margin 13.9 % 14.2 % 2009 vs. 2008 Income / (Expense) 2008 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2009 Company sales $ 4,410 $ (515 ) $ (157 ) $ N/A $ 3,738 Cost of sales (1,335 ) 158 107 N/A (1,070 ) Cost of labor (1,329 ) 157 51 N/A (1,121 ) Occupancy and other (1,195 ) 154 13 N/A (1,028 ) Restaurant profit $ 551 $ (46 ) $ 14 $ N/A $ 519 Restaurant margin 12.5 % 13.9 % In 2010, the decrease in U.S. Company sales and Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by refranchising. Other significant factors impacting Restaurant profit were a negative impact from sales mix shift partially offset by commodity deflation of $7 million. Company same store sales were flat for the year. In 2009, the decrease in U.S. Company sales and Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by refranchising. Significant other factors impacting Company sales and or Restaurant profit were Company same store sales decline of 4%, commodity deflation of $28 million (primarily cheese), and cost savings associated with productivity initiatives. 42 Franchise and license fees and income Amount % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) excluding foreign currency translation 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 China Division $ 54 $ 55 $ 64 (15 ) (1 ) (16 ) YRI 741 665 675 11 (1 ) 6 7 U.S. 765 735 722 4 2 N/A N/A Unallocated (32 ) NM NM N/A N/A Worldwide $ 1,560 $ 1,423 $ 1,461 10 (3 ) 7 1 China Division Franchise and license fees and income for 2010 and 2009 were negatively impacted by 10% and 19%, respectively, related to the acquisition of additional interest in, and consolidation of, an entity that operated the KFCs in Shanghai, China during 2009. See Note 4. U.S. Franchise and license fees and income for 2010 and 2009 was positively impacted by 3% and 5%, respectively, due to the impact of refranchising. Worldwide Franchise and license fees and income for 2009 included a reduction of $32 million as a result of our reimbursements to KFC franchisees for installation costs for the national launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken that has not been allocated to the U.S. segment for performance reporting purposes. 43 General and Administrative Expenses Amount % Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) excluding foreign currency translation 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 China Division $ 216 $ 188 $ 165 15 13 15 12 YRI 378 362 392 4 (7 ) 1 3 U.S. 492 482 547 2 (12 ) N/A N/A Unallocated 191 189 238 1 (21 ) N/A N/A Worldwide $ 1,277 $ 1,221 $ 1,342 5 (9 ) 3 (6 ) The increase in China Division G&A expenses for 2010 and 2009, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was driven by increased compensation costs resulting from higher headcount and the impact of the consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate during 2009 (See Note 4 for further discussion). The increase in YRI G&A expenses for 2010, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was driven by increased investment in strategic growth markets, including costs related to the Russia acquisition (See Note 4 for further discussion), partially offset by G&A savings from refranchising all of our remaining company restaurants in Taiwan. In 2009, the increase in YRI G&A expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, was driven by increased investment in strategic growth markets. The increase in U.S. G&A expenses for 2010 was driven by increased litigation and incentive compensation costs, partially offset by G&A savings from the actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures and lower project spending. The increase in Unallocated G&A expenses for 2010 was driven by increased litigation and incentive compensation costs, partially offset by G&A savings from the actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures. In 2009, the decreases in U.S. and Unallocated G&A expenses were driven by the impact on G&A from the actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures. Worldwide Franchise and License Expenses Franchise and license expenses decreased 7% in 2010. The decrease was driven by lower provision for U.S. past due receivables (primarily at KFC and Pizza Hut) and lapping 2009 international franchise convention costs. Franchise and license expenses increased 19% in 2009. The increase was driven by quality control initiatives, increased provision for U.S. past due receivables (primarily at KFC and LJS) and higher international franchise convention costs. 44 Worldwide Other (Income) Expense 2010 2009 2008 Equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates $ (42 ) $ (36 ) $ (41 ) Gain upon consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in China(a) (68 ) Gain upon sale of investment in unconsolidated affiliate(b) (100 ) Foreign exchange net (gain) loss and other (1 ) (16 ) Other (income) expense $ (43 ) $ (104 ) $ (157 ) (a) See Note 4 for further discussion of the consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in China.

The increase was driven by the impact of same store sales growth and new unit development, partially offset by higher G&A costs. Operating profit benefited $16 million from our brands participation in the World Expo during 2010. China Division Operating Profit increased 26% in 2009, including a 2%, or $10 million, favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The increase was driven by the impact of commodity deflation and new unit development, partially offset by higher G&A expenses. YRI Operating Profit increased 19% in 2010, including an 8%, or $36 million, favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, YRI Operating Profit increased 11% in 2010. The increase was driven by the impact of new unit development and refranchising. YRI Operating Profit decreased 6% in 2009, including a 10%, or $56 million, unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation, YRI Operating Profit increased 4% in 2009. The increase was driven by the impact of franchise net unit development on franchise and license fees partially offset by a $12 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Pizza Hut South Korea market. U.S. Operating Profit increased 3% in 2010. The increase was driven by lower Closure and impairment costs, partially offset by increased litigation costs. U.S. Operating Profit increased 1% in 2009. The increase was driven by the impact on G&A from the actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures and improved restaurant operating costs, primarily driven by commodity deflation. These increases were partially offset by same store sales declines. Unallocated Franchise and license fees and income for 2009 reflects our reimbursements to KFC franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken that have not been allocated to the U.S. segment for performance reporting purposes. Unallocated and corporate expenses increased 3% in 2010 due to higher litigation and incentive compensation costs, partially offset by G&A savings from the actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures. Unallocated and corporate expenses decreased 24% in 2009 due to the impact on G&A from the actions taken as part of our U.S. business transformation measures. 46 Unallocated impairment expense in 2009 includes a $26 million impairment charge related to LJS/A&W U.S. goodwill. Unallocated Other income (expense) in 2009 includes a $68 million gain upon acquisition of additional ownership in, and consolidation of, the entity that operates KFCs in Shanghai, China, and 2008 includes a $100 million gain recognized on the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan. See Note 4 for further discussion. Unallocated Refranchising gain (loss) in 2010 includes pre tax non cash losses of $89 million related to our efforts to refranchise a substantial portion of our Company operated KFC restaurants in the U.S. and a non cash loss of $52 million related to the sale of our Mexico equity business, offset by U.S. gains for restaurants sold at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. See Note 4 for further discussion. Interest Expense, Net 2010 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 195 $ 212 $ 253 Interest income (20 ) (18 ) (27 ) Interest expense, net $ 175 $ 194 $ 226 Interest expense, net decreased $19 million or 9% in 2010. This decrease was driven by both a decrease in average net borrowings and a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt. Interest expense, net decreased $32 million or 14% in 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt and a decrease in borrowings in 2009 as compared to 2008. Income Taxes The reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2010 2009 2008 U.S. federal statutory rate $ 558 35.0 % $ 489 35.0 % $ 452 35.0 % State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 12 0.7 14 1.0 5 0.6 Statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations (235) (14.7) (159 ) (11.4 ) (187 ) (14.5 ) Adjustments to reserves and prior years 55 3.5 (9 ) (0.6 ) 44 3.5 Change in valuation allowance 22 1.4 (9 ) (0.7 ) 12 0.6 Other, net 4 0.2 (13 ) (0.9 ) (7 ) (0.5 ) Effective income tax rate $ 416 26.1 % $ 313 22.4 % $ 319 24.7 % Statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations. This item includes local taxes, withholding taxes, and shareholder level taxes, net of foreign tax credits. The favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside of the U.S. where tax rates are generally lower than the U.S. rate. In 2010, the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of excess foreign tax credits generated by our intent to repatriate current year foreign earnings. 47 In 2009, the benefit was negatively impacted by withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends that were only partially offset by related foreign tax credits generated during the year. In 2008, the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of deferred tax assets for the net operating losses generated by tax planning actions implemented in 2008 (1.7 percentage points). In addition, the benefit was also favorably impacted by a decrease in tax expense for certain foreign markets. Adjustments to reserves and prior years. This item includes: (1) the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets; and (2) changes in tax reserves, including interest thereon, established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these amounts on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for audit settlements and other events we believe may impact the outcome. The impact of certain effects or changes may offset items reflected in the S tatutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations line. In 2010, this item included a net increase in tax expense driven by the reversal of foreign tax credits for prior years that are not likely to be claimed on future tax returns. In 2009, this item included out of year adjustments which lowered our effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points. In 2008, this item included out of year adjustments which increased our effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points. Change in valuation allowance. This item relates to changes for deferred tax assets generated or utilized during the current year and changes in our judgment regarding the likelihood of using deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year. The impact of certain changes may offset items reflected in the Statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations line. In 2010, the $22 million of net tax expense was driven by $25 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year. This expense was partially offset by a $3 million tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of U.S. state deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year. In 2009, the $9 million net tax benefit was driven by $25 million of benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year. This benefit was partially offset by $16 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year. In 2008, the $12 million net tax expense was primarily due to $42 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year, including a full valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets for net operating losses generated by tax planning actions as we did not believe it was more likely than not that they would be realized in the future. This increase was partially offset by $30 million of benefits primarily resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year. 48 Other. This item primarily includes the impact of permanent differences related to current year earnings and U.S. tax credits. In 2009, this item was positively impacted by a one time pre tax gain of approximately $68 million, with no related income tax expense, recognized on our acquisition of additional interest in, and consolidation of, the entity that operates KFC in Shanghai, China. This was partially offset by a pre tax U.S. goodwill impairment charge of approximately $26 million, with no related income tax benefit. Consolidated Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,968 million compared to $1,404 million in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before special items and decreased pension contributions. In 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,404 million compared to $1,521 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by higher pension contributions, partially offset by higher operating profit before special items. Net cash used in investing activities was $579 million versus $727 million in 2009. The decrease was driven by lapping the 2009 acquisition of an interest in Little Sheep, as discussed in Note 4, and increased proceeds from refranchising, partially offset by the 2010 acquisition of our partners interest in Rostiks KFC. See Note 4 for further discussion. In 2009, net cash used in investing activities was $727 million versus $641 million in 2008. The increase was driven by the acquisition of an interest in Little Sheep, lower proceeds from refranchising and sales of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by lower capital spending. In December 2007, we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in Japan for $128 million (includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in December 2007). The international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close. Thus, consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period, the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of $100 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2008. However, the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the U.S. in December 2007 and were thus reported on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 29, 2007. Net cash used in financing activities was $337 million versus $542 million in 2009. The decrease was driven by higher net borrowings, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases. In 2009, net cash used in financing activities was $542 million versus $1,459 million in 2008. The decrease was driven by a reduction in share repurchases, partially offset by net payments on debt. Consolidated Financial Condition The increase in Short term borrowings was primarily due to the classification of $650 million in Senior Unsecured Notes as Short term borrowings due to the April 2011 maturity date. 49 Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited YUM investment. Net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion in each of the last nine fiscal years, including nearly $2 billion in 2010. We expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. However, unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized. In the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns, we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Additionally, as of December 25, 2010 we had approximately $1.3 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in 2012, primarily related to a domestic facility. During the third quarter of 2010, we issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 3.88% 10 year Senior Unsecured Notes due to the favorable credit markets. As a result of issuing the Senior Unsecured Notes as well as our continued strong cash flows from operating activities, we have cash and cash equivalents at December 25, 2010 that are higher than our historical levels. Our cash equivalents are temporarily invested in short term investment grade securities with maturities of three months or less. We anticipate using a significant amount of these cash and cash equivalents when $650 million in Senior Unsecured Notes come due in April 2011. Our China Division and YRI represented more than 65% of the Companys operating profit in 2010 (excluding Corporate and unallocated income and expenses) and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development. To the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our U.S. discretionary cash spending, including share repurchases, dividends and debt repayments, we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner. As a result of our substantial international development a significant amount of investments in foreign subsidiaries are essentially permanent in duration as of December 25, 2010. If we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our U.S. business or are unable to refinance future U.S. debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced. We currently have investment grade ratings from Standard & Poors Rating Services (BBB ) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa3). While we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating, a downgrade would increase the Companys current borrowing costs and could impact the Companys ability to access the credit markets if necessary. Based on the amount and composition of our debt at December 25, 2010, which included no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings. Discretionary Spending During 2010, we invested $796 million in capital spending, including approximately $265 million in the U.S., $259 million for the International Division and $272 million for the China Division. For 2011, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $900 million. During the year ended December 25, 2010, we repurchased shares for $390 million, which includes the effect of $19 million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the 2010 fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the 2010 fiscal year. In March 2010, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases through March 2011 of up to $300 million (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding Common Stock. At December 25, 2010, we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to approximately $193 million of outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under the March 2010 authorization. Additionally, on January 27, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases through July 2012 of up to $750 million (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding Common Stock. Shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions. 50 During the year ended December 25, 2010, we paid cash dividends of $412 million. Additionally, on November 19, 2010 our Board of Directors approved cash dividends of $0.25 per share of Common Stock to be distributed on February 4, 2011 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 14, 2011. The Company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35% 40% of net income. Borrowing Capacity Our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.15 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which matures in November 2012 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from $10 million to $113 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or bankers acceptances, where applicable. At December 25, 2010, our unused Credit Facility totaled $998 million net of outstanding letters of credit of $152 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 25, 2010. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.25% to 1.25% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or is determined by an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly. We also have a $350 million, syndicated revolving credit facility (the International Credit Facility, or ICF) which matures in November 2012 and includes 6 banks with commitments ranging from $35 million to $90 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. There was available credit of $350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2010. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.31% to 1.50% over LIBOR or is determined by a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branchs publicly announced reference rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUMs performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly. The Credit Facility and the ICF are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, the ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM. These agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. Given the Companys strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at December 25, 2010 with a considerable amount of cushion. The majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes with varying maturity dates from 2011 through 2037 and stated interest rates ranging from 3.88% to 8.88%. The Senior Unsecured Notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $3.3 billion at December 25, 2010 including $650 million in Senior Unsecured Notes due in April 2011. 51 Both the Credit Facility and the ICF contain cross default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million, or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness, will constitute a default under such agreement. Our Senior Unsecured Notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $50 million will constitute a default under the Senior Unsecured Notes if such acceleration is not annulled, or such indebtedness is not discharged, within 30 days after notice. Contractual Obligations In addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, our significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 25, 2010 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt obligations(a) $ 5,125 $ 804 $ 544 $ 533 $ 3,244 Capital leases(b) 380 26 86 46 222 Operating leases(b) 5,004 550 997 852 2,605 Purchase obligations(c) 788 625 131 23 9 Other(d) 43 12 15 6 10 Total contractual obligations $ 11,340 $ 2,017 $ 1,773 $ 1,460 $ 6,090 (a) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments. Rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on the LIBOR forward yield curve. Excludes a fair value adjustment of $31 million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 10. (b) These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to more than 6,000 restaurants. See Note 11. (c) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements. (d) Other consists of 2011 pension plan funding obligations and projected payments for deferred compensation. We have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $322 million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. These liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow. 52 We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees, the most significant of which are in the U.S. and U.K. The most significant of these plans, the YUM Retirement Plan (the Plan), is funded while benefits from the other U.S. plans are paid by the Company as incurred. Our funding policy for the Plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the Plans funded status. At December 25, 2010, the Plan was in a net underfunded position of $100 million. The U.K. pension plans are in a net underfunded positi on of $23 million at our 2010 measurement date. Based on the current funding status of the Plan and our UK pension plans, we will not be required to make significant contributions in 2011. Investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption. Future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions beyond 2011. Our post retirement plan in the U.S. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made post retirement benefit payments of $7 million in 2010 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table. See Note 14 for further details about our pension and post retirement plans. We have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured, including workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) and employee healthcare and long term disability claims. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare, long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have agreed to provide financial support, if required, to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and, to a lesser extent, in connection with the Companys historical refranchising programs. As part of this agreement, we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately $15 million and two letters of credit totaling approximately $23 million in support of the franchisee loan program at December 25, 2010. One such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee. The other letter of credit could be used, in certain circumstances, to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program. The total loans outstanding under the loan pool were $70 mil lion with an additional $30 million available for lending at December 25, 2010. Our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately $70 million and $40 million of debt outstanding as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidelines and clarifications for improving disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance requires enhanced disclosures for purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis for Level 3 fair value measurements. We do not anticipate the adoption of this guidance to materially impact the Company. These new disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. 53 In July 2010, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires new disclosures about an entitys allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables. Existing disclosures are amended to require an entity to provide certain disclosures on a disaggregated basis by portfolio segment or by class of financing receivables. The new disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010 and have been complied with in this Form 10 K. The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets We review our long lived assets of restaurants (primarily PP&E and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) that are currently operating semi annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability based on the restaurants forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. For restaurant assets that are not deemed to be recoverable, we write down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after tax cash flows of the restaurant and discount rate.&#1 60; The after tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. We perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after tax cash flows for the group of restaurants. The after tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets. Historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. The discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long lived assets. The discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. We have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant, such as the LJS and A&W trademark/brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights, which are amortized over their expected useful lives. We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept. We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate. These definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted after tax cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the assets future remaining life. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property, plant and equipment. 54 Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S., our YRI business units (typically individual countries) and our China Division brands. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after tax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties. Future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. The sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. We bel ieve the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. The fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2010 goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. However, our Pizza Hut United Kingdom (U.K.) reporting unit, for which $104 million in goodwill was recorded at year end 2010, has experienced deteriorating operating performance over the past several years as sales and profits have declined. Our forecasts of future cash flows in determining the fair value of this reporting unit incorporate plans that have been put into place to return the business to previous levels of profitability. These plans include specific measures to drive system sales growth, which is the assumption that most significantly drives the cash flow expectations and resulting fair value estimations of the reporting unit, over the next three years. While such forecasted system sales growth is higher than what we would normally anticipate for a mature market like Pizza Hut U.K., such growth is reflective of our belief that the business has experienced a temporary downturn and that sales declines in recent years can be recovered. If our plans to drive system sales growth are not achieved or are not expected to be achieved, this could impact future estimations of fair value of the Pizza Hut U.K. reporting unit and result in impairment of some or all of the Pizza Hut U.K. recorded goodwill. Likewise, if other events, such as higher than anticipated inflation that we were unable to recover through increased sales, were to occur that would negatively impact the outlook for the business and our resulting estimations of fair value, some or all of the goodwill could be impaired. When we refranchise restaurants we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. The fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. Appropriate adjustments are made if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates. W hen determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world. The Company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the Company and franchisee share in the impact of near term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties. 55 The discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the Company. The Company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising. Others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting units fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction. During 2010, the Companys reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our Taiwan business unit and our Pizza Hut U.S. operating segment. Within our Taiwan business unit, 124 restaurants were refranchised (representing 100% of beginning of year company units) and $7 million in goodwill was written off (representing 19% of beginning of year goodwill). Within our Pizza Hut U.S. operating segment, 278 restaurants were refranchised (representing 43% of beginning of year company units) and $3 million in goodwill was written off (representing 4% of beginning of year goodwill). See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill. Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/Guarantees Franchise and license receivable balances include royalties, initial fees as well as other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services. Our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon pre defined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. This methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at December 25, 2010. As such, we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at December 25, 2010. We have historically issued certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1) assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants, 2) facilitating franchisee development and 3) equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees. We recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification, such as renewals, when we remain contingently liable. The fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties. The potential total exposure for lease assignments is significant when aggregated, with approximately $450 million representing the present value, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at December 25, 2010. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. Additionally, we have guaranteed approximately $23 million of franchisee loans for various equipment programs. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under assigned leases and certain of the equipment loan programs. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guara ntees and, historically, we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees. If payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees. At December 25, 2010, we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable. If we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations. See Note 19 for a further discussion of our guarantees. 56 Self Insured Property and Casualty Losses We record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses. The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate. See Note 19 for a further discussion of our insurance programs. Pension Plans Certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans are in the U.S. We have recorded the under funded status of $201 million for these U.S. plans as a pension liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 25, 2010. These U.S. plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $1,108 million and a fair value of plan assets of $907 million at December 25, 2010. The PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. For our U.S. plans, we measured our PBO using a discount rate of 5.90% at December 25, 2010. This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary. The primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated Aa or higher by Moodys with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans. We excluded from the model tho se corporate debt instruments flagged by Moodys for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year. The weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $95 million at our measurement date. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $104 million at our measurement date. The pension expense we will record in 2011 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date. We expect pension expense for our U.S. plans to increase approximately $8 million to $49 million in 2011. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2011 U.S. pension expense by approximately $15 million. The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our estimated long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category, adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions. Our expected long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2011 pension expense, at December 25, 2010 was 7.75%. We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase, respectively, our 2011 U.S. pension plans expense by approximately $9 million. 57 The losses our U.S. plan assets have experienced, along with a decrease in discount rates over time, have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax net loss of $363 million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the U.S. plans at December 25, 2010. For purposes of determining 2010 expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $23 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost. We will recognize approximately $31 million of such loss in 2011. See Note 14 for further discussion of our pension plans. Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Expense Compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated on the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 15. Additionally, we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions. We have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and SAR awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures. These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the RGM Plan) and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans. Historically, approximately 10% 15% of total options and SARs granted have been made under the RGM Plan. Stock option and SAR grants under the RGM Plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25% per year over four years. We use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule. We reevaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis. Based on the results of this analysis, we have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives, respectively. Upon each stock award grant we reevaluate the expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options. We have estimated pre vesting forfeitures based on historical data. Based on such data, we believe that approximately 50% of all awards granted under the RGM Plan will be forfeited and approximately 25% of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited. 58 Income Taxes At December 25, 2010, we had a valuation allowance of $191 million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of $220 million, as well as our other deferred tax assets, to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits exist in state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage, including approximately $108 million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strat egies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our Income tax provision when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 25, 2010, we had $308 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $227 million of which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We evaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately ad justed for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures. Additionally, we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis, totaling approximately $1.3 billion at December 25, 2010, as we believe the excess is essentially permanent in duration. If our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances, deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact income taxes. See Note 17 for a further discussion of our income taxes. 59 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use. Interest Rate Risk We have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the U.S. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt. At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $8 million and $6 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 would decrease approximately $22 million and $20 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 would decrease approximately $191 million and $ 181 million, respectively. Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The combined International Division and China Division Operating Profits constitute more than 65% of our Operating Profit in 2010, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $3.2 billion as of December 25, 2010. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations, the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and ca sh flows. For the fiscal year ended December 25, 2010, Operating Profit would have decreased approximately $135 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is mini mized. Commodity Price Risk We are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors. 60
