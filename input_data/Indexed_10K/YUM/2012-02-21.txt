Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Introduction and OverviewThe following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 48 through 93 (Financial Statements) and the Forward Looking Statements on page 2 and the Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A. Throughout the MD&A, YUM! Brands, Inc. (YUM or the Company) makes reference to certain performance measures as described below.The Company provides the percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation (FX or Forex). These amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.System sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including Company owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants. Sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants generate franchise and license fees for the Company (typically at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales). Franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in Company sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the Companys revenues. We believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, Company and franchise same store sales as well as net unit development.Same store sales is the estimated growth in sales of all restaurants that have been open one year or more.Company restaurant profit is defined as Company sales less expenses incurred directly by our Company restaurants in generating Company sales. Company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as Company restaurant profit divided by Company sales.Operating margin is defined as Operating Profit divided by Total revenue.All Note references herein refer to the Notes to the Financial Statements on pages 54 through 93. Tabular amounts are displayed in millions of U.S. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified.Description of BusinessYUM is the worlds largest restaurant company in terms of system restaurants with approximately 37,000 restaurants in more than 120 countries and territories operating under the KFC, Pizza Hut or Taco Bell brands. In December of 2011 we sold our Long John Silvers ("LJS") and A&W All American Food Restaurants ("A&W") brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions. The results for these businesses through the sale dates are included in the Companys results for 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Companys restaurant brands KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza and Mexican style food categories, respectively. Of the approximately 37,000 restaurants, 20% are operated by the Company, 74% are operated by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates and 6% are operated by licensees.YUMs business consists of three reporting segments: China Division ("China"), YUM Restaurants International (YRI or International Division) and the United States. The China Division includes only mainland China, and YRI includes the remainder of our international operations. The China Division, YRI and Taco Bell U.S. now represent approximately 90% of the Companys operating profits, excluding Corporate and unallocated income and expenses. StrategiesThe Company continues to focus on four key strategies:Build Leading Brands in China in Every Significant Category The Company has developed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants, respectively, in mainland China. Additionally, the Company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in China which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage. Given this strong competitive position, a growing economy and a population of 1.3 billion in mainland China, the Company is rapidly adding KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of Pizza Hut Home Service (pizza delivery) and East Dawning (Chinese food). Additionally, on February 1, 2012 we acquired an additional 66% interest in 21Little Sheep Group Ltd. ("Little Sheep"), a leading casual dining concept in China. This acquisition brought our total ownership to approximately 93% of the business. Our ongoing earnings growth model in China includes double digit percentage unit growth, system sales growth of at least 13%, same store sales growth of at least 5% and moderate leverage of our General and Administrative (G&A) infrastructure, which we expect to drive Operating Profit growth of 15%. Drive Aggressive International Expansion and Build Strong Brands Everywhere The Company and its franchisees opened over 900 new restaurants in 2011 in the Companys International Division, representing 12 straight years of opening over 700 restaurants, making YRI one of the leading international retail developers in terms of units opened. The Company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including France, Germany, Russia and across Africa. The International Divisions Operating Profit has experienced a 9 year compound annual growth rate of 12%. Our ongoing earnings growth model for YRI includes Operating Profit growth of 10% driven by 3 4% unit growth, system sales growth of 6%, at least 2 3% same store sales growth, margin improvement and leverage of our G&A infrastructure.Dramatically Improve U.S. Brand Positions, Consistency and Returns The Company continues to focus on improving its U.S. position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience. The Company also strives to provide industry leading new product innovation which adds sales layers and expands day parts. We continue to evaluate our returns and ownership positions with an earn the right to own philosophy on Company owned restaurants. Our ongoing earnings growth model calls for Operating Profit growth of 5% in the U.S. Drive Industry Leading, Long Term Shareholder and Franchisee Value The Company is focused on delivering high returns and returning substantial cash flows to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The Company has one of the highest returns on invested capital in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry. The Companys dividend and share repurchase programs have returned over $2.1 billion and $6.7 billion to shareholders, respectively, since 2004. The Company is targeting an annual dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40% of net income and has increased the quarterly dividend at a double digit rate each year since inception in 2004. Shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions.The ongoing earnings growth rates referenced above represent our average annual expectations for the next several years. Details of our 2012 Guidance by division as presented on December 7, 2011 can be found online at http://www.yum.com.2011 HighlightsWorldwide system sales grew 7% prior to foreign currency translation, including 29% in China and 8% at YRI. System sales in the U.S. were flat. Same store sales grew 19% in China, 3% at YRI and declined 1% in the U.S. Record International development with 1,561 new restaurants including 656 in China and 905 at YRI. Worldwide operating profit grew 8%, including a positive impact from foreign currency translation of $77 million. Prior to foreign currency translation, operating profit grew 4%, including 15% in China and 9% at YRI, offsetting a 12% decline in the U.S. Worldwide restaurant margin declined 0.9 points to 16.0%. Increased annual dividend rate to $1.14 per share and repurchased 14.3 million shares totaling $733 million at an average price of $51. Increased return on invested capital to over 22%All preceding comparisons are versus the same period a year ago and exclude the impact of Special Items.

Included in Special Items are the impact of measures we took to transform our U.S. business (the U.S. business transformation measures) including: U.S. refranchising gains (losses), the depreciation reduction arising from the impairment of KFC restaurants we offered to sell in 2010 that remained Company restaurants for some or all of the periods presented, charges relating to U.S. G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources, investments in our U.S. Brands and a 2009 U.S. Goodwill impairment charge. Special Items also include losses and other costs related to the LJS and A&W divestitures, the losses associated with refranchising equity markets outside the U.S., the depreciation reduction from the impairment of Pizza Hut UK restaurants upon our decision to refranchise these restaurants in 2011 and the 2009 gain upon our acquisition of additional ownership in, and consolidation of, the operating entity that owns the KFCs in Shanghai, China. These amounts are further described below.The Company uses earnings before Special Items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally, and Special Items are not included in our China, YRI or U.S. segment results. This non GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of earnings before Special Items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items in 2011, 2010 and 2009 that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and or nature.23 Year 12/31/2011 12/25/2010 12/26/2009 Detail of Special Items U.S. Refranchising gain (loss) $(17) $(18) $34Depreciation reduction from KFC U.S. restaurants impaired upon offer to sell 10 9 Charges relating to U.S. G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources (21) (9) (16)Investments in our U.S. Brands (32)LJS and A&W Goodwill impairment charge (26)Losses and other costs relating to the LJS and A&W divestitures (86) Losses associated with refranchising equity markets outside the U.S. (76) (59) (10)Depreciation reduction from Pizza UK restaurants impaired upon decision to sell 3 Gain upon consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in China 68Special Items Income (Expense) (187) (77) 18Tax Benefit (Expense) on Special Items(a) 123 7 5Special Items Income (Expense), net of tax $(64) $(70) $23Average diluted shares outstanding 481 486 483Special Items diluted EPS $(0.13) $(0.15) $0.05Reconciliation of Operating Profit Before Special Items to Reported Operating Profit Operating Profit before Special Items $2,002 $1,846 $1,572Special Items Income (Expense) (187) (77) 18Reported Operating Profit $1,815 $1,769 $1,590Reconciliation of EPS Before Special Items to Reported EPS Diluted EPS before Special Items $2.87 $2.53 $2.17Special Items EPS (0.13) (0.15) 0.05Reported EPS $2.74 $2.38 $2.22Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate Before Special Items to Reported Effective Tax Rate Effective Tax Rate before Special Items 24.2 % 25.3% 23.1 %Impact on Tax Rate as a result of Special Items(a) (4.7)% 0.8% (0.7)%Reported Effective Tax Rate 19.5 % 26.1% 22.4 %(a)The tax benefit (expense) was determined based upon the impact of the nature, as well as the jurisdiction of the respective individual components within Special Items.U.S. Business TransformationThe U.S. business transformation measures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 included: continuation of our U.S. refranchising; G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources (primarily severance and early retirement costs); a reduced emphasis on multi branding as a long term growth strategy; and investments in our U.S. Brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases. In the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, we recorded pre tax losses of $17 million and $18 million from refranchising in the U.S., respectively. In the year ended December 26, 2009, we recorded a pre tax refranchising gain of $34 million in the U.S. The losses recorded in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 are primarily the net result of gains from restaurants sold and non cash impairment charges related to our offers to refranchise restaurants in the U.S., principally a substantial portion of our Company operated KFC restaurants. The non cash impairment charges that we recorded related to our offers to refranchise these Company operated KFC restaurants in the U.S. decreased depreciation expense versus what we would have otherwise recorded by $10 million and $9 million in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively. This depreciation reduction was recorded as a Special Item, resulting in depreciation expense in the U.S. segment 24results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants. Refranchising gains and losses are more fully discussed in Note 4 and the Store Portfolio Strategy Section of the MD&A.In connection with our G&A productivity initiatives and realignment of resources (primarily severance and early retirement costs), we recorded pre tax charges of $21 million, $9 million and $16 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively. As a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our LJS and A&W U.S. businesses due in part to the impact of a reduced emphasis on multi branding, we recorded a non cash charge of $26 million, which resulted in no related income tax benefit, in Closures and impairment expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 to write off goodwill associated with our LJS and A&W U.S. businesses we owned at the time.Additionally, the Company recognized a reduction to Franchise and license fees and income of $32 million, pre tax, in the year ended December 26, 2009 related to investments in our U.S. Brands. These investments reflected our reimbursements to KFC franchisees for installation costs of ovens for the national launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. The reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to Franchise and license fees and income as we would not have provided the reimbursements absent the ongoing franchisee relationship.LJS and A&W DivestituresDuring the fourth quarter of 2011 we sold the Long John Silvers and A&W All American Food Restaurants brands to key franchise leaders and strategic investors in separate transactions.We recognized $86 million of pre tax losses and other costs primarily in Closures and impairment (income) expenses during 2011 as a result of these transactions. Additionally, we recognized $104 million of tax benefits related to tax losses associated with the transactions. In 2011, these businesses contributed 5% to both System sales and Franchise and license fees and income for the U.S. segment, and 1% to both System sales and Franchise and license fees and income for the YRI segment. While these businesses contributed 1% to both the U.S. and YRI segments Operating Profit in 2011, the impact on our consolidated Operating Profit was not significant.Refranchising of Equity Markets Outside the U.S.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we decided to refranchise or close all of our remaining Company operated Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK market. While an asset group comprising approximately 350 dine in restaurants did not meet the criteria for held for sale classification as of December 31, 2011, our decision to sell was considered an impairment indicator. As such we reviewed this asset group for potential impairment and determined that its carrying value was not recoverable based upon our estimate of expected refranchising proceeds and holding period cash flows anticipated while we continue to operate the restaurants as company units. Accordingly, we wrote this asset group down to our estimate of its fair value, which is based on the sales price we would expect to receive from a buyer. This fair value determination considered current market conditions, trends in the Pizza Hut UK business, and prices for similar transactions in the restaurant industry and resulted in a pre tax, non cash write down of $74 million which was recorded to Refranchising (gain) loss. This impairment charge decreased depreciation expense versus what would have otherwise been recorded by approximately $3 million in 2011. This depreciation reduction was recorded as a Special Item, resulting in depreciation expense in the YRI segment results continuing to be recorded at the rate at which it was prior to the impairment charges being recorded for these restaurants. We will continue to review the asset group for any further necessary impairment until the date it is sold. The write down does not include any allocation of the Pizza Hut UK reporting unit goodwill in the asset group carrying value. This additional non cash write down would be recorded, consistent with our historical policy, if the asset group ultimately meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Upon the ultimate sale of the restaurants, depending on the form of the transaction, we could also be required to record a charge for the fair value of any guarantee of future lease payments for any leases we assign to a franchisee and for the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment associated with Pizza Hut UK. The decision to refranchise or close all remaining Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK was considered to be a goodwill impairment indicator. We determined that the fair value of our Pizza Hut UK reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and as such there was no impairment of the approximately $100 million in goodwill attributable to this reporting unit. We also recorded a $2 million loss in Refranchising (gain) loss for obligations that we believe are probable related to the proposed refranchising of Pizza Hut UK.In the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a $52 million loss on the refranchising of our Mexico equity market as we sold all of our Company operated restaurants, comprised of 222 KFC and 123 Pizza Huts, to an existing Latin American franchise partner. The buyer is also serving as the master franchisee for Mexico which had 102 KFCs and 53 Pizza Hut franchise restaurants at the time 25of the transaction. The write off of goodwill included in this loss was minimal as our Mexico reporting unit included an insignificant amount of goodwill. This loss did not result in a related income tax benefit.During the year ended December 26, 2009 we recognized a non cash $10 million refranchising loss as a result of our decision to offer to refranchise our KFC Taiwan equity market. During the year ended December 25, 2010 we refranchised all of our remaining company restaurants in Taiwan, which consisted of 124 KFCs. We included in our December 25, 2010 financial statements a non cash write off of $7 million of goodwill in determining the loss on refranchising of Taiwan. Neither of these losses resulted in a related income tax benefit. The amount of goodwill write off was based on the relative fair values of the Taiwan business disposed of and the portion of the business that was retained. The fair value of the business disposed of was determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurants and retained by the franchisee, which included a deduction for the anticipated royalties the franchisee was estimated to pay the Company associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. The fair value of the Taiwan business retained consisted of expected net cash flows to be derived from royalties from franchisees, including the royalties associated with the franchise agreement entered into in connection with this refranchising transaction. We believe the terms of the franchise agreement entered into in connection with the Taiwan refranchising were substantially consistent with market. The remaining carrying value of goodwill related to our Taiwan business of $30 million, was determined not to be impaired subsequent to the refranchising as the fair value of the Taiwan reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.Consolidation of a Former Unconsolidated Affiliate in Shanghai, ChinaOn May 4, 2009 we acquired an additional 7% ownership in the entity that operates more than 200 KFCs in Shanghai, China for $12 million, increasing our ownership to 58%. Prior to our acquisition of this additional interest, this entity was accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate under the equity method of accounting. Concurrent with the acquisition we received additional rights in the governance of the entity and thus we began consolidating the entity upon acquisition. As required by GAAP, we remeasured our previously held 51% ownership in the entity, which had a recorded value of $17 million at the date of acquisition, at fair value and recognized a gain of $68 million accordingly. This gain, which resulted in no related income tax expense, was recorded in Other (income) expense in our 2009 Consolidated Statement of Income.Under the equity method of accounting, we previously reported our 51% share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate (after interest expense and income taxes) as Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the restaurants owned by the unconsolidated affiliate. Subsequent to the date of the acquisition, we reported the results of operations for the entity in the appropriate line items of our Consolidated Statements of Income. We no longer recorded franchise fee income for these restaurants nor did we report Other (income) expense as we did under the equity method of accounting. Net income attributable to our partners ownership percentage is recorded in Net Income noncontrolling interests. For the year ended December 25, 2010, the consolidation of the existing restaurants upon acquisition increased Company sales by $98 million, decreased Franchise and license fees and income by $6 million and increased Operating Profit by $3 million versus the year ended December 26, 2009. The impact of the acquisition on Net Income YUM! Brands, Inc. was not significant to the year ended December 25, 2010.Extra Week in 2011Our fiscal calendar results in a 53rd week every five or six years. Fiscal year 2011 included a 53rd week in the fourth quarter for all our U.S. businesses and certain of our YRI businesses that report on a period, as opposed to a monthly, basis. Our China Division reports on a monthly basis and thus did not have a 53rd week. See the System Sales Growth section within our MD&A for further discussion on the impact of 53rd week on system sales. The following table summarizes the estimated impact of the 53rd week on revenues and operating profit:26 U.S. YRI Unallocated TotalRevenues Company sales $43 $29 $ $72 Franchise and license fees 13 6 19Total Revenues $56 $35 $ $91Operating profit Franchise and license fees $13 $6 $ $19 Restaurant profit 9 6 15 General and administrative expenses (4) (4) (1) (9)Operating profit(a) $18 $8 $(1) $25 (a)The $25 million benefit was offset throughout 2011 by investments, including franchise development incentives, as well as higher than normal spending, such as restaurant closures in the U.S. and YRI.Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Little Sheep On February 1, 2012 we paid $584 million to acquire an additional 66% interest in Little Sheep, a leading Chinese casual dining concept with approximately 450 system wide restaurants headquartered in Inner Mongolia, China. This acquisition brought our total ownership to approximately 93% of the business. We expect that the consolidation of Little Sheep will increase our revenue in China in 2012 by approximately 5%, with only a corresponding modest impact to Operating profit given the transaction and transition related costs we expect to incur in our initial year of ownership.YRI AcquisitionsOn October 31, 2011 YRI acquired 68 KFC restaurants from an existing franchisee in South Africa for $71 million. On July 1, 2010, we completed the exercise of our option with our Russian partner to purchase their interest in the co branded Rostiks KFC restaurants across Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States. As a result, we acquired company ownership of 50 restaurants and gained full rights and responsibilities as franchisor of 81 restaurants, which our partner previously managed as master franchisee. We paid cash of $60 million, net of settlement of a long term note receivable of $11 million, and assumed long term debt of $10 million which was subsequently repaid. The remaining balance of the purchase price of $12 million will be paid in cash by July 2012. The impact of consolidating these businesses on all line items within our Consolidated Statement of Income was insignificant to the comparison of our year over year results and is not expected to materially impact our results going forward.Pizza Hut South Korea Goodwill ImpairmentAs a result of a decline in future profit expectations for our Pizza Hut South Korea business, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $12 million for this market during 2009. This charge was recorded in Closure and impairment (income) expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income and was allocated to our International Division for performance reporting purposes.Store Portfolio StrategyFrom time to time we sell Company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance, while retaining Company ownership of strategic U.S. and international markets in which we choose to continue investing capital. In the U.S., we are targeting Company ownership of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants of about 8%, down from its current level of 13%, with our primary remaining focus being refranchising at KFC and Taco Bell to about 5% and 16% Company ownership, respectively. Consistent with this strategy, 404, 404 and 541 Company restaurants in the U.S. were sold to franchisees in the years ended December 31, 2011, December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, we have offered for refranchising approximately 250 KFCs in the U.S. Additionally, we have offered for refranchise all remaining Company owned restaurants in the Pizza Hut UK business (approximately 420 restaurants remaining as of December 31, 2011) and during 2010, we refranchised all Company owned KFCs and Pizza Huts in Mexico (345 restaurants) and KFCs in Taiwan (124 restaurants).27The following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities: 2011 2010 2009Number of units refranchised 529 949 613Refranchising proceeds, pre tax $246 $265 $194Refranchising (gain) loss, pre tax $72 $63 $(26)Refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure. Additionally, G&A expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities. The timing of G&A declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals. G&A expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct G&A that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or a portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year.The impact on Operating Profit arising from refranchising is the net of (a) the estimated reductions in restaurant profit, which reflects the decrease in Company sales, and G&A expenses and (b) the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised. The tables presented below reflect the impacts on Total revenues and on Operating Profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year. In these tables, Decreased Company sales and Decreased Restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year. Increased Franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the Company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were Company stores in the prior year.The following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on Total revenues as described above: 2011 China YRI U.S. WorldwideDecreased Company sales $(36) $(311) $(404) $(751)Increased Franchise and license fees and income 6 25 27 58Decrease in Total revenues $(30) $(286) $(377) $(693) 2010 China YRI U.S. WorldwideDecreased Company sales $(20) $(183) $(401) $(604)Increased Franchise and license fees and income 3 9 25 37Decrease in Total revenues $(17) $(174) $(376) $(567)The following table summarizes the impact of refranchising on Operating Profit as described above: 2011 China YRI U.S. WorldwideDecreased Restaurant profit $(5) $(25) $(43) $(73)Increased Franchise and license fees and income 6 25 27 58Increased Franchise and license expenses (2) (2) (2) (6)Decreased G&A 21 6 27Increase (decrease) in Operating Profit $(1) $19 $(12) $628 2010 China YRI U.S. WorldwideDecreased Restaurant profit $(3) $(5) $(44) $(52)Increased Franchise and license fees and income 3 9 25 37Increased Franchise and license expenses Decreased G&A 9 6 15Increase (decrease) in Operating Profit $ $13 $(13) $Internal Revenue Service Proposed AdjustmentOn June 23, 2010 the Company received a Revenue Agent Report from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) relating to its examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. The IRS has proposed an adjustment to increase the taxable value of rights to intangibles used outside the U.S. that YUM transferred to certain of its foreign subsidiaries. The proposed adjustment would result in approximately $700 million of additional taxes plus net interest to date of approximately $170 million. Furthermore, if the IRS prevails it is likely to make similar claims for years subsequent to fiscal 2006. The potential additional taxes for these later years, through 2011, computed on a similar basis to the 2004 2006 additional taxes, would be approximately $350 million plus net interest to date of approximately $25 million.We believe that the Company has properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and that the proposed adjustment is inconsistent with applicable income tax laws, Treasury Regulations and relevant case law. We intend to defend our position vigorously and have filed a protest with the IRS. As the final resolution of the proposed adjustment remains uncertain, the Company will continue to provide for its position in accordance with GAAP. There can be no assurance that payments due upon final resolution of this issue will not exceed our currently recorded reserve and such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Additionally, if increases to our reserves are deemed necessary due to future developments related to this issue, such increases could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations as they are recorded. The Company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with certainty the timing of such resolution.International Reporting ChangeIn the first quarter of 2012, we will begin reporting information for our India business as a standalone reporting segment separate from YRI as a result of changes to our management reporting structure. While our consolidated results will not be impacted, we will restate our historical segment information during 2012 for consistent presentation. This new segment will also include the franchise businesses in the neighboring countries of Bangladesh, Mauritius, Nepal and Sri Lanka.29Restaurant Unit ActivityWorldwide Franchisees Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Total Excluding Licensees(a)Balance at end of 2009 26,745 7,666 469 34,880New Builds 952 607 62 1,621Acquisitions (110) 110 Refranchising 949 (949) Closures (668) (163) (6) (837)Other (16) (16)Balance at end of 2010 27,852 7,271 525 35,648 New Builds 1,058 749 73 1,880Acquisitions (137) 137 Refranchising 529 (529) Closures (743) (191) (11) (945)LJS & A&W Divestitures(b) (1,633) (1,633)Other 2 2Balance at end of 2011 26,928 7,437 587 34,952% of Total 77% 21% 2% 100%China Franchisees Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Total Excluding Licensees(a)Balance at end of 2009 118 2,866 469 3,453New Builds 3 442 62 507Acquisitions Refranchising 33 (33) Closures (1) (47) (6) (54)Other Balance at end of 2010 153 3,228 525 3,906New Builds 4 579 73 656Acquisitions Refranchising 47 (47) Closures (3) (55) (11) (69)Other Balance at end of 2011 201 3,705 587 4,493% of Total 4% 83% 13% 100%30YRI Franchisees Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Total Excluding Licensees(a)Balance at end of 2009 11,808 2,000 13,808New Builds 801 83 884Acquisitions (53) 53 Refranchising 512 (512) Closures (346) (65) (411)Other Balance at end of 2010 12,722 1,559 14,281 New Builds 823 82 905Acquisitions (86) 86 Refranchising 78 (78) Closures (333) (56) (389)LJS & A&W Divestitures(b) (347) (347)Other 3 3Balance at end of 2011 12,860 1,593 14,453% of Total 89% 11% % 100%U.S. Franchisees Company Unconsolidated Affiliates Total Excluding Licensees(a)Balance at end of 2009 14,819 2,800 17,619New Builds 148 82 230Acquisitions (57) 57 Refranchising 404 (404) Closures (321) (51) (372)Other (16) (16)Balance at end of 2010 14,977 2,484 17,461 New Builds 231 88 319Acquisitions (51) 51 Refranchising 404 (404) Closures (407) (80) (487)LJS & A&W Divestitures(b) (1,286) (1,286)Other (1) (1)Balance at end of 2011 13,867 2,139 16,006% of Total 87% 13% % 100%(a)The Worldwide, YRI and U.S. totals exclude 2,169, 125 and 2,044 licensed units, respectively, at December 31, 2011. While there are no licensed units in China, we have excluded from the Worldwide and China totals 7 Company owned units that are similar to licensed units. The units excluded offer limited menus and operate in non traditional locations like malls, airports, gasoline service stations, train stations, subways, convenience stores, stadiums and amusement parks where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient. As licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units, we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information at this time.(b)The reductions to Worldwide, YRI and U.S. totals of 1,633, 347 and 1,286, respectively during 2011 represent the number of LJS and A&W units as of the beginning of 2011. Therefore, 2011 New Builds and Closures exclude any activity related to LJS and A&W.31Multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above. Multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count. Similarly, a new multibrand restaurant, while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands, results in just one additional unit count.System Sales GrowthThe following tables detail the key drivers of system sales growth for each reportable segment by year.

Store portfolio actions represent the net impact of new unit openings, acquisitions, refranchisings and store closures on Company sales or Restaurant profit. The impact of new unit openings and acquisitions represent the actual Company sales or Restaurant profit for the periods the Company operated the restaurants in the current year but did not operate them in the prior year. The impact of refranchisings and store closures represent the actual Company sales or Restaurant profit for the periods in the prior year while the Company operated the restaurants but did not operate them in the current year.The dollar changes in Company Restaurant profit by year were as follows:China 2011 vs. 2010Income / (Expense) 2010 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2011Company sales $4,081 $436 $720 $250 $5,487Cost of sales (1,362) (150) (346) (89) (1,947)Cost of labor (587) (96) (166) (41) (890)Occupancy and other (1,231) (159) (107) (71) (1,568)Restaurant profit $901 $31 $101 $49 $1,082Restaurant margin 22.1% 19.7%32 2010 vs. 2009Income / (Expense) 2009 Store Portfolio Actions Other FX 2010Company sales $3,352 $484 $207 $38 $4,081Cost of sales (1,175) (162) (12) (13) (1,362)Cost of labor (447) (78) (56) (6) (587)Occupancy and other (1,025) (160) (35) (11) (1,231)Restaurant profit $705 $84 $104 $8 $901Restaurant margin 21.0% 22.1% In 2011, the increase in China Company sales and Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by the development of new units partially offset by lapping the benefit of our participation in the World Expo in 2010. Significant other factors impacting Company sales and or Restaurant profit were Company same store sales growth of 18% which was driven by transaction growth partially offset by a negative impact from sales mix shift and a new business tax that took effect December 2010, wage rate inflation of 20% as well as commodity inflation of $90 million, or 8%.In 2010, the increase in China Company sales and Restaurant profit associated with store portfolio actions was primarily driven by the development of new units and the acquisition of additional interest in and consolidation of a former China unconsolidated affiliate during 2009 (See Note 4 for further discussion) and $16 million in Restaurant profit from our brands participation in the World Expo during 2010. Significant other factors impacting Company sales and or Restaurant profit were Company same store sales growth of 6% and commodity deflation of $26 million partially offset by labor inflation.

Additionally, interest income increased due to higher cash balances.The decrease in Interest expense, net for 2010 was driven by both a decrease in average net borrowings and a decline in interest rates on the variable portion of our debt.Income TaxesThe reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the U.S. federal tax statutory rate to our effective tax rate is set forth below: 2011 2010 2009U.S. federal statutory rate $580 35.0% $558 35.0% $489 35.0%State income tax, net of federal tax benefit 2 0.1 12 0.7 14 1.0Statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations (218) (13.1) (235) (14.7) (159) (11.4)Adjustments to reserves and prior years 24 1.4 55 3.5 (9) (0.6)Net benefit from LJS and A&W divestitures (72) (4.3) Change in valuation allowances 22 1.3 22 1.4 (9) (0.7)Other, net (14) (0.9) 4 0.2 (13) (0.9)Income Tax Provision $324 19.5% $416 26.1% $313 22.4%Statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations. This item includes local taxes, withholding taxes, and shareholder level taxes, net of foreign tax credits. The favorable impact is primarily attributable to a majority of our income being earned outside of the U.S. where tax rates are generally lower than the U.S. rate.In 2011 and 2010, the benefit was positively impacted by the recognition of excess foreign tax credits generated by our intent to repatriate current year foreign earnings.In 2009, the benefit was negatively impacted by withholding taxes associated with the distribution of intercompany dividends that were only partially offset by related foreign tax credits generated during the year.Adjustments to reserves and prior years. This item includes: (1) the effects of reconciling income tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income to amounts reflected on our tax returns, including any adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets; and (2) changes in tax reserves, including interest thereon, established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position. We evaluate these amounts on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for audit settlements and other events we believe may impact the outcome. The impact of certain effects or changes may offset items reflected in the Statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations line.In 2009, this item included out of year adjustments which lowered our effective tax rate by 1.6 percentage points.Change in valuation allowance. This item relates to changes for deferred tax assets generated or utilized during the current year and changes in our judgment regarding the likelihood of using deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year. The impact of certain changes may offset items reflected in the Statutory rate differential attributable to foreign operations line.In 2011, $22 million of net tax expense was driven by $15 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year and $7 million of tax expense resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of certain foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year. These amounts exclude $45 million in valuation 38allowance additions related to capital losses recognized as a result of the LJS and A&W divestitures, which are presented within Net Benefit from LJS and A&W divestitures.In 2010, the $22 million of net tax expense was driven by $25 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the current year. This expense was partially offset by a $3 million tax benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of U.S. state deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year.In 2009, the $9 million net tax benefit was driven by $25 million of benefit resulting from a change in judgment regarding the future use of foreign deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of the year. This benefit was partially offset by $16 million for valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated during the year.Net benefit from LJS and A&W divestitures. This item includes a one time $117 million tax benefit, including approximately $8 million state benefit, recognized on the LJS and A&W divestitures in 2011, partially offset by $45 million of valuation allowance, including approximately $4 million state expense, related to capital loss carryforwards recognized as a result of the divestitures. In addition, we recorded $32 million of tax benefits on $86 million of pre tax losses and other costs which resulted in $104 million of total net tax benefits related to the divestitures.Other. This item primarily includes the impact of permanent differences related to current year earnings and U.S. tax credits.In 2009, this item was positively impacted by a one time pre tax gain of approximately $68 million, with no related income tax expense, recognized on our acquisition of additional interest in, and consolidation of, the entity that operates KFC in Shanghai, China. This was partially offset by a pre tax U.S. goodwill impairment charge of approximately $26 million, with no related income tax benefit.Consolidated Cash FlowsNet cash provided by operating activities was $2,170 million compared to $1,968 million in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before Special Items.In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,968 million compared to $1,404 million in 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating profit before Special Items and decreased pension contributions.Net cash used in investing activities was $1,006 million versus $579 million in 2010. The increase was driven by an increase in Restricted cash and higher capital spending.In 2010, net cash used in investing activities was $579 million versus $727 million in 2009. The decrease was driven by lapping the 2009 acquisition of a non controlling interest in Little Sheep, and increased proceeds from refranchising, partially offset by the 2010 acquisition of our partners interest in Rostiks KFC. See Note 4 for further discussion.Net cash used in financing activities was $1,413 million versus $337 million in 2010. The increase was driven by lower net borrowings and an increase in share repurchases.In 2010, net cash used in financing activities was $337 million versus $542 million in 2009. The decrease was driven by higher net borrowings, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases.Consolidated Financial ConditionThe increase in Restricted cash was due to $300 million in funds placed in escrow which were restricted to the acquisition of an additional 66% interest in Little Sheep. See Notes 4 and 21.The decrease in Intangible assets was primarily due to the LJS and A&W divestitures. See Note 4.The decrease in Short term borrowings was primarily due to the maturity of $650 million of Senior Unsecured Notes in April 2011, offset by $263 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due in June 2012 being classified as short term as of December 31, 2011.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOperating in the QSR industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited YUM investment. Net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $1 billion in each of the last ten fiscal years, including over $2 billion in 2011. We expect these levels of net cash provided by 39operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future. However, unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized.In the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns, we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects. Our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants, acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock and dividends paid to our shareholders. Additionally, as of December 31, 2011 we had approximately $1.1 billion in unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities that expire in November 2012, primarily related to a domestic facility. We are in the process of renewing these facilities.China and YRI represented more than 70% of the Companys operating profit in 2011 (excluding Corporate and unallocated income and expenses) and both generate a significant amount of positive cash flows that we have historically used to fund our international development. To the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our U.S. discretionary cash spending, including share repurchases, dividends and debt repayments, we have historically been able to do so in a tax efficient manner. If we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our U.S. business or are unable to refinance future U.S. debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced. We currently have investment grade ratings from Standard & Poors Rating Services (BBB ) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa3). While we do not anticipate a downgrade in our credit rating, a downgrade would increase the Companys current borrowing costs and could impact the Companys ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary. Based on the amount and composition of our debt at December 31, 2011, which included no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, our interest expense would not materially increase on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings.Discretionary SpendingDuring 2011, we invested $940 million in capital spending, including approximately $405 million in China, $256 million in YRI and $279 million in the U.S. For 2012, we estimate capital spending will be approximately $1 billion.During the year ended December 31, 2011 we repurchased shares for $752 million, which includes the effect of $19 million in share repurchases with trade dates prior to the 2010 fiscal year end but cash settlement dates subsequent to the 2010 fiscal year. In January 2011, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases through July 2012 of up to $750 million (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding Common Stock, and on November 18, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized additional share repurchases through May 2013 of up to $750 million (excluding applicable transaction fees) of our outstanding Common Stock. At December 31, 2011, we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to approximately $938 million of outstanding Common Stock (excluding applicable transaction fees) under these authorizations. Shares are repurchased opportunistically as part of our regular capital structure decisions.During the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid cash dividends of $481 million. Additionally, on November 18, 2011 our Board of Directors approved cash dividends of $0.285 per share of Common Stock to be distributed on February 3, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 13, 2012. The Company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40% of net income.In connection with the proposal to acquire an additional 66% of Little Sheep, we placed $300 million in escrow to demonstrate availability of funds to acquire additional shares in this business. The funds placed in escrow were restricted to the pending acquisition of Little Sheep and are separately presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2011. In February 2012, the funds were released from escrow upon our acquisition of Little Sheep. See Notes 4 and 21 for details.Borrowing CapacityOur primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.15 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) which matures in November 2012 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from $20 million to $93 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. Under the terms of the Credit Facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or bankers acceptances, where applicable. At December 31, 2011, our unused Credit Facility totaled $727 million net of outstanding letters of credit of $423 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2011. The interest rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility ranges from 0.25% to 1.25% over the London Interbank Offered Rate 40(LIBOR) or is determined by an Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends on our performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility is payable at least quarterly.We also have a $350 million, syndicated international revolving credit facility (the ICF) which matures in November 2012 and includes six banks with commitments ranging from $35 million to $90 million. We believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank. There was available credit of $350 million and no borrowings outstanding under the ICF at the end of 2011. The interest rate for borrowings under the ICF ranges from 0.31% to 1.50% over LIBOR or is determined by a Canadian Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of the Citibank, N.A., Canadian Branchs publicly announced reference rate or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.50%. The exact spread over LIBOR or the Canadian Alternate Base Rate, as applicable, depends upon YUMs performance under specified financial criteria. Interest on any outstanding borrowings under the ICF is payable at least quarterly. The Credit Facility and the ICF are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries. Additionally, the ICF is unconditionally guaranteed by YUM. These agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. Given the Companys strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at December 31, 2011 with a considerable amount of cushion.We are in the process of renewing these facilities.Our remaining long term debt primarily comprises Senior Unsecured Notes with varying maturity dates from 2012 through 2037 and interest rates ranging from 2.38% to 7.70%. The Senior Unsecured Notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. Amounts outstanding under Senior Unsecured Notes were $3.0 billion at December 31, 2011 including $263 million in Senior Unsecured Notes due in July 2012.Both the Credit Facility and the ICF contain cross default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million, or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness, will constitute a default under such agreement. Our Senior Unsecured Notes provide that the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $50 million will constitute a default under the Senior Unsecured Notes if such acceleration is not annulled, or such indebtedness is not discharged, within 30 days after notice.Contractual ObligationsIn addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make, our significant contractual obligations and payments as of December 31, 2011 included: Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 YearsLong term debt obligations(a) $4,774 $414 $339 $814 $3,207Capital leases(b) 437 65 53 52 267Operating leases(b) 5,337 612 1,116 956 2,653Purchase obligations(c) 797 695 77 16 9Other(d) 72 37 16 7 12Total contractual obligations $11,417 $1,823 $1,601 $1,845 $6,148(a)Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments. Rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on the LIBOR forward yield curve. Excludes a fair value adjustment of $26 million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt. See Note 10.(b)These obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate to nearly 6,200 restaurants. See Note 11.41(c)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. We have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology, marketing, commodity agreements, purchases of property, plant and equipment as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements.(d)Other consists of 2012 pension plan funding obligations and projected payments for deferred compensation.We have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $327 million of long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken. These liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. These liabilities also include potential payments that would be refunded in a future year and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow.We sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees, the most significant of which are in the U.S. and UK. The most significant of these plans, the YUM Retirement Plan (the Plan), is funded while benefits from the other U.S. plans are paid by the Company as incurred. Our funding policy for the Plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the Plans funded status. At December 31, 2011 the Plan was in a net underfunded position of $248 million. The UK pension plans are in a net underfunded position of $4 million at our 2011 measurement date.Based on the current funding status of the Plan and our UK pension plans, we currently estimate that we will be required to contribute approximately $30 million to the Plan in 2012. No required contributions to the UK pension plans are expected in 2012. Investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumption. Future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2012 and beyond.Our post retirement plan in the U.S. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go. We made post retirement benefit payments of $5 million in 2011 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table. See Note 14 for further details about our pension and post retirement plans.We have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured, including workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively property and casualty losses) and employee healthcare and long term disability claims. The majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare, long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have agreed to provide financial support, if required, to an entity that operates a franchisee lending program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and, to a lesser extent, in connection with the Companys historical refranchising programs. As part of this agreement, we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately $14 million and two letters of credit totaling approximately $23 million in support of the franchisee loan program at December 31, 2011. One such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee. The other letter of credit could be used, in certain circumstances, to satisfy our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program. The total loans outstanding under the loan pool were $63 million with an additional $17 million available for lending at December 31, 2011.Our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately $75 million and $70 million of debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (Topic 820) Fair Value Measurement (ASU 2011 04), to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011 04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011 04 is effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2012 and will be applied 42prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2011 04, but currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05), to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011 05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011 05 is effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2012 and will be applied retrospectively. The Company currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this standard.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years. A description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows.Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived AssetsWe review long lived assets of restaurants (primarily PP&E and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) that are currently operating semi annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability based on the restaurants forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants. For restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after tax cash flows of the restaurant, which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay, and discount rate. The after tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.We perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group. Expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given the discounted projected after tax cash flows, reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay, for the group of restaurants. The after tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets. Historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received.The discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long lived assets. The discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.We have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant, such as trademark/brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights, which are amortized over their expected useful lives. We base the expected useful lives of our trademark/brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment, our future development plans for the applicable Concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the Concept. We generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate.These definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted after tax cash flows. For purposes of our impairment analysis, we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the assets future remaining life.See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of property, plant and equipment.43Impairment of GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. Our reporting units are our operating segments in the U.S., our YRI business units (typically individual countries) and our China Division brands. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after tax cash flows from company operations and franchise royalties.Future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit. Future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. The sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. We believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.The fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2011 goodwill impairment test that was performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. When we refranchise restaurants, we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. The fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. Appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value amount being disposed if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates. When determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world. The Company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the Company and franchisee share in the impact of near term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties.The discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the Company. The Company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising. Others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting units fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction.During 2011, the Companys reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were our KFC U.S. operating segment and our Pizza Hut United Kingdom (U.K.) business unit. Within our KFC U.S. operating segment, 264 restaurants were refranchised (representing 34% of beginning of year company units) and $8 million in goodwill was written off (representing 7% of beginning of year goodwill). Within our Pizza Hut U.K. business unit, 47 delivery restaurants were refranchised (representing 10% of beginning of year company units) and $4 million in goodwill was written off (representing 4% of beginning of year goodwill). See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill.Allowances for Franchise and License Receivables/GuaranteesFranchise and license receivable balances include royalties, initial fees and other ancillary receivables such as rent and fees for support services. Our reserve for franchisee or licensee receivable balances is based upon pre defined aging criteria or upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due. This methodology results in an immaterial amount of unreserved past due receivable balances at December 31, 2011. As such, we believe our allowance for franchise and license receivables is adequate to cover potential exposure from uncollectible receivable balances at December 31, 2011.We issue certain guarantees on behalf of franchisees primarily as a result of 1) assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases, primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain Company restaurants, 2) facilitating franchisee development and 3) equipment financing arrangements to facilitate the launch of new sales layers by franchisees. We recognize a liability for the fair value of such guarantees upon inception of the guarantee and upon any subsequent modification, such as franchise lease renewals, 44when we remain contingently liable. The fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties.The present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases, discounted at our pre tax cost of debt, is approximately $550 million, at December 31, 2011. Current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases. Additionally, we have guaranteed approximately $17 million of franchisee loans for various programs. We generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under assigned leases and certain of the loan programs. We believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these guarantees and, historically, we have not been required to make significant payments for guarantees. If payment on these guarantees becomes probable and estimable, we record a liability for our exposure under these guarantees. At December 31, 2011 we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure under these guarantees which we consider to be probable and estimable. If we begin to be required to perform under these guarantees to a greater extent, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.See Note 2 for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations.See Note 19 for a further discussion of our guarantees.Self Insured Property and Casualty LossesWe record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured workers compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively "property and casualty losses"). The estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs. Additionally, our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate.See Note 19 for a further discussion of our insurance programs.Pension PlansCertain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. The most significant of these plans are in the U.S. We have recorded the under funded status of $383 million for these U.S. plans as a pension liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011. These U.S. plans had a projected benefit obligation (PBO) of $1,381 million and a fair value of plan assets of $998 million at December 31, 2011.The PBO reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels. Due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our PBOs are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates. For our U.S. plans, we measured our PBO using a discount rate of 4.90% at December 31, 2011. This discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary. The primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated Aa or higher by Moodys with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plan. We excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by Moodys for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean. In considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year. Such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year. The weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate. We also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. A 50 basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $107 million at our measurement date. Conversely, a 50 basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our U.S. plans PBO by approximately $121 million at our measurement date.The pension expense we will record in 2012 is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date. We expect pension expense for our U.S. plans to increase approximately $36 million in 2012. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss due to a decrease in the discount rate. A 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2012 U.S. pension expense by approximately $17 million.The assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense. Our estimated long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category, 45adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions. Our expected long term rate of return on U.S. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2012 pension expense, at December 31, 2011 was 7.25%. We believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon. A one percentage point change in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2012 U.S. pension expense by approximately $10 million.A decrease in discount rates over time along with actual asset returns below expected returns have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax actuarial net loss of $540 million included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the U.S. plans at December 31, 2011. For purposes of determining 2011 pension expense, our funded status was such that we recognized $31 million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost. We will recognize approximately $63 million of such loss in 2012.See Note 14 for further discussion of our pension plans.Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights ExpenseCompensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights (SARs) is estimated on the grant date using a Black Scholes option pricing model. Our assumptions for the risk free interest rate, expected term, expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in Note 15. Additionally, we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized. Future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions.We have determined that it is appropriate to group our stock option and SAR awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures. These groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our Restaurant General Manager Stock Option Plan (the RGM Plan) and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans. Historically, approximately 10% 15% of total options and SARs granted have been made under the RGM Plan.Stock option and SAR grants under the RGM Plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest 25% per year over four years. We use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule. We re evaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis. We have determined that five years and six years are appropriate expected terms for awards to restaurant level employees and to executives, respectively.Upon each stock award grant we re evaluate the expected volatility, including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options. We have estimated pre vesting forfeitures based on historical data. Based on such data, we believe that approximately 50% of all awards granted under the RGM Plan will be forfeited and approximately 25% of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited.Income TaxesAt December 31, 2011, we had valuation allowances of $368 million to reduce our $1.3 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized. The net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in currently profitable U.S. federal and state, and foreign jurisdictions as well as U.S. federal and state tax credit carryovers that may be carried forward for ten years. The estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. Thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes.As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our Income Tax Provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2011 we had $348 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $197 million of which, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. We evaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures.Additionally, we have not provided deferred tax for investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis, totaling approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2011, as we believe the excess is essentially permanently invested. If our intentions regarding the duration of theses investments change, deferred tax may need to be provided on this excess that could materially impact the provision for income taxes.See Note 17 for a further discussion of our income taxes.46Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. In the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies, we manage these risks through a variety of strategies, which may include the use of financial and commodity derivative instruments to hedge our underlying exposures. Our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes, and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use.Interest Rate RiskWe have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates, principally in the U.S. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt. Accordingly, any change in fair value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite impact on the related debt.At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short term interest rates would result, over the following twelve month period, in a reduction of approximately $5 million and $8 million, respectively, in income before income taxes. The estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 would decrease approximately $16 million and $22 million, respectively. The fair value of our Senior Unsecured Notes at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010 would decrease approximately $228 million and $191 million, respectively. Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskChanges in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our reported foreign currency denominated earnings, cash flows and net investments in foreign operations and the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments. Historically, we have chosen not to hedge foreign currency risks related to our foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows through the use of financial instruments. We attempt to minimize the exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical. In addition, we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical. Consequently, foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables. At times, we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables. The notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized.The combined Operating Profits of China and YRI constitute more than 70% of our Operating Profit in 2011, excluding unallocated income (expenses). In addition, the Companys foreign currency net asset exposure (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) totaled approximately $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2011. Operating in international markets exposes the Company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Companys primary exposures result from our operations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 Operating Profit would have decreased approximately $170 million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened 10% relative to the U.S. dollar. The estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices.Commodity Price RiskWe are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is, at times, limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors.47
