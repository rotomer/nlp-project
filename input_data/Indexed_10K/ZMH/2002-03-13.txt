Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements. Overview The Company is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive implants and fracture management products. Orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Fracture management products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the bodys natural healing process. The Company also manufactures and markets surgical products for orthopaedic and general surgery. With operations in 20 countries and products marketed in 70 countries, operations are managed through three geographic regions the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. Separation from Bristol Myers Squibb The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol Myers Squibb on January 12, 2001. On July 25, 2001, Bristol Myers Squibb transferred the assets and liabilities of its orthopaedic business to the Company. On August 6, 2001, Bristol Myers Squibb distributed all of the shares of Company common stock to Bristol Myers Squibb stockholders in the form of a dividend of one share of Company common stock, and the associated preferred stock purchase right, for every ten shares of Bristol Myers Squibb common stock. In addition, the Company assumed all obligations under a $600 million credit facility (Credit Facility) established by the Company and its former parent with then outstanding borrowings of $290 million. With additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Company repaid amounts due to its former parent of approximately $90 million, and finally, the Company assumed an additional $22 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility for separation costs. In addition, the Company recognized certain liabilities and obligations for pension, postretirement, long term disability and U.S. sales agent benefits. Recognition of these liabilities, obligations and other adjustments are reflected in the remaining net investment in the Company by its former parent of $14.1 million as of the distribution date. The distribution qualified as a tax free transaction under Section 355 and 368(a)(1)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as more fully described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Item 8. The Company incurred $70.0 million ($49.9 million net of taxes) in costs, fees and expenses relating to the separation from Bristol Myers Squibb and the related distribution of Company common stock to Bristol Myers Squibb stockholders which was partially funded by additional borrowings under the credit facility. The costs, fees and expenses are primarily for retention bonuses, legal separation matters, professional expenses and costs of producing, printing, mailing and distributing the information statement relating to the distribution. Except for separation costs and the ongoing interest cost associated with debt assumed or incurred as of the distribution date, the Company does not currently anticipate that operating costs resulting from the separation from its former parent will materially impact its cost structure as reflected in its historical consolidated results. Reported and Pro Forma Results of Operations The following discussion of operations presents both reported and unaudited pro forma results of operations. Unaudited pro forma financial information is presented herein to provide users of the financial statements with information about the impact of the Companys separation from its former parent. The separation costs described above are attributable to the distribution, and the Company anticipates no further separation costs. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001, presented herein, has been prepared giving effect to the exclusion of costs incurred by 14 Table of Contents the Company to separate from its former parent and includes a full year of interest expense on debt expected to be assumed or incurred at the distribution date as if such debt were outstanding from January 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001 does not purport to represent what results of operations actually would have been or to project financial performance for any future period. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The following table sets forth the reported and pro forma consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, Reported Pro Forma 2001 2000 1999 2001 (Unaudited) Net Sales $ 1,178.6 $ 1,040.6 $ 938.9 $ 1,178.6 Cost of products sold 325.9 290.9 269.3 314.0 (a) Gross Profit 852.7 749.7 669.6 864.6 Research and development 71.6 52.0 45.2 68.4 (a) Selling, general and administrative 532.8 429.7 393.5 477.9 (a) Operating expenses 604.4 481.7 438.7 546.3 Operating Profit 248.3 268.0 230.9 318.3 Interest expense 7.4 21.4 (b) Earnings before income taxes 240.9 268.0 230.9 296.9 Provision for income taxes 91.1 92.0 81.0 106.1 (c) Net Earnings $ 149.8 $ 176.0 $ 149.9 $ 190.8 Earnings Per Share Basic $ 0.77 $ 0.91 $ 0.77 $ 0.99 Diluted $ 0.77 $ 0.91 $ 0.77 $ 0.98 Average Shares Outstanding Basic 193.7 193.6 193.6 193.7 Diluted 194.3 193.6 193.6 194.3 The pro forma adjustments to the accompanying reported historical financial information for the year ended December 31, 2001 are described below: (a) Reflects the add back of costs related to the separation of the Company from its former parent. The Company incurred $70 million in separation costs ($49.9 million net of tax). (b) Reflects interest expense related to debt expected to be assumed or incurred under the Credit Facility (see Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Assumed average borrowings from January 1 through July 31, 2001 were $450 million at an average interest rate of 5.4 percent and includes the amortization of fees. (c) Reflects the tax effect of the pro forma adjustments for separation costs and interest expense using a rate of 26.8 percent, reflecting the non deductibility of certain separation costs. 15 Table of Contents The following tables set forth sales by geographic region and product category for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (in millions): Net Sales by Geographic Region Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Americas $ 790.7 $ 655.4 $ 587.9 Asia Pacific 255.2 264.5 235.3 Europe 132.7 120.7 115.7 Total $ 1,178.6 $ 1,040.6 $ 938.9 Net Sales by Product Category Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Reconstructive implants $ 886.5 $ 764.5 $ 679.1 Fracture management 128.3 123.4 112.8 Orthopaedic surgical products 163.8 152.7 147.0 Total $ 1,178.6 $ 1,040.6 $ 938.9 Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased 13 percent (increased 17 percent constant currency). Sales growth reflected strong demand for reconstructive implants and outstanding results in the Companys largest operating segment, the Americas. This increase in the Americas was partially offset by weak local currencies in Asia Pacific and Europe. This increase was comprised of a 14 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, a 3 percent increase due to higher average selling prices and a 4 percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The introduction of new materials, techniques and technologies has contributed to a significant increase in demand for the Companys products and has generally had a favorable effect on sales as average selling prices for the new materials and technologies generally exceed those being replaced. For example, sales have been favorably affected by a market shift from cruciate retaining designs to posterior stabilized designs for total knee procedures. The Company maintains a relatively strong market position in posterior stabilized knees. Sales have also benefited from a market shift from cemented components to higher priced porous components for total hip replacements. Introduction of the ZMR Revision Hip System provided the Company with a more comprehensive offering in a market subcategory that is reported to experience a higher growth rate than primary hip replacements. Introduction of the Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Articular Surface for total knee replacement procedures exemplifies the Companys continued use of innovative materials and technologies and follows the successful introduction of the Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liner for total hip replacement procedures. The market acceptance of the Longevity Polyethylene Liner, which commands premium prices in most markets over the standard polyethylene liner, has been rapid. Net sales in the Americas increased 21 percent to $790.7 million compared to 2000. This increase was comprised of a 16 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, together with a 5 percent increase due to higher average selling prices. Sales of reconstructive implants increased 25 percent with strong sales in all categories. Knee sales increased 25 percent led by growth in sales of NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized Knee, the recently introduced NexGen Legacy posterior stabilized flex knee, as well as the M/G Unicompartmental Knee, now featuring MIS instrumentation. Hip sales increased 23 percent, driven by continued conversion to porous stems, the ZMR 16 Table of Contents Modular Revision Hip System, Trabecular Metal acetabular cups, and increased sales of Trilogy Acetabular System cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Fracture management product sales increased 11 percent, in large part due to the introduction of the new ZPS internal fixation devices during the fourth quarter and increased sales in fracture instruments. Net sales in Asia Pacific decreased 4 percent to $255.2 million compared to 2000. This decrease was comprised of an 8 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, which was more than offset by a 12 percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Knee sales decreased 6 percent (increased 5 percent constant currency), reflecting continuing strong sales of NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee. Hip sales decreased 2 percent (increased 9 percent constant currency) driven primarily by continued conversion to porous stems, introduction of the ZMR Revision Hip System and sales of Trilogy cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Fracture management products decreased 8 percent (increased 3 percent constant currency) with higher sales of M/DN Intramedullary Fixation nails offset by weaker sales of compression hip screws. Net sales in Europe increased 10 percent (increased 14 percent constant currency) to $132.7 million compared to 2000. This increase was comprised of a 13 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, a 1 percent increase due to higher average selling prices and a 4 percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This increase was driven by double digit growth in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Knee sales increased 13 percent (increased 17 percent constant currency) driven by strong sales of the NexGen Legacy knee prostheses system as well as M/G Unicompartmental Knee with MIS instrumentation. Hip sales increased 11 percent (increased 15 percent constant currency) supported by the recent introduction of the ZMR Revision Hip System and increased sales of Trilogy cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Fracture management sales decreased 8 percent (decreased 4 percent constant currency) in comparison to high volume tender sales that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2000. Overall, worldwide reconstructive implant sales increased 16 percent (increased 19 percent constant currency) to $886.5 million. Knee sales increased by 16 percent (increased 20 percent constant currency) to $481.7 million, reflecting continued strong sales of the NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized Knee and NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee, introduced recently in the Americas. Hip sales increased by 15 percent (increased 19 percent constant currency) to $376.6 million, driven by continued conversion to porous hip stems, strong sales of Trilogy cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and the continuing introduction of the ZMR Revision Hip System. Fracture management product sales increased 4 percent (increased 8 percent constant currency) to $128.3 million, driven by the introduction of the new ZPS internal fixation devices and strong sales of M/ DN nails in Asia Pacific. Orthopaedic surgical product sales increased 7 percent (increased 10 percent constant currency) to $163.8 million, led by the introduction of the OrthoPAT Autotransfusion System, that can be used perioperatively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 72.3 percent in 2001, or 73.4 percent excluding separation costs of $11.9 million, compared to 72.0 percent in 2000. This increase was due to higher average selling prices, favorable premium priced product mix, as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies associated with increased sales volume and enhanced productivity. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and inflationary expense increases, including wages and fringe benefits. Research and development as a percentage of net sales was 6.1 percent in 2001, or 5.8 percent excluding separation costs of $3.2 million, compared to 5.0 percent in 2000. This increase was due to higher spending on research and development activities focused on broadening the Companys product offerings in areas such as less invasive approaches to orthopaedic procedures, incorporation of new materials such as Trabecular Metal and highly crosslinked polyethylene. Research and development expenditures, consistent with the Companys strategy to offer innovative new products and comprehensive solutions, increased over 50 percent to $68.4 million, excluding separation costs, for the 2 year period ended December 31, 2001. 17 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 45.2 percent in 2001, or 40.5 percent excluding separation costs of $54.9 million, compared to 41.3 percent in 2000. In the fourth quarter 2001, the Company recorded a $3.0 million pretax charge for possible payments of non reimbursed, direct medical expenses to certain patients who choose to revise recalled Saint Gobain manufactured zirconia femoral heads. Excluding the costs of separation and charges related to Saint Gobain, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11 percent to $474.9 million in 2001 from $429.7 million in 2000. This increase was driven by an increase in selling and marketing expenses where the Company continued to invest in selling and marketing programs, including sales force expansion, support for the U.S. distributor network, target direct to customer advertising and the establishment of the MIS business unit. General and administrative expenses, in dollar terms, remained constant in 2001 compared with 2000, reflecting strict expense controls across all geographic regions. Over the four year period ended December 31, 2001, general and administrative expenses excluding the aforementioned $3.0 million have remained constant while net sales increased by over $300 million. In 2000 the Company recorded pretax charges of $14 million related to changes made to its operations as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Item 8. Operating profit decreased 7 percent in 2001 to $248.3 million from $268.0 million in 2000. Excluding separation costs of $70.0 million, operating profit increased 19 percent to $318.3 million, due primarily to the increase in gross profit margin, together with expense leveraging. The effective tax rate on earnings before taxes increased to 37.8 percent in 2001 compared to 34.3 percent in 2000. Excluding separation costs and including pro forma interest expense for 2001, the effective tax rate increased to 35.7 percent. The tax provision prior to August 6, 2001 was computed by the Companys former parent. The Companys tax rate after August 6, 2001 was 36.1 percent on a pro forma separate return basis. Net earnings decreased 15 percent in 2001 to $149.8 million from $176.0 million in 2000. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 15 percent in 2001 to $0.77 from $0.91 in 2000. Excluding separation costs of $49.9 million, net of tax, and including incremental pro forma interest expense, net of tax, of $8.9 million, pro forma net earnings were $190.8 million for 2001. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2001, on a pro forma basis, were $0.99 and $0.98, respectively. Adjusting 2000 for a full year of assumed interest of $29.0 million, net of tax of $19.1 million, net earnings would have been $156.9 million, or $0.81 per share for both basic and diluted. This assumes that $500.0 million of debt would have been outstanding for the full year 2000 at an interest rate of 5.7 percent. Pro forma net earnings of $190.8 million for 2001 represent a 22 percent increase from 2000 net earnings, adjusted for a full year of assumed interest, of $156.9 million. Basic earnings per share on the same basis reflect an increase of 22 percent in 2001, to $0.99 from $0.81 in 2000, while diluted earnings per share increased 21 percent in 2001, to $0.98 from $0.81 in 2000. Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999 Net sales increased 11 percent for the year ended December 31, 2000. Sales growth reflected strong demand for reconstructive implants and fracture management products, which was aided in part by the introduction of new products. This increase was comprised of a 10 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales and a 1 percent increase due to higher average selling prices. Net sales in the Americas increased 11 percent in 2000 to $655.4 million, led by growth in the southeast region of the United States and at targeted teaching hospitals throughout the United States. This increase was comprised of a 9 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, together with a 2 percent increase due to higher average selling prices. Sales of reconstructive implants increased 16 percent supported by new product launches. Knee sales increased 10 percent led by growth in sales of the NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized Knee. Hip sales increased 18 Table of Contents 19 percent, driven by strong sales of VerSys porous hip stems, the introduction of ZMR hip, the new modular revision hip product and increased sales of Trilogy acetabular cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Fracture management product sales increased 9 percent with the ongoing introduction of periarticular plating system and the M/DN intramedullary nail. Net sales in Asia Pacific increased 13 percent in 2000 (increased 7 percent constant currency) to $264.5 million, driven by the introduction of new products in the reconstructive implant and fracture management product lines. This increase was comprised of an 8 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, a 1 percent decrease due to lower average selling prices and a 6 percent increase due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The lower average selling prices were the result of reductions in Japan in government reimbursement prices for reconstructive implants, which went into effect during the fourth quarter of 2000. Knee sales increased 14 percent (increased 10 percent constant currency), driven by the introduction of the NexGen Legacy Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee, a product designed to accommodate deep knee flexion, which is more common in day to day activities in Asia. Hip sales increased 7 percent (increased 2 percent constant currency), driven primarily by strong sales of VerSys porous hip stems and Trilogy acetabular cups. Fracture management product sales increased 13 percent (increased 6 percent constant currency), reflecting a net increase due to strong M/DN intramedullary nail sales offset by lower sales of compression hip screws compared to 1999 in which there was a new product launch. Net sales in Europe increased 4 percent in 2000 to $120.7 million, driven by higher sales in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France and Italy. This increase was comprised of a 17 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales offset by a 13 percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Knee sales increased 3 percent (increased 17 percent constant currency), driven by strong sales of the NexGen Legacy system of knee prostheses. Hip sales increased 5 percent (increased 17 percent constant currency), supported by the introduction of ZMR revision hip system and the offering of specialized hip products that appeal to European surgical philosophies, such as CPT, SKF/SKT and the Mercure hip. Fracture management product sales increased 2 percent (increased 13 percent constant currency) with the introduction of the M/DN intramedullary nail. Overall, worldwide reconstructive implant sales increased by 13 percent in 2000 to $764.5 million. During this period, foreign exchange rate fluctuations had no material effect on overall reconstructive implant sales. Knee sales increased by 10 percent (increased 11 percent constant currency) to $413.7 million, driven primarily by strong sales of NexGen Legacy knee prostheses across all regions. Hip sales increased by 14 percent (increased 13 percent constant currency) to $328.7 million, reflecting increased market penetration of porous hip stems and Trilogy acetabular cups in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Fracture management product sales increased worldwide by 10 percent (increased 9 percent constant currency) in 2000 to $123.4 million. This increase was driven primarily by sales of the recently launched MD/N intramedullary nail in all regions. Orthopaedic surgical product sales increased by 4 percent overall in 2000 to $152.7 million. This increase was driven primarily by sales of distributed powered instruments and arthroscopy products in Asia Pacific. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 72.0 percent in 2000, compared to 71.3 percent in 1999. This increase was driven by lower product costs due to negotiated decreases in raw material costs, the rationalization of manufacturing operations and investment in more efficient manufacturing equipment. Research and development as a percentage of net sales in 2000 remained at the 1999 level of 5 percent. Research and development expenditures increased 15 percent to $52.0 million in 2000 from $45.2 million in 1999. This increase was due, in part, to increased spending on engineering, development and commercialization activities as the Company broadened its product offerings and in part, to design and development consulting in support for design and concept testing of new products, greater demand for post market clinical studies and prospective and retrospective clinical evaluations. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 41.3 percent in 2000, compared to 41.9 percent in 1999. This decrease was due to lower distribution expenses in Asia Pacific where selected distribution and customer service functions were consolidated, which was partially offset by 19 Table of Contents hiring of new sales associates and support personnel and increased commissions in the Americas due to a greater number of distributors exceeding sales targets. General and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2000 while sales increased 11 percent. In 2000 and 1999 the Company recorded pretax charges of $14 million and $15 million, respectively, related to changes made to its operations as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Item 8. Operating profit increased 16 percent in 2000 to $268.0 from $230.9 million in 1999. This increase was due to lower product costs, consolidation of distribution and customer service functions in Asia Pacific and strict control on general and administrative expenses. The effective tax rate on earnings before taxes decreased to 34.3 percent compared to 35.1 percent in 1999. This decrease was due to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings increased 17 percent to $176.0 million from $149.9 million in 1999. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 18 percent to $0.91 from $0.77 in 1999. Operating Profit by Segment The following table sets forth the operating profit by segment for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: Operating Profit by Segment Percent of net sales Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Americas 47 % 48 % 47 % Asia Pacific 41 38 33 Europe 16 15 20 Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000 Operating profit for the Americas as a percentage of net sales decreased to 47 percent in 2001 from 48 percent in 2000. This decrease reflects higher selling expenses partially offset by favorable effects of increased sales of higher margin products and higher average selling prices. Operating profit for Asia Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased to 41 percent in 2001 from 38 percent in 2000. While revenues were adversely affected by weak local currencies, the negative impact of foreign currency on sales was largely mitigated in operating profit by gains on derivative financial instruments (more fully described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Item 8), asset management and expense reduction initiatives. Operating profit for Europe as a percentage of net sales increased to 16 percent in 2001 from 15 percent in 2000. The increase in 2001 was due to favorable country and product mix. Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999 Operating profit for the Americas as a percentage of sales increased to 48 percent in 2000 from 47 percent in 1999. This increase reflects the favorable effects of increased sales of higher margin products, higher average selling prices and reduced product cost. Operating profit for Asia Pacific as a percentage of net sales increased to 38 percent in 2000 from 33 percent in 1999. This increase reflects lower operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Operating profit for Europe as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15 percent in 2000 from 20 percent in 1999. This decrease was due principally to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. 20 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations was $171.8 million in 2001, compared with $232.4 million in 2000 and $180.1 million in 1999. The decrease in cash flow from operations in 2001 was primarily attributable to the incurrence of separation costs. Excluding separation costs and including incremental pro forma interest, pro forma cash flow generated from operations was $214.9 million in 2001. If the Company had adjusted 2000 for a full year of assumed interest, cash flow from operations for 2000 would have been $213.3 million. The increase of $1.6 million from 2000 to 2001 was due to increases in net earnings, accounts payable due to favorable payment terms, other current liabilities for royalties and commissions as a result of higher net sales, offset by inventory investment necessary for new product introductions. Working capital management remained strong. Accounts receivable days decreased to 52 days in 2001, 10 days lower than 2000, reflecting improved collections and credit terms in the Americas and an improvement in the negotiated payment terms in Asia Pacific. Accounts receivable days in the Americas are consistently below 40. Consistent with the Companys strategy to expand product offerings, the Company expects to maintain inventory at a level that ensures the successful launch of a continuous stream of new products. Inventory days increased to 221 days in 2001. This increase was due to investments necessary to support the launch of new products during 2001 and 2002. Cash flow used in investing activities, principally capital expenditures, was $54.7 million in 2001, compared with $29.0 million in 2000 and $33.2 million in 1999. The increase in capital expenditures in 2001 was driven by investments to increase manufacturing and distribution capacity, investments for new product development and the expansion of the Companys main distribution facility in Warsaw, Indiana to support sales growth, the purchase of computer hardware and software for a new information technology system for the Companys North American operations and additional computer system infrastructure required as a result of the separation. On July 31, 2001, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a $600 million three year, multi currency, revolving senior unsecured credit agreement (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. Available borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2001 were $241.8 million. Cash provided by operating and financing activities was also used in 2001 to fund payments to the Companys former parent for dividends of $290.0 million, debt due of $144.0 million and other items of $32.8. The Company had $18.4 million in cash and equivalents and outstanding borrowings of $363.9 million as of December 31, 2001. The Company maintains a capital structure that is consistent with an investment grade credit rating. Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet the Companys working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs in the near term. Should investment opportunities arise, the Company believes that its earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow the Company to obtain additional capital, if necessary. The ability to issue additional equity is subject to limitations in order to preserve the tax free nature of the distribution. Under the tax sharing agreement with its former parent, the Company is required to indemnify the former parent for the amount of any tax imposed under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. Significant Accounting Policies As indicated elsewhere in this Form 10 K, management is responsible for the integrity of the financial information presented herein. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Where necessary, they reflect estimates based on managements judgment. When selecting or evaluating accounting alternatives, management focuses on those, subject to considerations of cost of administration, that produce from among the available alternatives information most useful for decision making. Significant accounting policies that are important to the portrayal of the 21 Table of Contents Companys financial condition and results, which, in some cases require managements judgment, are summarized in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Item 8. These include but are not limited to accounting for inventories, prepaid expenses, income taxes, derivative financial instruments, product liability and stock compensation. While alternative methods of accounting for these items could result in different amounts to be reported under different conditions or using alternative assumptions, in the aggregate, such differences are not likely to materially or adversely affect the Companys financial condition. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Information about recent accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Item 8. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Risk The Company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, that could impact its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities, and on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its operating results, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese Yen and the Euro. The Company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows the Company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. In order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward or options contracts with major international financial institutions. These forward and option contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings. The notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts, principally Japanese Yen and the Euro, entered into with third parties, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, were $82 million and $39 million, respectively. For all contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001: the Company has rights to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Japanese Yen; contract maturity dates range from January 2002 to December 2002; and the weighted average contract rate is Yen 117. The Company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities. The Companys policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of its risk management program, the Company furthermore performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001, indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the Japanese Yen, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes, depending on the direction of the change, by approximately $8.2 million. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result 22 Table of Contents of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because contract gains and losses would offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. The Company had exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $87 million and $49 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily in the Japanese Yen and the Euro. Commodity Price Risk The Company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, medical grade polymer and sterile packaging. The Company enters into 12 to 24 month supply contracts on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices. As part of the Companys risk management program, sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Interest Rate Risk In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities. Presently, the Company invests its cash and cash equivalents in money market and other interest bearing accounts. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk. Currently, the Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. The Company is subject to movements in interest rate risk on the committed Credit Facility and its uncommitted credit facilities. All of its debt outstanding is floating. The Company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure. If interest rates were to increase 10 percent (or 35 basis points), assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, the result would be an annual increase of interest expense of approximately $1.3 million. However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no such action, nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes. Further, this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Presently, the Company intends to utilize cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings. Credit Risk A substantial portion of the Companys trade receivables is due from hospitals and other healthcare providers. The Company generally does not receive collateral for these receivables. Although the concentration of these receivables with customers in a similar industry poses a risk of non collection, the Company believes this risk is mitigated somewhat by the large number and geographic dispersion of these customers and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and the Company believes that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk. 23 Table of Contents
