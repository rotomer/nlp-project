ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements. OVERVIEW Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal implants, and trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products (OSP). Orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the bodys natural healing process. The Companys related orthopaedic surgical products include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures. With operations in more than 24 countries and products marketed in more than 100 countries, operations are managed through three reportable geographic segments the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. As used in this discussion, the Company means Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Company believes that the following developments or trends are important to understanding the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2004. Acquisitions of Centerpulse and Implex The Centerpulse acquisition, completed in the fourth quarter of 2003, had a significant impact on financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004. Centerpulse accounted for 37 percentage points of the Companys 57 percent sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company incurred $81.1 million of Centerpulse and Implex acquisition and integration expenses. The Companys gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2004 was also impacted by the Centerpulse and Implex acquisitions, as an inventory step up charge reduced reported gross profit by $59.4 million (2.0 percent of sales). Inventory step up as used herein represents the difference between the cost basis and the fair value of acquired Centerpulse and Implex inventories. SFAS No. 141 requires the recorded values for acquired inventories to be adjusted from cost to fair value at the date of acquisition based upon estimated sales price less distribution costs and a profit allowance. Inventory step up charge(s) as used herein represents the amount of non cash expense that is recorded upon the sale of acquired inventories. Net synergies associated with the acquisition and integration of Centerpulse were approximately $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to an original estimate of $1 million. As anticipated, only modest synergies were recognized in cost of goods sold during 2004. More significant cost of goods synergies are expected to be recognized in 2005 and 2006 upon depletion of acquired inventories, upon completion of the transfer of production from Centerpulses U.S. manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas to other Company manufacturing facilities in Warsaw, Indiana, Winterthur, Switzerland and Ponce, Puerto Rico and upon completion of the manufacturing portion of the integration plan including, for example, in sourcing forgings and castings. Operating expense synergies, principally in selling, general and administrative expenses, have exceeded the Companys original expectations, reflecting more rapid than expected execution and achievement of operational efficiencies. However, these cost synergies were partially offset by negative sales synergies (losses), also anticipated, and increases in other expenses. Estimated sales losses, including distributor buy backs (accounted for as sales returns) related to distribution restructuring, were $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Increases in other expenses during 2004 include higher distributor commissions, professional fees connected with corporate compliance and training programs and relocation and recruiting to fill open positions. Net synergies for 2005 are expected to approximate $63 million compared to the Companys original estimate of $56 million. Net synergies for 2006 are expected to be in excess of $100 million compared to the Companys original estimate of $70 to $90 million. The Company continues to manage the integration of Centerpulse. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has completed over 60 percent of the 3,364 scheduled milestones required to execute the entire integration. The Company has made substantial progress in developing global combined product strategies, in integrating the sales and business organizations, and in melding essential activities as diverse as global accounting policies and procedures, manufacturing processes and E mail systems. During 2004, the Company, among other things: combined and trained sales organizations created common branding worldwide created common worldwide financial consolidation and quality systems implemented a global product development system to improve speed to market consolidated its orthobiologics research activities in Austin, Texas in sourced a variety of formerly out sourced manufacturing functions initiated a worldwide supply chain strategic plan for manufacturing and distribution networks unified professional medical education initiatives 20 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K completed the closure of Centerpulses former headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland began the transfer of production from Centerpulses U.S. manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas to Warsaw, Indiana, Winterthur, Switzerland and Ponce, Puerto Rico implemented a more tax efficient global business structure completed approximately 75 percent of the Warsaw, Indiana and Ponce, Puerto Rico plant expansions, with Winterthur, Switzerland expansion plans initiated consolidated North American distribution and customer service functions Remaining integration milestones relate primarily to the completion of the manufacturing integration plan, including the shut down of manufacturing operations in Austin, Texas and the in sourcing of a variety of formerly out sourced manufacturing functions, including forging and casting production. In addition to the remaining manufacturing integration milestones, other integration activities still to be completed include the establishment of common information technology systems and certain warehouse consolidations. The Company expects to incur approximately $45 million of integration expenses during 2005 to complete the remaining integration milestones. The Company completed the acquisition of Implex on April 23, 2004. During 2004, the Company paid approximately $153.1 million in initial Implex acquisition costs, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was a culmination of a distribution and strategic alliance agreement relating to the development and distribution of reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology. Pursuant to the former distribution and strategic alliance agreement, the Company sold products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology. Prior to the acquisition, over 90 percent of Implex sales were Trabecular Metal Technology sales to the Company. Therefore, the acquisition did not result in the immediate addition of significant new customers or sales for the Company. Post acquisition profit margins on Company products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology also did not immediately improve as these sales consisted primarily of inventory that the Company already had on hand at the acquisition date. In addition, during 2004 the Company recorded amortization expense of approximately $4 million related to acquired technology intangible assets. Therefore, the acquisition reduced diluted EPS by an estimated $0.02 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company expects to realize significantly improved future profit margins on Trabecular Metal Technology product sales as it sells inventory manufactured after the acquisition date. In addition, due to continued strong demand for products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology, the Company expects to triple its Trabecular Metal Technology manufacturing capacity, which will lead to future sales increases and improved profit margins as a result of manufacturing efficiencies. Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends On a pro forma11 basis, volume and mix improvements contributed 9 percentage points of sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2004. Orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques (such as the Companys MIS Procedures and Technologies) and more active lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the continued shift in demand to premium products, such as Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners, Trabecular Metal Technology products, high flex knees, knee and hip revision products and porous hip stems, continue to positively impact sales growth. For the year ended December 31, 2004, primary porous hip stems accounted for 63 percent of all Zimmer standalone primary hip stem units sold, compared to 46 percent, 53 percent and 59 percent of total primary hip stem units sold for Zimmer standalone in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Zimmer standalone sales as used herein refers to sales for the period less sales from acquired Centerpulse businesses. The Company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the orthopaedics industry. The Company has made significant progress in the development and introduction of MIS Procedures and Technologies. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company trained more than 1,400 surgeons at The Zimmer Institute and its satellite locations in MIS Techniques, including the MIS 2 Incision Hip Replacement Technique and MIS Quad Sparing Knee Replacement Technique. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company estimates that 50 percent and 36 percent of all Zimmer standalone U.S. hip and knee sales, respectively, utilized an MIS Procedure and or Technology. Pricing Trends In the Americas, the Companys largest operating segment, the Company realized pro forma average selling price growth of 4 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004. In Europe, pro forma sales growth reflected flat average selling prices during the year. However, during the fourth quarter of 2004, European average selling prices decreased approximately 1 percent, primarily due to a 6 percent price decrease in Germany, principally the result of a revised reimbursement system implemented by the German government. In the Asia Pacific operating segment on a pro forma basis, the Company experienced an average selling price reduction of 2 percent during the year ended December 31, 2004, principally the result of the Japanese 11 The unaudited pro forma net sales information, including comparisons to 2004 net sales, contained in this Form 10 K and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles has been derived from the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the financial statements of Centerpulse for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 to give effect to the Centerpulse acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2003. 21 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

Pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts, group purchasing organizations and potential gain sharing arrangements between surgeons and hospitals may negatively affect the Companys ability to realize global price increases of 2 3 percent. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates A weakened U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to last year contributed 4 percentage points sales growth, on a pro forma basis. The Company addresses currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, through the use of simple forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk. The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes is prohibited. New Product Sales New products, which management defines as products introduced within the prior 36 month period, accounted for 18 percent, or $541 million, of the Companys sales during the year ended December 31, 2004. Adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of industry performance. Sales have grown with the introduction of new products such as Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene for the knee, which was introduced in 2002, and represented approximately 49 percent of all cruciate retaining articulating surface product sales and 12 percent of all knee articulating surfaces for the year ended December 31, 2004. Adoption rates for the Companys new products should continue to favorably affect the Companys operating performance.

In addition, the NexGen Rotating Hinge Knee and the Innex Total Knee System exhibited strong growth. Hip sales were led by growth in porous stems, including significant growth of the VerSys Fiber Metal and Zimmer M/L Taper Stems (the stems of choice for MIS Procedures), Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups, Trilogy Acetabular Cups, Durom Hip Resurfacing Products, and Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. The Alloclassic Hip System and Allofit Acetabular Shell also had strong growth. Dental sales were led by sales of biologicals, surgical products and prosthetic implants, including strong growth of the SwissPlus Implant System and Tapered Screw Vent Internal Hex Implant System. Extremities sales were led by the Bigliani/ Flatow Shoulder. Trauma sales were led by sales of Zimmer Periarticular Plates, Cable Ready Cable Products, Zimmer Plates and Screws System, ITST and Sirius Intramedullary Nails, TransFx External Fixation System and the Trabecular Metal AVN Rod. Spine sales were led by the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and Trinica Select Anterior Cervical Plate System. OSP sales were primarily driven by the continued growth of the OrthoPAT Autotransfusion System and wound management and drainage products.

Pro forma dental sales growth of 22 percent (19 percent volume/mix and 3 percent price), outpaced the market due to strong sales of biologicals, surgical products and prosthetic implants; the continued rebranding to Zimmer also was a positive factor. The Companys pro forma 2004 sales growth rates for extremities, trauma and spine were below the corresponding estimated market growth rates, reflecting market share loss. Extremities and spine lagged the overall market growth rate due to the fact that the Company does not have a complete product offering to compete effectively with the product category market leaders. Trauma is lagging the overall market growth rate due to delays in new product introductions. Comparison of the OSP pro forma growth rate to a market growth rate is not meaningful due to the fragmented nature of the market.

The following table reconciles the gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the three month period ended December 31, 2003. Three month period ended December 31, 2003 gross margin 68.1 % Inventory step up charge 4.1 Increased average selling prices 1.8 Operating segment and product category mix 0.2 Other (0.4 ) Year ended December 31, 2004 gross margin 73.8 % Decreased Centerpulse and Implex inventory step up charges as a percentage of net sales during 2004 ($59.4 million, or 2.0 percent of net sales) compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2003 ($42.7 million, or 6.1 percent of net sales) and increases in average selling prices were the primary contributors to improved gross margins. In addition, operating segment mix and product category mix both had a positive impact on gross margins due to higher sales growth in the more profitable Americas segment compared to Europe and Asia Pacific, higher sales growth of reconstructive implants and the continued shift to premium products. Offsetting these favorable impacts were a variety of other items, including increased royalty expenses and higher losses on foreign exchange contracts included in cost of products sold, partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs due to automation, vertical integration and process improvements. Operating Expenses R&D as a percentage of net sales was 5.6 percent for years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. R&D increased to $166.7 million from $105.8 million reflecting a full year of Centerpulse research and development expenses and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance. The Companys pipeline includes 146 projects with a total investment equal to or greater than $1 million. Of the 146 projects, approximately two thirds involve new platforms, MIS or other technologies. For example, the Companys orthobiological research group in Austin, Texas is developing innovative solutions for hip fracture and cartilage regeneration. During 2004, the Company delivered more than 40 major development projects to market. The Company has strategically targeted R&D spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of 4 6 percent for the industry. The Company expects over the next few years to invest in research and development at approximately 5.5 percent to 6 percent of sales. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 39.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 38.8 percent for the same 2003 period. Amortization expense increased to $39.1 million, or 1.3 percent of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $10.9 million, or less than 1 percent of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to amortization expense related to Centerpulse and Implex finite lived intangible assets. In addition, during 2004 the Company continued to introduce or expand strategic programs and activities. In 2004, The Zimmer Institute and its satellite locations were well utilized with over 1,400 surgeons trained, compared to 500 surgeons trained in 2003. These surgeon training costs are recognized in SG&A. The Company also recognized approximately $5 million of Sarbanes Oxley compliance expenses, including consultant fees and increased audit fees. These increases were partially offset by expense synergies realized from the Centerpulse acquisition and controlled spending. The Company has begun to realize synergies from the Centerpulse acquisition and expects to pursue additional synergy opportunities. The Company estimates that over the next two years it will be able to reduce annual SG&A as a percentage of net sales to 38.9 percent or lower, representing a 200 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2003 (the first quarter of combined Zimmer and Centerpulse operations). Acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Centerpulse and Implex were $81.1 million compared to $79.6 million for the same 2003 period and included $24.4 million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses, $24.2 million of integration consulting expenses, $9.4 million of employee severance and retention expenses, $7.8 million of professional fees, $5.2 million of personnel expenses and travel for full time integration team members, $4.3 million of costs related to integrating the Companys information technology systems, $2.9 million of costs related to relocation of facilities, and $2.9 million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 69 percent to $763.2 million from $450.7 million in the comparable 2003 period. Operating profit growth was driven by Zimmer standalone sales growth, operating profit contributed by Centerpulse, effectively controlled operating expenses and the absence of in process research and development expense in 2004 compared to $11.2 million in 2003. These favorable items were partially offset by Centerpulse and Implex inventory step up of $59.4 million in 2004 compared to $42.7 million in 2003 and intangible asset amortization of $39.1 million in 2004 versus $10.9 million in 2003. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to 25.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 33.6 percent for the same period in 2003. A major component of the decrease (4.7 percent, or $34.5 million) was the result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired Centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing Swiss tax rate. The major reasons 26 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K for the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate were the ongoing European restructuring initiatives, the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing Swiss tax rate (from approximately 24 percent to 12.5 percent) and continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings increased 57 percent to $541.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $346.3 million in the same 2003 period. The increase was due to higher operating profit offset partially by increased interest expense, $31.7 million in 2004 compared to $13.2 million in 2003. Net earnings for 2003 also included a one time, $55.1 million (net of tax), non cash cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for instruments. Net earnings in 2004 also benefited from the decreased effective income tax rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 33 percent and 34 percent to $2.22 and $2.19, respectively, from $1.67 and $1.64 in 2003.

Sales growth was driven by strong demand for the Companys reconstructive implants and additional sales from the October 2, 2003 Centerpulse acquisition. The 39 percent increase was comprised of a 20 percent increase in Zimmer standalone sales and a 19 percent increase due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Favorable demographics, including an aging population and a continued shift to premium priced products, contributed to the favorable volume and mix growth. Higher average selling prices were realized in all three geographic segments. The continued weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the Japanese yen were the main contributors to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. Net sales in the Americas for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 30 percent to $1,208.3 million. Sales growth was driven by strong demand for the Companys reconstructive implants and additional sales from the Centerpulse acquisition. The 30 percent increase was comprised of a 19 percent increase in Zimmer standalone sales plus an 11 percent increase due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Net sales of reconstructive implants increased 33 percent to $941.4 million, 22 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales and 11 percent related to the Centerpulse acquisition.

Hip sales increased 27 percent to $365.6 million, 21 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales and 6 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales growth was led by the NexGen Legacy Knee Posterior Stabilized product line, including the LPS Flex Knee, the NexGen Trabecular Metal Technology Tibial Components, the NexGen CR Knee with Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene and the NexGen Rotating Hinge Knee. Hip sales growth was driven by the continued conversion to porous stems including significant growth of the VerSys Fiber Metal Taper Stem, which is often used in MIS Hip Replacement Procedures; Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups; and increased sales of Trilogy Acetabular Cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Net sales in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 115 percent to $366.0 million. Sales growth was driven by additional sales from the Centerpulse acquisition and strong demand for the Companys reconstructive implants. The 115 percent increase was comprised of a 77 percent increase due to the Centerpulse acquisition and a 38 percent increase in Zimmer standalone sales. Net sales of reconstructive implants increased 119 percent to $329.8 million, 81 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition and 38 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, including 18 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Knee sales increased 72 percent to $162.8 million, 37 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition and 35 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, including 18 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

Net sales in Asia Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 21 percent to $326.7 million. Sales growth was driven by strong demand for the Companys reconstructive implants and additional sales from the Centerpulse acquisition. The 21 percent increase was comprised of a 14 percent increase in Zimmer standalone sales and a 7 percent increase due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Net sales of reconstructive implants increased 25 percent to $249.8 million, 14 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, including 9 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and 11 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales increased 21 percent to $114.2 million, 16 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, including 10 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and 5 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Hip sales increased 25 percent to $128.2 million, 13 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, 27 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K including 9 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and 12 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales were driven by the NexGen LPS Flex Knee, NexGen Trabecular Metal Technology Tibial Components and the NexGen CR Knee. Hip sales were driven primarily by the continued conversion to porous stems and sales of Trilogy Acetabular Cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. The following table presents the components of the 2003 over 2002 percentage changes in net sales by product category: Zimmer Standalone Impact of Volume/ Foreign Sub Centerpulse Net Mix Price Exchange Total Acquisition Change Reconstructive implants 16 % 3 % 4 % 23 % 20 % 43 % Trauma 4 3 3 10 3 13 Spine(1) N/A N/A Orthopaedic surgical products 5 2 3 10 10 Consolidated 13 3 4 20 19 39 Overall, worldwide reconstructive implant sales increased 43 percent to $1,521.0 million. The 43 percent increase was comprised of a 23 percent increase in Zimmer standalone sales and a 20 percent increase due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales increased 37 percent to $800.5 million, 24 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, including 4 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates and 13 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales were led by the NexGen Legacy Knee Posterior Stabilized product line including the LPS Flex Knee, NexGen Trabecular Metal Tibial Components and the NexGen CR Knee with Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene. Hip sales increased 46 percent to $645.6 million, 24 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition and 22 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, including 5 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Hip sales were driven by continued conversion to porous stems, Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups, and increased sales of Trilogy Acetabular Cups incorporating Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Dental sales were $29.8 million, reflecting solid growth in both standard and tapered SwissPlus Implants. Trauma sales increased 13 percent to $151.6 million, 10 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales, including 3 percent due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and 3 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Trauma sales were led by sales of the Zimmer Periarticular Plating System. Spine sales were $33.6 million due to sales from Centerpulse. OSP sales increased 10 percent, including 3 percent due to changes in foreign currency, to $194.8 million, primarily driven by the continued growth of the OrthoPAT Orthopedic Perioperative Autotransfusion System. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 72.8 percent in 2003 compared to 74.9 percent in 2002. Gross profit for 2003 was reduced $42.7 million, or 2.2 percent of net sales, as a result of an inventory step up charge recognized in connection with the Centerpulse acquisition. Sales and gross profit from Centerpulse also reduced reported gross margins as Centerpulse has a greater percentage of sales based in Europe, where gross margins are historically lower than the U.S. and Japan. Increased Zimmer standalone average selling prices in all geographic segments, the continued conversion from cemented implants to higher margin porous implants and the ongoing efforts to reduce manufacturing costs through automation, in sourcing and process improvements had positive impacts on gross profit. The Companys operating plans annually call for reductions in unit manufacturing cost of its products as a direct result of a number of factors, including but not limited to, increased volume, improvements in material technology, replacement of used machinery and equipment with higher speed equipment, changes in the configuration of manufacturing cells designed to increase throughput, labor automation as well as in sourcing. Focus on inventory cost reduction is a strategic imperative. The Company will continue to direct efforts on driving down costs of products sold, general and administrative expenses and holding costs associated with working capital. Research and development as a percentage of net sales was 5.6 percent in 2003 compared to 5.9 percent in 2002, as research and development expenses increased 31 percent from the prior year compared to a 39 percent increase in sales. Research and development expense increased to $105.8 million from $80.7 million reflecting research and development expenses from Centerpulse and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance, including MIS Technologies, innovative materials such as Trabecular Metal Technology and Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene, lifestyle designs, revision implants and biological solutions. The Company has strategically targeted R&D spending to be at the high end of what management believes to be an average of 4 6 percent for the industry. Maintaining a robust product development pipeline has enabled Zimmer to achieve significant contributions in revenue from new products, which management defines as products introduced within the prior 36 month period. For example, in the fourth quarter, new product revenue, excluding Centerpulse, represented 18.9 percent of sales, at the high end of the Companys stated quarterly and annual goal of 15 20 percent, in place since 1999. Management expects over the next year or two to continue to invest in R&D at almost 6 percent of sales on a higher revenue base as investments in spine, biologics and new technology increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percentage of net sales were 38.8 percent in 2003 compared to 39.8 percent (39.4 percent assuming the change in accounting principle for instruments is applied retroactively) in 2002. Low cost inflation accompanied with double digit revenue growth has driven the overall expense (1) Spine was a new product category as a result of the Centerpulse acquisition. 28 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K ratio lower for the year. Detailed planning, monitoring and control over these expenses have also contributed to the improvement. While well managed, the Company introduced programs and activities in 2003 that involved significant investments, which, in part, are reflected in SG&A. As an example, The Zimmer Institute saw very active use in 2003. The Zimmer Institute, which is used for surgeon training, product development activities such as prototype evaluations and product and instrument training for independent field sales representatives, provided training for over 500 surgeons, physician assistants and nurses on the MIS 2 Incision Hip Replacement Procedure and the MIS Quad Sparing Total Knee Procedure over the course of 2003. The cost of training is borne by the Company and reported in SG&A. The acquisition of Centerpulse resulted in higher SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2003. The change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted SG&A by $26.8 million, or 1.4 percent of net sales, in 2003. Acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisition of Centerpulse and InCentive were $79.6 million, including $36.1 million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses, $15.4 million of integration consulting expenses, $10.2 million of employee severance and retention expenses, $6.4 million of professional fees, $5.3 million of costs for meetings and activities associated with the initial cross training of employees and independent sales representatives, $2.4 million of investment banking fees incurred by Centerpulse, $2.0 million of personnel expenses and travel for full time integration team members, $0.6 million of employee relocation expenses and $1.2 million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses. Operating profit increased 12 percent to $450.7 million. Operating profit growth was driven by strong organic sales growth, operating profit contributed by Centerpulse and effectively controlled operating expenses. In addition, the change in accounting principle for instruments favorably impacted operating profit by $26.8 million. These favorable items were offset by Centerpulse inventory step up of $42.7 million, Centerpulse in process research and development write offs of $11.2 million and Centerpulse acquisition and integration expenses of $79.6 million. The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 33.6 percent, compared to 33.7 percent in 2002. The decrease from 33.7 percent to 33.6 percent was due to expanded operations in Puerto Rico and the implementation of certain business strategies in 2002 which resulted in reducing taxes in certain jurisdictions and increased credits, offset by non deductible in process research and development charges. Net earnings increased 34 percent to $346.3 million from $257.8 million in 2002, driven by strong organic sales growth, earnings contributed by Centerpulse, leveraged operating expenses and the one time, non cash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for instruments of $55.1 million (net of tax), offset by Centerpulse inventory step up of $28.0 million (net of tax), Centerpulse in process research and development write offs of $11.2 million and Centerpulse acquisition and integration expenses of $51.1 million (net of tax). Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 26 percent and 25 percent to $1.67 and $1.64, respectively, from $1.33 and $1.31 in 2002. OPERATING PROFIT BY SEGMENT Company management evaluates operating segment performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses, acquisition and integration expenses, inventory step up, in process research and development write offs and intangible asset amortization expense. Global operations include research, development engineering, medical education, brand management, corporate legal, finance, human resource functions and the Americas operations and logistics functions. For more information regarding the Companys segments, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. The following table sets forth the operating profit as a percentage of sales by segment for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Percent of net sales Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Americas 51.3 % 51.2 % 48.3 % Europe 34.6 26.3 24.4 Asia Pacific 42.3 45.3 46.1 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales improved slightly due to improved gross margins and controlled operating expenses. Gross profit margins increased as a result of improved average selling prices, lower royalty expenses as a percentage of net sales and the impact of a more favorable product sales mix. Product sales mix made favorable contributions as the Company sold a higher concentration of more profitable reconstructive implants and spinal implants, while less profitable trauma and OSP products became a smaller percentage of net sales. Royalties as a percentage of net sales declined as certain royalty contracts have fixed components and caps, or ceilings, on payments. In addition to improved gross margins, the Company effectively controlled operating expenses, including general and administrative expenses. These improvements were offset primarily by increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain distributor contracts. In Europe, operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved due to improved gross margins, controlled operating expenses and the favorable impact of the Centerpulse acquisition. Gross profit margins increased principally due to improved average selling prices, a more favorable product and country sales mix and the favorable impact of the Centerpulse acquisition. Product sales mix made favorable contributions as the Company sold a higher concentration of more profitable reconstructive implants and 29 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K spinal implants, while less profitable trauma and OSP products became a smaller percentage of net sales. Country sales mix made favorable contributions as the profitable German market represented a greater percentage of total Europe sales. Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales declined primarily due to decreased average selling prices, principally the result of the 4.9 percent decrease in government reimbursement rates in Japan, and increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain dealer contracts in Japan. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Operating profit for the Americas as a percentage of net sales increased due to improved gross margins driven by higher average selling prices and increased sales of higher margin products, leveraged operating expenses and the favorable impact of the change in accounting principle for instruments. The change in accounting principle for instruments increased operating profit by 1.7 percentage points. With respect to sales growth, increased Zimmer standalone average selling prices of 4 percent in 2003 and favorable effects of volume and mix, 15 percent increase in 2003, represent the most significant factors in improved operating profit in the Americas. As reconstructive implant sales grow at a higher rate than trauma and OSP, operating profit margins generally tend to improve since reconstructive product sales generally earn higher gross margins. This was the case in 2003, with Zimmer standalone reconstructive implant sales growth of 22 percent as compared with total Zimmer standalone sales growth of 19 percent. In the fourth quarter, the Company reported operating profit as a percent of net sales of 50.4 percent for the Americas. Operating profit for Europe as a percentage of net sales increased due to improved gross profit margins driven by higher Zimmer standalone average selling prices and favorable product and country mix, leveraged operating expenses and the favorable impact of the change in accounting principle for instruments. The change in accounting for instruments increased operating profit by 1.4 percentage points. Increases in Zimmer standalone average selling prices in Europe of 2 percent in 2003 and the effect of volume and mix, 19 percent increase in 2003, were the key factors in improved operating profit. Also contributing to the improvement was significantly lower growth in operating expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reported operating profit as a percent of net sales of 24.7 percent for Europe. Operating profit for Asia Pacific as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to less favorable rates on hedge contracts during the year compared to the prior year, partially offset by increased Zimmer standalone average selling prices and leveraged operating expenses. The change in accounting for instruments had an immaterial effect on operating profit for Asia Pacific. Increases in Zimmer standalone average selling prices in Asia Pacific of 1 percent and volume and mix improvements of 4 percent in 2003 contributed modest improvement but was offset by higher cost of products sold. Included in cost of product sold are losses on foreign exchange hedge contracts, which increased in 2003 relative to 2002. In the fourth quarter, the Company reported operating profit as a percent of net sales of 47.1 percent for Asia Pacific. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $862.2 million in 2004 compared to $494.8 million in 2003. The principal source of cash was net earnings of $541.8 million. Non cash expenses for the period included depreciation and amortization expense of $181.3 million and Centerpulse and Implex inventory step up of $59.4 million. Included in operating cash flow is approximately $112 million of payments related to the Centerpulse and Implex integration. Income taxes generated $139.2 million of operating cash flow, primarily due to reduced U.S. federal income tax payments resulting from the utilization of acquired Centerpulse net operating losses and exercises of stock options by Company employees, which are deductible expenses in the U.S. In addition, during 2004 the Company received a $55 million tax refund related to the overpayment of U.S. federal income taxes during 2003. Working capital, including the management of inventory and accounts receivable, continues to be a key management focus. At December 31, 2004, the Company had 59 days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable, favorable to December 31, 2003 by 3 days and unfavorable to December 31, 2002 by 7 days. Acquired Centerpulse businesses accounted for the decline from December 31, 2002, as Centerpulses business mix has a greater proportion of European sales with payment terms generally longer than those in the U.S. The improvement from the prior year is due to the Europe operating segment reducing its days of sales outstanding by 6 days due to improved collections in larger markets, such as Germany and France, and the factoring of receivables in Italy. At December 31, 2004, the Company had 258 days of inventory on hand, unfavorable to the prior year by 26 days. Inventory balances have increased due to the acquisition of Implex and to support new product launches. The 258 days of inventory on hand at December 31, 2004 is in line with the Companys anticipated levels of 250 260 days. Cash flows used in investing activities declined to $388.3 million in 2004 compared to $1,102.7 million in 2003. During 2003 the Company made $927.7 million of cash payments, net of acquired cash, for the Centerpulse and InCentive Capital acquisitions, compared to $18.2 million during 2004 to complete the compulsory acquisition process. During 2004 the Company also completed the acquisition of Implex for cash consideration of $153.1 million, comprised of $98.6 million of initial cash consideration, earn out payments of $51.9 million and direct acquisition costs of $2.6 million. Additions to other property, plant and equipment during 2004 were $100.8 million compared to $44.9 million in 2003. Increases were primarily to support the acquired Centerpulse businesses, to support sales growth and new product 30 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K launches and to fund the facility expansions in Warsaw, Indiana, Ponce, Puerto Rico, and Parsippany, New Jersey. Additions to instruments during 2004 were $139.6 million compared to $113.6 million in 2003. Increases in instrument purchases were primarily to support acquired Centerpulse businesses and to support new product launches. Also, additional instrument purchases were made during 2004 to support MIS Procedure growth, including the placement of over 2,000 MIS Quad Sparing Knee Replacement and Mini Incision Knee Replacement instrument sets in the field. During 2005 the Company expects purchases of other property, plant and equipment to increase to approximately $125 million to $135 million, as a result of ongoing facility expansions in Warsaw, Indiana, Ponce, Puerto Rico, Winterthur, Switzerland and Parsippany, New Jersey. Facility expansions are due to increased demand, the closure of the Austin, Texas, facility and the tripling of Trabecular Metal Technology production capacity. During 2005 the Company expects purchases of instruments to be approximately $145 million to $150 million as the Company continues to invest in instruments to support new products, sales growth and MIS procedures. Cash flows used in financing activities were $402.0 million in 2004 compared to $664.8 million provided by financing activities in 2003. The Company repaid $461.4 million of debt in 2004 utilizing cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and $65.0 million in cash proceeds received from the exercise of Company stock options. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has the following committed financing arrangements: (i) $400 million 364 day revolving credit facility maturing May 2005, (ii) $800 million three year revolving credit facility maturing June 2006 and (iii) $550 million five year term loan facility maturing June 2008 (collectively, the Senior Credit Facility). Available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2004, were approximately $1.1 billion. On May 24, 2004, the Company renewed its $400 million 364 day revolving credit facility and amended its five year term loan facility to $550 million and reduced its term loan pricing by 25 basis points. The Company and certain of its wholly owned foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers and its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors of the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings may bear interest at the appropriate LIBOR based rate, or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin determined by reference to the Companys senior unsecured long term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets, as defined in the Senior Credit Facility. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If the Company falls below an investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments and payment of dividends, as defined in the Senior Credit Facility. The Company intends to maintain a capital structure that is consistent with an investment grade credit rating. The Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2004. Commitments under the $400 million 364 day revolving credit facility and the $800 million three year revolving credit facility are subject to certain fees, including a facility and a utilization fee. The Company also has available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $50 million. The terms of the Implex acquisition include additional cash earn out payments that are contingent on the year over year growth of Implex product sales through 2006. The Company estimates total earn out payments, including payments already made, to be in a range from $120 to $160 million. The Company expects to pay future earn out payments, if any, with cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its Senior Credit Facility. The Company had $154.6 million in cash and equivalents, $18.9 million in restricted cash and total debt of $651.5 million as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, $70.2 million of cash and equivalents was held at Company locations outside the U.S. The Company expects cash on hand to be in excess of total outstanding debt by June 30, 2006, absent any cash requirements for acquisitions. Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet the Companys working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise, the Company believes that its earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow the Company to obtain additional capital, if necessary. 31 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company has entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments. The following table illustrates the Companys contractual obligations: 2006 2008 2010 and and and Contractual Obligations Total 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter Debt obligations $ 651.5 $ 27.5 $ 449.0 $ 175.0 $ Operating leases 103.0 23.5 34.2 17.7 27.6 Purchase obligations 16.1 15.5 0.6 Other long term liabilities 420.9 135.7 30.5 254.7 Total contractual obligations $ 1,191.5 $ 66.5 $ 619.5 $ 223.2 $ 282.3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The financial results of the Company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below. Excess Inventory and Instruments The Company must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of its inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost. Similarly, the Company must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of reserves, the Company evaluates current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of its products and instrument systems and components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis. Income Taxes The Company estimates income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on the Companys ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. The Company evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. The Company operates within numerous taxing jurisdictions. The Company is subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. The Company makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense, liabilities and reserves. The Company believes adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit. Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related fees and for claims incurred but not reported. An actuarial model is used by the Company to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. The amounts established represent managements best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. Changes to these assumptions could result in the Company being required to record impairment charges on these assets. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein under Item 8. 32 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities, and on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars. The Company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows the Company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. In order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. These forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. The notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts, principally Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars, entered into with third parties, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were $1,052 million and $506 million, respectively. For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004, the Company has an obligation to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars or purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2005 through December 2006. The weighted average contract rates outstanding are Euro: USD 1.20, USD: Swiss Franc 1.25, USD: Yen 110, British Pound: USD 1.76, USD: Canadian Dollar 1.37 and Australian Dollar: USD 0.65. The Company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities. The Companys policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of its risk management program, the Company also performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2004, indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2007, depending on the direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of $62.1 million, $21.8 million, $20.3 million, $6.3 million, $4.4 million and $3.7 million for the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar contracts, respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign exchange contracts would not subject the Company to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. The Company had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $1,860 million at December 31, 2004, primarily in Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately $1,140 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2004 relates to goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments. The Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. As a result, foreign currency translation gains/ losses recognized in earnings under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation are generally offset with gain/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. COMMODITY PRICE RISK The Company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. The Company enters into 12 to 24 month supply contracts, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices. As part of the Companys risk management program, sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 33 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2004 FORM 10 K INTEREST RATE RISK In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities. Presently, the Company invests its cash and equivalents in money market and investment grade short term debt instruments. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk. Currently, the Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. The Companys exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with its credit facilities. The Company is subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and its uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of its debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates. The Company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure, but may do so in the future. Based upon the Companys overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2004, a change of 10 percent in interest rates (or 25 basis points), assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would result in an annual increase of interest expense of approximately $1.0 million. However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no such action, nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes. Further, this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts receivable. The Company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments, and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. The Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and equivalents and investments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which it conducts business. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the Company. The Company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines. The Company does not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. However, essentially all of the Companys trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and health care systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures and the Company believes that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk. 34 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.
