ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. This discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements. OVERVIEW We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products (sometimes referred to in this report as OSP). Reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the bodys natural healing process. OSP include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post operation rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 24 countries and market products in more than 100 countries. We manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. We believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005. Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 9 percentage points of sales growth, which is the same as 2004 sales growth when compared to 2003 on a pro forma7 basis. We believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit rates driven by an aging global population, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques (such as our MIS Procedures and Technologies) and more active lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the continued shift in demand to premium products, such as Longevity, Durasul and Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes, Trabecular Metal Technology products, high flex knees, knee revision products and porous hip stems, continue to positively affect sales growth. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2005, sales of products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology were over $100 million, an increase of nearly 40 percent over 2004. We believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry. We have made significant progress in the development and introduction of MIS Implants, Procedures and Technologies. During the year ended December 31, 2005, The Zimmer Institute and its satellite locations trained nearly 2,500 surgeons on advanced techniques, including over 2,200 surgeons on MIS Procedures, which is approximately 70 percent greater than the number of surgeons trained last year. Pricing Trends Selling price increases contributed 1 percentage point of sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2 percentage points in 2004 when compared to 2003 on a pro forma basis. The reduced benefit from selling price increases in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributed to the Americas operating segment. The Americas experienced a 1 percent increase in selling prices during the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to a 4 percent increase in 2004 on a pro forma basis. We believe the slower growth in selling price increases was primarily due to hospital cost containment efforts. In Europe, selling prices for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased 1 percent, compared to a negligible effect in 2004 on a pro forma basis. Within Europe, Germany, which constitutes approximately 6 percent of our sales, experienced a 5 percent decrease in selling prices in the year ended December 31, 2005, as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates. The decline in Germany was partially offset by increased selling prices in other European markets. Asia Pacific selling prices had a negligible effect on sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to a 2 percent decrease in 2004 on a pro forma basis. Effective April 1, 2004, the Japanese government reduced reimbursement rates, which contributed to a reduction of our selling prices in Japan by approximately 4 percent during the year ended December 31, 2004, on a pro forma basis. The negative effect of this decrease in Japan occurred only in the first quarter of 2005, as the anniversary of the price reductions was April 1, 2005. Japan represents approximately 9 percent of our sales. The next Japanese reimbursement change is expected to be April 1, 2006, and therefore, we expect Japanese selling prices to remain the same through the first quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year. We expect the Japanese government to reduce reimbursement rates again at that time. We estimate this reduction will affect Japan sales negatively by approximately 5 percent for the year ending December 31, 2006, based upon Zimmer Japans portfolio of reconstructive and trauma products. With pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and group purchasing organizations, we estimate 7 The unaudited pro forma net sales information for 2003, including comparisons to 2004 net sales, contained in this Form 10 K and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles has been derived from the audited financial statements of Zimmer Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the financial statements of Centerpulse for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 to give effect to the Centerpulse acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2003. 24 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2005 FORM 10 K global sales could decline by approximately 1 percent in 2006 due to selling price decreases. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates For the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on global sales growth. However, a stronger U.S. Dollar compared to most foreign currencies in the three month period ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same 2004 period, decreased sales by 3 percentage points. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates, we estimate that weaker foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect of approximately 1 percent on sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities, and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal. New Product Sales New products, which management defines as products or stock keeping units (SKUs) introduced within the prior 36 month period to a particular market, accounted for 21 percent, or $695 million, of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2005. Adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of industry performance. Our sales have grown with the introduction of new products, such as Trabecular Metal Modular Acetabular Cups, certain SKUs of the NexGen Complete Knee Solution for the LPS, LPS Flex, and CR Flex Knees, and the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System. We believe new products in our current pipeline should continue to favorably affect our operating performance. Products we expect to contribute to new product sales in 2006 include products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology, including a hip stem and humeral shoulder, the VerSys Epoch Composite Full Coat Hip Prosthesis, the NexGen MIS Tibial Plate, various trauma products including new Zimmer Periarticular Locking Plates and the Sirus Intramedullary Nail System released to the U.S. market, and alternative bearing surfaces including ceramic on ceramic and metal on metal. Acquisition of Centerpulse We are near completion of our integration plan for Centerpulse. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we ceased manufacturing operations at our Austin, Texas facility. Remaining integration milestones relate to IT systems conversions, primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific, the residual costs of decommissioning the Austin facility and disposing of this asset, continued in sourcing and a few miscellaneous items. We expect to complete the integration plan for Centerpulse by the end of 2006. Net synergies associated with the acquisition and integration of Centerpulse were approximately $63 million in 2005. We define net synergies as expense synergies less operating profit reductions resulting from integration related sales losses and increases in operating expenses directly resulting from the acquisition. With the majority of our manufacturing integration plan completed, additional expense synergies should be realized in 2006 and 2007 as the inventory produced after the completion of the integration plan is sold. Operating expense synergies, principally in selling, general and administrative expenses, have exceeded our original expectations, reflecting more rapid than expected execution and achievement of operational efficiencies. We estimate our integration related sales losses and increased operating expenses were approximately $28 million in 2005. Expense synergies for 2006 are expected to be in excess of $100 million. We expect these synergies will be slightly offset by sales losses and increased operating expenses. We incurred $56.6 million of acquisition and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005, and expect to incur $12 $15 million of acquisition and integration expenses in 2006. Acquisition of Implex We completed the acquisition of Implex on April 23, 2004. We had a strategic alliance with Implex since 2000 for the development and distribution of reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology. Pursuant to the strategic alliance, we sold products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology, which represented over 90 percent of Implex sales. New Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. We adopted this accounting standard using the prospective method and will not restate prior periods. We estimate the adoption of this accounting standard will reduce diluted earnings per share by $0.23 $0.25 during the year ended December 31, 2006. However, this is a non cash expense and will not have an effect on our net cash flows. 25 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 77.5 percent in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 73.8 percent in 2004. The following table reconciles the gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year ended December 31, 2004 gross margin 73.8 % Inventory step up charge 1.8 Improved inventory management 0.8 Increased selling prices 0.2 Resolution of certain legal and other matters 0.2 Other 0.7 Year ended December 31, 2005 gross margin 77.5 % Inventory step up costs in the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased to $5.0 million, or 0.2 percent of sales, compared to $59.4 million, or 2.0 percent of sales, in 2004. We define inventory step up as the difference between the cost basis and the fair value of acquired Centerpulse and Implex inventories. Other primary contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were reduced inventory charges due to improved inventory management, increased selling prices, favorable resolution of certain legal and other matters and reduced royalties. Royalty expenses as a percentage of sales declined due to a favorable mix of non royalty bearing sales. Operating Expenses R&D as a percentage of net sales was 5.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 5.6 percent in 2004. R&D increased to $175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $166.7 million in 2004, reflecting increased spending on projects focused on areas of strategic significance, including orthobiologics. In 2005, we doubled the number of internal people and project related orthobiological investments. Currently, our product pipeline consists of more than 160 active projects. We are also investing in MIS Procedures and Technologies, material technologies, including woven materials and drug/device combinations and intelligence technologies, including sensor technology. We delivered more than 79 projects to the market in 2005. We target R&D spending to the high end of what management believes to be an average of 4 6 percent for the industry. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 38.3 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to 39.9 percent in 2004. The decrease was primarily due to sales growth and realized expense synergies. In addition, lower product liability claims and well controlled general and administrative spending reduced SG&A as a percentage of sales. Acquisition, integration and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $56.6 million compared to $81.1 million in 2004, and included $13.3 million of employee severance and retention expenses, $12.7 million of sales agent contract termination expenses, $6.9 million of costs related to integrating our information technology systems, $6.2 million of facility relocation expenses, $5.6 million of integration consulting expenses, $3.2 million related to the impairment loss on the Austin facility, $3.1 million of personnel expenses and travel for full time integration team members and $5.6 million of other expenses. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased 38 percent to $1,055.0 million, from $763.2 million in 2004. Increased sales, improved gross profit margins, realized operating expense synergies, controlled operating expenses and decreased acquisition and integration expenses drove operating profit. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to 29.5 percent for the year ended December 31, 2005, from 25.9 percent in 2004. The provision for income taxes in 2004 included a $34.5 million benefit (4.7 percent) as a result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired Centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing Swiss tax rate. Exclusive of this one time benefit in the provision for income taxes, we were able to realize a lower effective tax rate. The reasons for the lower effective tax rate were the implementation of several European restructuring initiatives, the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing Swiss tax rate (from approximately 24 percent to 12.5 percent) and the continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico. In 2004, the successful negotiation of the lower Swiss tax rate was effective for the last five months of the year, whereas in 2005 the benefit was recognized for the entire year. Net earnings increased 35 percent to $732.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $541.8 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher operating profit and decreased interest expense due to a lower average outstanding debt balance, offset by a higher effective tax rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 33 and 34 percent to $2.96 and $2.93, respectively, from $2.22 and $2.19 in 2004. 28 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

The following table reconciles the gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the three month period ended December 31, 2003. Three month period ended December 31, 2003 gross margin 68.1 % Inventory step up charge 4.1 Increased selling prices 1.8 Operating segment and product category mix 0.2 Other (0.4 ) Year ended December 31, 2004 gross margin 73.8 % Decreased Centerpulse and Implex inventory step up charges as a percentage of net sales during 2004 ($59.4 million, or 2.0 percent of net sales) compared to the three month period ended December 31, 2003 ($42.7 million, or 6.1 percent of net sales) and increases in selling prices were the primary contributors to improved gross margins. In addition, operating segment mix and product category mix both had a positive effect on gross margins due to higher sales growth in the more profitable Americas segment compared to Europe and Asia Pacific, higher sales growth of reconstructive implants and the continued shift to premium products. Offsetting these favorable effects were a variety of other items, including increased royalty expenses and higher losses on foreign exchange contracts included in cost of products sold, partially offset by reduced manufacturing costs due to automation, vertical integration and process improvements. Operating Expenses R&D as a percentage of net sales was 5.6 percent for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. R&D increased to $166.7 million from $105.8 million, reflecting a full year of Centerpulse research and development expenses and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of strategic significance. During 2004, we delivered more than 40 major development projects to market. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 39.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 38.8 percent for the same 2003 period. Amortization expense increased to $39.1 million, or 1.3 percent of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $10.9 million, or less than 1 percent of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to amortization expense related to Centerpulse and Implex finite lived intangible assets. In addition, during 2004 we continued to introduce or expand strategic programs and activities. In 2004, The Zimmer Institute and its satellite locations were well utilized with over 1,400 surgeons trained, compared to 500 surgeons trained in 2003. These surgeon training costs are recognized in SG&A. We also recognized approximately $5 million of Sarbanes Oxley compliance expenses, including consultant fees and increased audit fees. These increases were partially offset by expense synergies realized from the Centerpulse acquisition and controlled spending. Acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Centerpulse and Implex were $81.1 million compared to $79.6 million for the same 2003 period and included $24.4 million of sales agent and lease contract termination expenses, $24.2 million of integration consulting expenses, $9.4 million of employee severance and retention expenses, $7.8 million of professional fees, $5.2 million of personnel expenses and travel for full time integration team members, $4.3 million of costs related to integrating our information technology systems, $2.9 million of costs related to relocation of facilities, and $2.9 million of other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased 69 percent to $763.2 million from $450.7 million in the comparable 2003 period. Operating profit growth was driven by Zimmer standalone sales growth, operating profit 31 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2005 FORM 10 K contributed by Centerpulse, effectively controlled operating expenses and the absence of in process research and development expense in 2004 compared to $11.2 million in 2003. These favorable items were partially offset by Centerpulse and Implex inventory step up of $59.4 million in 2004 compared to $42.7 million in 2003 and intangible asset amortization of $39.1 million in 2004 versus $10.9 million in 2003. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle decreased to 25.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 33.6 percent for the same period in 2003. A major component of the decrease (4.7 percent, or $34.5 million) was the result of revaluing deferred taxes of acquired Centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the ongoing Swiss tax rate. The major reasons for the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate were the ongoing European restructuring initiatives, the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing Swiss tax rate (from approximately 24 percent to 12.5 percent) and continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings increased 57 percent to $541.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $346.3 million in the same 2003 period. The increase was due to higher operating profit offset partially by increased interest expense, $31.7 million in 2004 compared to $13.2 million in 2003. Net earnings for 2003 also included a one time, $55.1 million (net of tax), non cash cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for instruments. Net earnings in 2004 also benefited from the decreased effective income tax rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 33 percent and 34 percent to $2.22 and $2.19, respectively, from $1.67 and $1.64 in 2003. OPERATING PROFIT BY SEGMENT Management evaluates operating segment performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses, acquisition, integration and other expenses, inventory step up, in process research and development write offs and intangible asset amortization expense. Global operations include research, development engineering, medical education, brand management, corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and U.S. and Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and logistics. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from segment operating profit. For more information regarding our segments, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following table sets forth the operating profit as a percentage of sales by segment for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Percent of net sales Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Americas 52.6 % 51.3 % 51.2 % Europe 36.3 35.1 26.3 Asia Pacific 45.2 42.3 45.3 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased due to product category mix and the effective control of operating expenses, including realized expense synergies and controlled general and administrative spending. European operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved due to the realization of expense synergies related to the elimination of redundant functions and controlled selling, general and administrative spending. Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to product category mix, lower royalty expenses as a percentage of sales and improved inventory management. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales improved slightly due to improved selling prices, lower royalty expenses as a percentage of net sales, product category mix and controlled operating expenses. Increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain distributor contracts partially offset these improvements. In Europe, operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved due to improved selling prices, product category mix, country sales mix, controlled operating expenses and the favorable effect of the Centerpulse acquisition. Country sales mix made favorable contributions as the more profitable German market represented a greater percentage of total Europe sales. Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales declined primarily due to decreased selling prices, principally the result of the decrease in government reimbursement rates in Japan, and increased selling expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain dealer contracts in Japan. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $878.2 million in 2005 compared to $862.2 million in 2004. The principal source of cash was net earnings of $732.5 million. We experienced $119.3 million of positive cash flow related to income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to the utilization of acquired Centerpulse tax attributes, the utilization of foreign tax credits, the realization of certain state/local tax incentives and exercises of employee stock options. Operating cash flows from working capital decreased compared to the 2004 period as a result of sales growth, payment of acquisition and integration related expenses and resolution of certain legal and product liability matters. Working capital management continues to be a key focus. At December 31, 2005, we had 56 days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable, favorable to December 31, 2004 by 3 days. The improvement was achieved through improvement in all reporting segments. At December 31, 2005, we had 32 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2005 FORM 10 K 283 days of inventory on hand, unfavorable to December 31, 2004 by 28 days. Our inventory levels have increased due to new products, higher purchases of raw materials in advance of expected increases of raw material prices and inventory build up to accommodate the Austin facility shut down. Cash flows used in investing activities were $311.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $388.3 million in 2004. In 2005, we paid $44.1 million pursuant to the terms of the Implex acquisition agreement for contingent earn out payments. Additions to instruments during the year ended December 31, 2005 were $150.0 million compared to $139.6 million in 2004. Increases in instrument purchases were primarily to support new product launches and sales growth. In 2006, we expect purchases of instruments to approximate $110 $115 million as we continue to invest in instruments to support new products, sales growth and MIS Procedures. The anticipated decrease in instrument purchases compared to 2005 is the result of high rates of penetration already achieved with MIS instruments across our broad base of customers. Additionally, we have been able to successfully in source instruments at a lower cost. Additions to other property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2005 were $105.3 million compared to $100.8 million in 2004. Increases were related to facility expansions in Warsaw, Indiana; Ponce, Puerto Rico; and Parsippany, New Jersey. Facility expansions were due to increased demand, the transfer of production to our other manufacturing sites as a result of the closure of the Austin, Texas facility and the tripling of Trabecular Metal Technology production capacity. During 2006, we expect purchases of other property, plant and equipment to approximate $140 $150 million, as a result of ongoing facility expansions in Warsaw, Indiana, new information technology systems and further productivity related investments. Cash flows used in financing activities were $484.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to $402.0 million in 2004. We repaid $555.3 million of debt, net, in the year ended December 31, 2005, utilizing cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and $76.7 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans. Additionally, in December our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program which resulted in the repurchase of $4.1 million of common stock in 2005. We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing March 31, 2010 (the Senior Credit Facility). We had $81.6 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2005, and therefore, our available borrowings were $1,268.4 million. The $81.6 million is in Japan and carries a low interest rate, which is why we have not repaid the debt. The Senior Credit Facility contains a provision whereby borrowings may be increased to $1,750 million. We and certain of our wholly owned foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers and our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors of the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a LIBOR based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2005. Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a facility and a utilization fee. The Senior Credit Facility is rated BBB+ by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and is not rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $65 million. The terms of the Implex acquisition include additional cash earn out payments that are contingent on the year over year growth of Implex product sales through 2006. We have paid $96.0 million of earn out payments through December 31, 2005. We estimate remaining payments, which will occur in 2006, to be in a range from $30 million to $40 million. In December, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion through December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2005, $4.1 million of common stock had been repurchased. We may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under this program. Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary. 33 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2005 FORM 10 K CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions): 2007 2009 and and 2011 and Contractual Obligations Total 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter Long term debt $ 81.6 $ $ $ 81.6 $ Operating leases 112.3 26.8 39.1 21.0 25.4 Purchase Obligations 22.5 22.1 0.4 Other long term liabilities 348.3 83.9 32.6 231.8 Total contractual obligations $ 564.7 $ 48.9 $ 123.4 $ 135.2 $ 257.2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below. Excess Inventory and Instruments We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis. Income Taxes We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. We operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense, liabilities and reserves. We believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit. Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. The amounts established represent managements best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this report under Item 8. 34 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2005 FORM 10 K ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities, and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. These forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars or purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2006 through May 2008. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were $1,142 million and $861 million, respectively. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were $195 million and $191 million, respectively. The weighted average contract rates outstanding are Euro: USD 1.26, USD: Swiss Franc 1.20, USD: Japanese Yen 102, British Pound: USD 1.79, USD: Canadian Dollar 1.22 and Australian Dollar: USD 0.73. We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2009, depending on the direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of $67.4 million, $21.2 million, $20.0 million, $11.2 million, $6.9 million and $5.9 million for the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar contracts, respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $1,775 million at December 31, 2005, primarily in Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately $1,003 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2005 relates to goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. As a result, foreign currency translation gains/losses recognized in earnings under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation are generally offset with gain/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into 12 to 24 month supply contracts, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2005 FORM 10 K INTEREST RATE RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities. Presently, we invest our cash and equivalents in money market and investment grade short term debt instruments. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities. We are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and our uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of our debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates. We currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure, but may do so in the future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2005, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on interest expense. However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no such action, nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes. Further, this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments, and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments. We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines. We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. However, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and health care systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk. 36 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 2005 FORM 10 K Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, the Companys internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 37 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.
