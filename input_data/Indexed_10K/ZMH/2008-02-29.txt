ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products (sometimes referred to in this report as OSP). We also provide other healthcare related services. Reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the bodys natural healing process. OSP include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post operation rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries. We manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2006 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. We believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007. Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 9 percentage points of 2007 sales growth, which is 2 percentage points above the rate of growth from 2006 compared to 2005. We believe orthopaedic procedure volume on a global basis will continue to rise at mid single digit rates driven by an aging global population, obesity and more active lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the continued shift in demand to premium products, such as Longevity, Durasul and Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes, Trabecular Metal Technology products, high flex knees, knee revision products and porous hip stems, continue to positively affect sales growth. For example, during 2007, sales of products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology were over $210 million, a year over year increase of over 26 percent. We believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly affect the orthopaedics industry. In 2007, we acquired ORTHOsoft Inc., a market leader in surgical navigation in orthopaedics. Combined with our SmartTools strategic initiative, we are focused on becoming a leader in operating room efficiency and enhancing surgical outcomes through the use of innovative navigation devices and cutting tools. We continued our significant progress in the development and introduction of MIS Implants, Procedures and Technologies. During the year ended December 31, 2007, The Zimmer Institute trained nearly 1,700 surgeons on advanced techniques, including approximately 850 surgeons on MIS Procedures. We believe innovative products will continue to affect the orthopaedics industry. In the second half of 2006, we launched the Zimmer Gender Solutions High Flex Knee Femoral Implant. High Flex Knees now make up approximately 44 percent of our total femoral unit sales on a global basis, having grown from approximately 28 percent prior to the launch of the Zimmer Gender Solutions Knee. Pricing Trends Selling prices were flat during 2007 compared to a modest increase during 2006 when compared to 2005. Asia Pacific selling prices decreased 1 percentage point for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to a 2 percent decrease in 2006 when compared to 2005. As anticipated, the Japanese government reduced reimbursement rates during 2007. This action affected sales in Japan negatively by approximately 5 percent for 2007, while other Asia Pacific markets were flat to positive. Japan represents approximately 7 percent of our sales. The Americas experienced a 1 percent increase in selling prices during 2007, compared to a 2 percent increase in 2006. In Europe, selling prices for 2007 decreased 1 percent, the same decrease we saw in 2006 as compared to 2005. Within Europe, Germany and Italy reported decreases in average selling prices of 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively, in 2007, as a result of reductions in government implant reimbursement rates and group purchasing arrangements while most other European markets were positive to flat. Germany and Italy combined represent approximately 11 percent of our sales. With the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and pressure from group purchasing organizations, global selling prices are expected to remain flat in 2008. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates For 2007, foreign currency exchange rates had a positive 3 percent effect on global sales growth. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates, we estimate that the weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2008 of approximately 2 percent on sales. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities, and under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts, which are 23 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal. New Product Sales New products, which we define as products or stock keeping units (SKUs) introduced within the prior 36 month period to a particular market, accounted for 25 percent, or $961 million, of 2007 sales. Adoption rates for new technologies are a key indicator of performance in our industry. Our sales have grown with the introduction of new products, such as Trabecular Metal Modular Acetabular Cups, certain SKUs of the NexGen Complete Knee Solution including the Gender Solutions Knee Femoral Implant for the LPS Flex and CR Flex Knees, the Dynesys4 Dynamic Stabilization System, the Zimmer M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis and PALACOS5 Bone Cement. We believe new products in our current pipeline should continue to favorably affect our operating performance. Products we expect to contribute to new product sales in 2008 include the Gender Solutions Knee Femoral Implant; Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System; products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology, including the Trabecular Metal Primary Hip Prosthesis, Trabecular Metal Acetabular Revision System and Trabecular Metal Spine Implants; Zimmer M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with Kinectiv Technology, Durom Acetabular Cups with Metasul LDH Large Diameter Heads; Versys Epoch Composite Hip Prosthesis; Zimmer Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System; Anatomical Shoulder Inverse/Reverse System; Zimmer MIS Femoral Nailing Solutions; NCB Locking Plate System; and CopiOs Bone Void Filler6. Acquisitions In April 2007, we acquired Endius Incorporated, a privately held spinal products company for an aggregate value of approximately $80 million in cash, before adjustments for debt repayment and other items. In November 2007, we acquired ORTHOsoft Inc., a leader in computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery, in a cash transaction for an aggregate value of approximately $50 million. Settlement of Department of Justice Investigation On September 27, 2007, we and other major U.S. Orthopaedic manufacturers reached a settlement with the United States government to resolve all claims related to an ongoing investigation into financial relationships between the industry and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. As part of the settlement, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the United States Attorneys Office for the District of New Jersey. Under the provisions of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we are subject to oversight by a federal monitor selected by the U.S. Attorney for a period of 18 months. We expect to continue to incur costs of approximately $6 9 million per quarter, to comply with the Deferred Prosecution Agreement through the remainder of the 18 month period. We settled civil and administrative claims related to the federal investigation for a cash payment to the United States government of $169.5 million. We recorded a $169.5 million expense during the third quarter in connection with the settlement. We also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has a term of 5 years. For more information regarding the settlement, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. New Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal, state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impacts of these expected settlements of $102.1 million, as well as a separate accrued interest liability of $1.7 million. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we are required to present the different components of such liability gross versus the historical net presentation. The adoption resulted in the tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by $6.4 million as of January 1, 2007. This decrease in the tax liability resulted in a reduction to retained earnings of $4.8 million, a reduction in goodwill of $61.4 million, the establishment of a tax receivable of $58.2 million, and the addition of an interest/penalty payable of $7.9 million, all as of January 1, 2007. 2008 Outlook Our operating profit for 2008 will be affected by the costs we will incur to implement a number of recently announced initiatives that we believe will position us to respond better to the changing needs of the healthcare market. Additionally, during 2008 we expect to incur costs of approximately $6 9 million per quarter to comply with the Deferred Prosecution 4 The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization Spinal System is indicated for use as an adjunct to fusion in the U.S. 5 PALACOS is a trademark of Heraeus Kulzer GmbH 6 Manufactured by Kensey Nash Corporation 24 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Agreement. The infrastructure and operating initiatives we plan to implement in 2008 include: Continuing to enhance our Corporate Compliance Program and to apply these enhancements to all business segments; Opening a new manufacturing facility in Ireland that will add an additional 100,000 square feet of international manufacturing capacity; Improving our quality system infrastructure; Investing in our global information technology systems, including improving our field based U.S. inventory and instrument tracking systems; Increasing instrument deployments to permit our sales and distribution networks to respond more rapidly to changes in surgical demand patterns and capitalize on new business opportunities; and Investing in our sales force, instrumentation and selling related activities in our spine, dental and trauma business segments. We estimate that these initiatives will add up to approximately $100 million in operating expenses in 2008, including the monitoring fees and expenses.

In addition, the Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee and the Innex Total Knee System exhibited strong growth. Growth in porous stems, including the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem, the CLS Spotorno Stem from the CLS Hip System, and the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip Stem led hip stem sales, but were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented and revision stems. Sales of bone cement improved significantly, led by PALACOS Bone Cement. In total, bone cement sales growth accounted for 1 percent of the 2007 hip sales growth over prior year. Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups, Trabecular Metal Primary Hip Prosthesis, Durom Acetabular Cups with Metasul LDH Large Diameter Heads, and Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners also had strong growth. We expect to face a near term challenge in hip sales growth with the adoption of hip 25 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT resurfacing in the U.S. market. New products are expected to contribute to sales growth in the near term but not entirely offset the lack of a hip resurfacing product within our U.S. hip portfolio. The Bigliani/Flatow Complete Shoulder Solution and the Coonrad/Morrey Total Elbow led extremities sales. Orthobiologicals and prosthetic implants, including strong growth of the Tapered Screw Vent Implant System, led dental sales. Zimmer Periarticular Locking Plates and Zimmer Plates and Screws led trauma sales. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System, the TiTLE 2 lumbar pedicle screw system, the Trinica Select Anterior Cerival Plate System and Trabecular Metal Implants led spine sales. Extremity surgical products led OSP sales.

The Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee also made a strong contribution. Growth in porous stems, including growth of the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem and Trabecular Metal Primary Hip Prosthesis led hip stem sales, but were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems. PALACOS Bone Cement, Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and Durom Acetabular Cups with Metasul LDH Large Diameter Heads also exhibited strong growth. Bone cement sales growth accounted for 2 percent of the 2007 hip sales growth over prior year. As noted above, we expect that the adoption of hip resurfacing in the U.S. market will adversely affect our hip sales growth in the near term. The Bigliani/Flatow Shoulder Solution and the Trabecular Metal Humeral Stem led extremities sales. The Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. Zimmer Periarticular Plates and Zimmer Plates and Screws led trauma sales, but were offset by declining sales of intramedullary nails and compression hip screws. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System, the Trinica Select Anterior Cervical Plate System and Spinal Trabecular Metal Implants led spine sales. Extremity surgical products led OSP sales. Europe Net Sales The following table presents Europe net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Inc Reconstructive Knees $ 408.2 $ 352.2 16 % Hips 467.8 417.8 12 Extremities 23.2 17.9 30 Dental 71.3 47.2 51 Total 970.5 835.1 16 Trauma 41.1 38.2 8 Spine 31.2 24.8 26 OSP and other 38.2 33.0 16 Total $ 1,081.0 $ 931.1 16 Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 9 percent and hip sales by 8 percent. Excluding these foreign exchange rate effects, the following product categories experienced positive sales growth in our Europe region: the NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, including the NexGen LPS Flex Knee, NexGen Trabecular Metal Tibial Components, the NexGen CR Flex Knee, and the Innex Total Knee System. Growth in porous stems, including the CLS Spotorno Stem, led hip stem sales. Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners, the Durom Hip Resurfacing System, Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and the Allofit Hip Acetabular System also contributed to hip sales. The Anatomical Shoulder System, the Anatomical Shoulder Inverse/Reverse System and the Coonrad/Morrey Total Elbow led extremities sales. The addition of a direct sales force in Italy as a result of a distributor acquisition contributed to growth in dental sales and the Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. The Cable Ready Cable Grip System, Zimmer Periarticular Plates and the NCB Plating System led trauma sales, which were offset by weaker sales of our intramedullary fixation systems. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and Trabecular Metal Implants led spine sales. Wound management products led OSP sales. 26 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Asia Pacific Net Sales The following table presents Asia Pacific net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Inc (Dec) Reconstructive Knees $ 197.2 $ 167.5 18 % Hips 201.2 191.7 5 Extremities 6.9 5.5 27 Dental 30.8 26.4 17 Total 436.1 391.1 12 Trauma 41.8 39.4 6 Spine 5.5 5.7 (4 ) OSP and Other 56.1 51.6 8 Total $ 539.5 $ 487.8 11 Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 5 percent and positively affected hip sales by 2 percent. Reported decreases in average selling prices negatively affected hip sales by 3 percent. The NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, including NexGen Trabecular Metal Tibial Components, the NexGen CR Flex Knee and the NexGen LPS Flex Knee led knee sales. Launch of the Gender Solutions Knee Femoral Implant in Australia also contributed to strong knee sales for the year. The continued conversion to porous stems, including the Fiber Metal Taper Stem from the VerSys Hip System, the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip System and the CLS Spotorno Stem led hip stem sales. Sales of Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups also exhibited growth. Extremities sales increased due to stronger sales of our shoulder and elbow products. The Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. Trauma sales were led by strong growth in Zimmer Periarticular Plates and Zimmer Plates and Screws, but were partially offset by a reported 5 percent decrease in average selling prices during 2007. A registration issue with the ST360 Spinal Fixation System in Japan resulted in a decrease in sales of this device, contributing to the negative growth in Spine sales for 2007. Powered surgical instruments led OSP sales. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 77.5 percent in 2007, compared to 77.7 percent in 2006. The following table reconciles the gross margin for 2006 to 2007: Year ended December 31, 2006 gross margin 77.7 % Foreign exchange impact, net (0.3 ) Other 0.1 Year ended December 31, 2007 gross margin 77.5 % The unfavorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses were partially offset by lower unit manufacturing costs due to productivity gains as well as favorable geographic sales mix. These gains were further offset by increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on aging product lines. Operating Expenses Research and Development, or RD, as a percentage of net sales was 5.4 percent for 2007, which is unchanged from 2006. RD increased to $209.6 million for 2007 from $188.3 million in 2006, reflecting increased spending on new product development across all of our product segments. In 2007, we continued to make investments in our research and development facilities in Warsaw, Indiana. We continued working with our third party partners on genetically engineered tissues for regenerative therapies, including soft tissue biological repair and replacement. New products, which we define as those introduced into a market in the preceding thirty six months, accounted for approximately 25 percent of net sales in 2007 compared with 24 percent in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced FDA approval of the Zimmer NexGen LPS Flex Mobile Knee. Additionally, in the second half of 2007, we launched several new products, including the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System, and the Zimmer M/L Taper Prosthesis with Kinectiv Technology. We continue to target our RD spending at the high end of what we believe to be an industry average of 4 6 percent. Selling, general and administrative, or SGA, as a percentage of net sales was 38.2 percent for 2007, compared to 38.8 percent in 2006. The improvement in SGA as a percent of net sales from the prior year is due to sales growth and well controlled spending. Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to the settlement of the federal investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Acquisition, integration and other items for 2007 were $25.2 million compared to $6.1 million in 2006. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in process research and development write offs related to acquisitions, costs related to the integration of acquired U.S. distributors, estimated settlements for certain pre acquisition product liability claims, integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2006 included $27.7 million of income related to three unrelated matters the sale of the former Centerpulse Austin land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and the favorable settlement of two pre acquisition contingent liabilities. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for 2007 decreased 3 percent to $1,127.6 million, from $1,165.2 million in 2006. The decrease is due principally to the $169.5 million settlement expense. Without the settlement expense, operating profit would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased sales and controlled operating expenses. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest increased to 31.6 percent for 2007, up from 28.6 percent in 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the effect of the $169.5 million settlement expense in 2007 for which no tax benefit has been 27 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT recognized. Without the effect of the settlement expense, the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased profitability in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings decreased 7 percent to $773.2 million for 2007, compared to $834.5 million in 2006. The decrease was due to the $169.5 million settlement expense and the higher effective tax rate that resulted from the settlement expense. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 4 percent to $3.28 and $3.26, respectively, from $3.43 and $3.40 in 2006 due to fewer outstanding shares as a result of our stock repurchase program.

In addition, strong growth in the Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee and the Innex Total Knee System was offset, in part, by declining sales of the Natural Knee II System. Growth in porous stems, including the new Trabecular Metal Primary Hip Prosthesis, Zimmer M/L Taper Stem, and the CLS Spotorno Stem from the CLS Hip System led hip sales. Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and Metasul LDH experienced strong growth offset by declining sales of Cemented Stems. Orthobiologicals and prosthetic implants, including strong growth of the Tapered Screw Vent and Internal Hex Implant Systems, led dental sales. Trabecular Metal Shoulder Stems led extremities sales. Zimmer Periarticular Plates, the Zimmer NCB Plating system, the Sirus IM Nail and I.T.S.T. Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System experienced strong growth while sales of Compression Hip Screws continued to decline. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and Spinal Trabecular Metal Implants led the growth in spine sales while sales of cages for interbody fusion declined. As a result of the termination of the OrthoPAT 7 distribution arrangement in February 2006, sales for this device fell by over $25 million, accounting for the decline in OSP product sales. 7 Trademark of Haemonetics Corporation 28 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Americas Net Sales The following table presents Americas net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Inc (Dec) Reconstructive Knees $ 940.8 $ 880.5 7 % Hips 579.4 538.1 8 Extremities 54.2 46.2 17 Dental 105.4 88.8 19 Total 1,679.8 1,553.6 8 Trauma 117.1 107.5 9 Spine 146.9 132.7 11 OSP and other 132.7 148.0 (10 ) Total $ 2,076.5 $ 1,941.8 7 The period was characterized by balanced growth in hips and knees augmented by strong growth in other product lines.

The Anatomical Shoulder System led extremities sales. Zimmer Periarticular Plates and the Zimmer NCB Plating System led trauma sales. Trabecular Metal Implants led spine sales. Strong sales of wound management products contributed to the OSP sales performance. Asia Pacific Net Sales The following table presents Asia Pacific net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Inc (Dec) Reconstructive Knees $ 167.5 $ 158.7 6 % Hips 191.7 192.2 Extremities 5.5 6.2 (13 ) Dental 26.4 19.2 37 Total 391.1 376.3 4 Trauma 39.4 39.2 1 Spine 5.7 5.3 9 OSP and other 51.6 48.7 6 Total $ 487.8 $ 469.5 4 A stronger U.S. dollar in the first half of the year resulted in a negative 3 percent effect on sales for Asia Pacific, including a 3 percent drop in knee sales and a negative 4 percent impact on hip sales. A reduction in reimbursement prices for orthopaedic implants in Japan went into effect April 1, 2006. Together with other price changes in this segment this action led to a negative 2 percent effect on sales, including negative 2 percent on knees and negative 4 percent on hips. Volume and mix growth more than offset the negative effects of price and currency in knees while netting out to result in flat sales in hips. Strong knee sales drove growth in Asia Pacific. The NexGen CR Flex Knee and the NexGen LPS Flex Knee led knee sales. The continued conversion to porous stems, including the VerSys Hip System and the CLS Spotorno Stem led hip sales. Sales of Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups also exhibited strong growth. Dental experienced double digit percentage growth compared to the prior year. The Tapered Screw Vent Implant System and the Spline Implant System led dental sales. Extremity sales were impacted by lower sales of the Bigliani/Flatow Shoulder Solution. Strong powered instrument sales contributed to the OSP sales performance. 29 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 77.7 percent in 2006, compared to 77.5 percent in 2005. The following table reconciles the gross margin for 2005 to 2006: Year ended December 31, 2005 gross margin 77.5 % Increased selling prices 0.1 Share based compensation (0.3 ) Other 0.4 Year ended December 31, 2006 gross margin 77.7 % Higher average selling prices in our largest operating segment offset by lower prices in Europe and Asia Pacific contributed to the modest improvement in gross margin. Other primary contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were the net favorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses and manufacturing productivity gains offset by underlying exposure gains and losses, increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on aging product lines and increased royalty expenses as a percentage of sales due to a higher mix of royalty bearing sales. Operating Expenses Research and Development, or RD, as a percentage of net sales was 5.4 percent for 2006, compared to 5.3 percent in 2005. RD increased to $188.3 million for 2006 from $175.5 million in 2005, reflecting increased spending on projects focused on our redefined corporate strategies. Selling, general and administrative, or SGA, as a percentage of net sales was 38.8 percent for 2006, compared to 38.3 percent in 2005. Share based compensation added $55.9 million of expense for the year ended December 31, 2006, or an additional 1.6 percentage points when compared with 2005 due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in 2006. Absent share based compensation, SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased. The decrease was primarily due to sales growth, realized expense synergies and well controlled spending. Acquisition, integration and other items for 2006 were $6.1 million compared to $56.6 million in 2005, and included $27.7 million of income related to three unrelated matters the sale of the former Centerpulse Austin land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and the favorable settlement of two pre acquisition contingent liabilities. A reduction in product liability accounted for $4.9 million of income. Expense items included a $13.4 million impairment charge for certain Centerpulse tradename and trademark intangibles based principally in our Europe operating segment, $8.8 million of integration consulting expenses, $3.3 million of employee severance and retention costs, $3.0 million of costs related to integrating our information technology systems, $2.9 million of in process research and development, $2.5 million of personnel expenses and travel for full time integration team members and $4.8 million of other expenses. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for 2006 increased 10 percent to $1,165.2 million, from $1,055.0 million in 2005. Increased sales, improved gross profit margins, realized operating expense synergies, controlled operating expenses and decreased acquisition and integration expenses offset $76.0 million of share based compensation expense to drive the increase in operating profit. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest decreased to 28.6 percent for 2006, down from 29.5 percent in 2005. The reasons for the lower effective tax rate were the implementation of several European restructuring initiatives, the successful negotiation of a lower ongoing Swiss tax rate (from approximately 24 percent to 12.5 percent) and the continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico. Net earnings increased 14 percent to $834.5 million for 2006, compared to $732.5 million in 2005. The increase was due to higher operating profit, lower acquisition, integration and other expenses, decreased interest expense due to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower effective tax rate, offset by $54.5 million of share based compensation expense, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 16 percent to $3.43 and $3.40, respectively, from $2.96 and $2.93 in 2005. OPERATING PROFIT BY SEGMENT Management evaluates operating segment performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses, share based compensation expense, settlement expense, acquisition, integration and other expenses, inventory step up, in process research and development write offs and intangible asset amortization expense. Global operations include research, development engineering, medical education, brand management, corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and U.S. and Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and logistics. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from segment operating profit. For more information regarding our segments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The following table sets forth the operating profit as a percentage of sales by segment for 2007, 2006 and 2005: Percent of net sales Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Americas 52.0 % 52.7 % 52.6 % Europe 40.0 41.4 36.3 Asia Pacific 48.2 47.5 45.2 Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased due to increased spending for advertising as well as increased sales force related expenses due to the 30 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT expansion of our U.S. distributor network. These increases were partially offset by improved gross margins. Europe operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily as a result of decreased gross margins from the impact of losses from foreign currency hedges. The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by controlled spending. Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to improved gross margins. Gross margins increased throughout many Asia Pacific markets, including Japan, despite decreases in average selling prices in Japan as a result of reductions in government controlled reimbursement prices. The improvement in gross margins in Asia Pacific is due to favorable product sales mix and lower unit manufacturing costs. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased due to the effective control of operating expenses, including realized expense synergies and controlled selling, general and administrative spending. European operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved due to improved gross margin and the realization of expense synergies related to the elimination of redundant functions and controlled selling, general and administrative spending. Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to product category mix, and controlled selling, general and administrative spending. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,084.4 million in 2007 compared to $1,040.7 million in 2006. The principal source of cash was net earnings of $773.2 million. In 2007, cash provided from net earnings was reduced by $169.5 million as a result of the settlement with the Department of Justice. Non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another $364.5 million of operating cash. All other items of operating cash flows accounted for a use of $53.3 million of cash pertaining principally to investments in working capital in support of sales growth. Also included in operating cash flows for 2007 is approximately $23 million related to accrued but unpaid amounts under various contractual arrangements with healthcare professionals or institutions. Operating cash flows were increased and cash flows used in financing activities were decreased by $13.6 million when compared with amounts furnished in the current report filed on Form 8 K dated January 29, 2008. We continue to focus on working capital management. At December 31, 2007, we had 52 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable, a decrease of 3 days when compared to December 31, 2006. The improvement was achieved through improvement in all reporting segments. At December 31, 2007, we had 258 days of inventory on hand, favorable to December 31, 2006 by 19 days. This decrease reflects higher cost of goods sold and strong underlying demand in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our inventory levels have improved from a third quarter high of 330 days as a result of seasonal demand patterns. Cash flows used in investing activities were $491.5 million in 2007, compared to $287.0 million in 2006. The most significant contributor to the increase in cash flows used in investing activities were the payments related to the acquisitions of Endius and ORTHOsoft as well as additions to our global distributor network. Cash payments related to acquisitions for 2007 was $160.3 million compared to $34.9 million in 2006. Additions to instruments during 2007 were $138.5 million compared to $126.2 million in 2006. Additions to instruments increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to an increase in instrument deployments related to new product launches. In 2008, we expect to spend approximately $155 $170 million on instruments to support new products, sales growth and MIS Procedures. Additions to other property, plant and equipment during 2007 were $192.7 million compared to $142.1 million in 2006. Increases were related to facility expansions in Warsaw, Indiana; Ponce, Puerto Rico; and Winterthur, Switzerland; and investment in new information technology systems. These facility expansions improved working conditions and capabilities for our research and development organization, responded to increased demand and the transfer of production to our other manufacturing sites. During 2008, we expect to purchase approximately $315 $330 million in other property, plant and equipment, under our planned infrastructure improvements and international manufacturing expansion. Cash flows used in financing activities were $399.5 million for 2007, compared to $730.7 million in 2006. We repurchased $576.3 million of our common stock in 2007 as compared with $798.8 million in 2006 under our stock repurchase programs. We utilized cash generated from operating activities and $149.8 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans to fund the repurchases. We may use excess cash to fund future purchases, if any, under our stock repurchase programs. We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing November 30, 2012 (the Senior Credit Facility). We had $104.3 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2007, and an availability of $1,245.7 million. The $104.3 million is for use in Japan and carries a low interest rate. The Senior Credit Facility contains provisions by which we can increase the line to $1,750 million and request that the maturity date be extended for two additional one year periods. We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a LIBOR based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit Facility contains 31 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2007. Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a facility and a utilization fee. The Senior Credit Facility is rated A by Standard Poors Ratings Services and is not rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $70.4 million. Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, are sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions): 2009 2011 2013 and and and Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2010 2012 Thereafter Long term debt $ 104.3 $ $ $ 104.3 $ Operating leases 134.3 35.4 50.0 28.6 20.3 Purchase Obligations 24.6 23.2 1.4 Long term income taxes payable 137.0 57.7 53.9 25.4 Other long term liabilities 191.4 47.3 17.1 127.0 Total contractual obligations $ 591.6 $ 58.6 $ 156.4 $ 203.9 $ 172.7 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below. Excess Inventory and Instruments We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis. Income Taxes We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. We operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense, liabilities and reserves. We believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit. Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. The amounts established equate to less than 5 percent of total liabilities and represent managements best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets. Share based Payment We account for share based payment expense in accordance with the fair value 32 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), share based payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options. The expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this report under Item 8. 33 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities, and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. These forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won or purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2008 through May 2010. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were $1,244.6 million and $1,169.3 million, respectively. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $138.4 million and $205.0 million, respectively. The weighted average contract rates outstanding are Euro:USD 1.34, USD:Swiss Franc 1.19, USD:Japanese Yen 109, British Pound:USD 1.92, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.09, Australian Dollar:USD 0.78 and USD:Korean Won 929. We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007, indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2010, depending on the direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of $78.4 million, $13.1 million, $20.4 million, $14.6 million, $5.3 million, $6.5 million and $2.0 million for the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won contracts, respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $1,869.1 million at December 31, 2007, primarily in Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately $1,178 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2007 relates to goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. As a result, foreign currency translation gains/losses recognized in earnings under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation are generally offset with gain/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT INTEREST RATE RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities. Presently, we invest our cash and equivalents primarily in U.S. government treasury funds and bank deposits. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities. We are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and our uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of our debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates. We currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure, but may do so in the future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2007, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on interest expense. Further, this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments, and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments. We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. However, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk. 35 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, the companys internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 36 ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2007 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT
