ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical products (sometimes referred to in this report as OSP). We also provide other healthcare related services. Orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients who have lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the bodys natural healing process. OSP include supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post operation rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries. We manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2007 and 2006 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. Beginning in 2008, our Hips product category sales no longer include bone cement and accessory sales, which have been reclassified to our OSP and Other product category. Amounts in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 related to sales of bone cement and accessory products have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. We believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008. Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 3 percentage points of 2008 sales growth, which is 6 percentage points below the rate of growth from 2007 compared to 2006. We estimate that the orthopaedic procedure volume market growth rate on a global basis will be in the mid single digits in the coming years driven by an aging global population, obesity and more active lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the continued shift in demand to premium products, such as Longevity, Durasul and Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes, Trabecular Metal Technology products, high flex knees, knee revision products and porous hip stems, continue to positively affect sales growth. Our 2008 increase of 3 percentage points decreased from 2007 and was lower than market growth due to the factors discussed below. Pricing Trends Selling prices were flat during 2008, which is similar to 2007 when compared to 2006. Asia Pacific selling prices decreased 3 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to a 1 percent decrease in 2007 when compared to 2006. Japan and Australia reported 4 percent and 3 percent decreases, respectively, in average selling prices as a result of scheduled reductions in reimbursement prices. Japan and Australia combined represent approximately 10 percent of our sales. Selling prices in the Americas were flat during 2008, compared to a 1 percent increase in 2007. In Europe, selling prices for 2008 were flat, compared to a 1 percent decrease in 2007. With the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and pressure from group purchasing organizations, we expect global selling prices to remain flat in 2009. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates For 2008, foreign currency exchange rates had a positive 3 percent effect on global sales growth. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end rates, we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in 2009 of approximately 4 percent on sales. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities, and, under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, through the use of forward contracts and options solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal. Abbott Spine Acquisition In October 2008, we acquired Abbott Spine, previously a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for approximately $360 million. The purchase price was funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities. This investment adds a number of innovative products and helps build toward critical mass in the Spine product category. The acquisition also enhances our research and development capabilities in the Spine product category and strengthens our sales coverage. We recorded $48.7 million of acquisition and integration costs in 2008 as a result of this transaction, including $38.5 million of in process research and development expense. For more information regarding the acquisition of Abbott Spine, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. 22 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Compliance Related Matters In September 2007, we and other major U.S. orthopaedic manufacturers reached a settlement with the U.S. government to resolve claims related to an investigation into financial relationships between the industry and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. We paid the government $169.5 million and entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) under which we will remain subject to oversight by a federally appointed monitor through March 27, 2009. We also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has a term of 5 years. For more information regarding the settlement, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. We did not record any tax benefit related to the $169.5 million payment in 2007. During 2008, we reached an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service confirming the deductibility of a portion of the payment and recorded a current tax benefit of $31.7 million, resulting in a decrease to the current period effective tax rate. For more information regarding the tax treatment of the settlement expense, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. We have developed and substantially implemented enhanced global compliance initiatives which address areas such as product development, marketing, surgeon training and educational and charitable funding. The principles of this program meet or exceed the requirements of the DPA and CIA, as those principles are being applied in most respects to all product segments and reach all worldwide operations. Costs related to the DPA, CIA and the enhanced compliance initiatives in 2008 were approximately $60 million, including the fees incurred for the federally appointed monitor. Durom Acetabular Component In July 2008, we temporarily suspended marketing and distribution of the Durom Acetabular Component (Durom Cup) in the U.S. to permit us to update product labeling to provide more detailed surgical technique instructions and implement an enhanced surgical training program in the U.S. We resumed marketing and distribution of the Durom Cup in the U.S. in August 2008. During 2008, we received claims from a number of Durom Cup patients seeking reimbursement for costs and payments for alleged pain and suffering and we expect to receive additional similar claims. We recorded a provision for certain claims of $69.0 million in 2008, which represents managements estimate of liability to patients undergoing revision surgeries related to the Durom Cup. The estimate is limited to revisions associated with surgeries occurring before July 2008 and within two years of the original surgery date. Any claims received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard product liability accruals. We believe we lost hip product sales during 2008, in large part as a consequence of the events involving the Durom Cup. In addition, we expect that our entry into the U.S. hip resurfacing market has been hindered or delayed as the Durom Cup had previously been integral to our plans for entry into that market. Orthopaedic Surgical Products (OSP) Actions In the first half of 2008, we initiated voluntary product recalls of certain OSP patient care products manufactured at our Dover, Ohio facility that we determined did not meet internal quality standards and we temporarily suspended production and sales of certain OSP products manufactured at the Dover facility. We estimate that these actions adversely impacted 2008 OSP revenues by approximately $70 million and 2008 diluted earnings per share by $0.18 including related inventory charges, idle plant costs and other non recurring charges. We expect to have a significant portion of these products back in production in the first quarter of 2009, with most other products coming back into production in the second quarter of 2009. Impact of Disruptive Events on Market Share As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, including our temporary suspension of U.S. marketing and distribution of the Durom Cup, our voluntary recall and suspension of production of certain OSP patient care products, and the implementation of our enhanced global compliance initiatives, we have suffered customer losses during 2008. We estimate that these customer losses reduced our knee and hip market share by 1.5 to 2.0 percent as measured from fourth quarter results. We expect our sales growth to be at a rate slower than the market in the near term due to these disruptive factors. 2009 Outlook We expect conditions in the broader economy will result in a temporary slowdown in elective hospital procedures. Although many of our products are used in elective procedures, we believe our core knee and hip franchises remain more insulated than most from swings in the broader economy because the need for these procedures does not diminish, even if the timing is affected. We expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 affecting our knee and hip market share as a result of the ongoing effects of the disruptive factors discussed above. Our assumption is that share loss should stabilize by year end 2009, as we anniversary out of the majority of the 2008 customer and product related losses, and as we launch new products in sufficient quantities to recover some of the product related losses. Among our other product categories, we expect extremities and trauma sales growth to be in line with market growth rates. We expect dental revenues to reflect the weak economic environment and to underperform relative to market growth rates given company specific operational challenges. Finally, we expect spine revenues to increase as a result of the Abbott Spine acquisition and reflect sales dis synergies associated with the ongoing integration of the two businesses. 23 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT In 2009, our operating expenses will be impacted by a number of factors, which in the aggregate are expected to result in a modest net decrease in total expense compared to 2008. We expect to realize significant savings from third party fees related to compliance with the DPA and the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives, Durom related certain claims and acquisition, integration and other expenses. For 2009, however, we intend to partially offset those savings with increased spending in areas that suffered disruption in 2008, including product development and medical education. We also continue to step up our level of spending on quality systems to achieve our continuous improvement objectives in the areas of design and process control as well as ongoing product surveillance. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Sales by Operating Segment The following table presents net sales by operating segment and the components of the percentage changes (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Volume/ Foreign 2008 2007 % Inc Mix Price Exchange Americas $ 2,353.9 $ 2,277.0 3 % 3 % % % Europe 1,179.1 1,081.0 9 4 5 Asia Pacific 588.1 539.5 9 5 (3 ) 7 Total $ 4,121.1 $ 3,897.5 6 3 3 Foreign Exchange as used in the tables in this report represents the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on sales growth.

In addition, the Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee and the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System exhibited strong growth. The continued conversion to porous stems, including the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem, the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology, the CLS Spotorno Stem from the CLS Hip System, and the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip Stem, led hip stem sales, but was partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems. Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners also had strong growth. The temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Durom Cup in the U.S. negatively impacted hip sales growth. Additionally, with the lack of a hip resurfacing product within our U.S. hip portfolio, we expect to face a continuing challenge in hip sales growth with the adoption of hip resurfacing in the U.S. market. As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, we suffered customer losses during 2008. We estimate that these customer losses reduced our knee and hip market share by 1.5 to 2.0 percent as measured from fourth quarter results. We expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors. The Bigliani/Flatow Complete Shoulder Solution and the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System led extremities sales. Orthobiologicals and prosthetic implants, including strong growth of the Tapered Screw Vent Implant System, led dental sales. Zimmer Periarticular Locking Plates and the I.T.S.T. Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System led trauma sales. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization 24 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT System and the Trinica Select Anterior Cervical Plate System led spine sales, which also reflect an increase as a result of the Abbott Spine acquisition. OSP sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products, but these negative factors were partially offset by strong growth in PALACOS Bone Cement.

The Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System also made a strong contribution. Growth in porous stems, including growth of the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem and the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology, led hip stem sales, but was partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems. Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners also made a strong contribution. As noted above, the temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Durom Cup in the U.S. will continue to negatively impact hip sales and we also expect that the adoption of hip resurfacing in the U.S. market will continue to adversely affect our hip sales growth. As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, we suffered customer losses during 2008. These customer losses negatively impacted sales growth, primarily in the knee and hip product segments. We expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors. The Bigliani/Flatow Shoulder Solution and the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System led extremities sales. Negative sales growth for our dental business reflects disruptions caused by the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives and overall weakness in the U.S. economy. Zimmer Periarticular Plates and the I.T.S.T. Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System led trauma sales. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and the Trinica Select Anterior Cervical Plate System led spine sales, which also reflect an increase as a result of the Abbott Spine acquisition. OSP sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products, but these negative factors were partially offset by strong growth in PALACOS Bone Cement. Europe Net Sales The following table presents Europe net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Inc (Dec) Reconstructive Knees $ 452.6 $ 407.8 11 % Hips 493.9 459.9 7 Extremities 25.8 23.2 11 Dental 82.2 71.3 15 Total 1,054.5 962.2 10 Trauma 47.4 41.1 16 Spine 40.1 31.2 29 OSP and other 37.1 46.5 (20 ) Total $ 1,179.1 $ 1,081.0 9 Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected both knee and hip sales by 5 percent. The NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, including the NexGen LPS Flex Knee, the NexGen LCCK Revision Knee and the NexGen CR Flex Knee, led knee sales in our Europe region. Growth in porous stems, including the CLS Spotorno Stem, led hip stem sales. Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners, Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and the Allofit Hip Acetabular System also contributed to hip sales. As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, we suffered customer losses during 2008. These customer losses negatively impacted sales growth, primarily in the knee and hip product segments. We expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors. The Anatomical Shoulder System and the Coonrad/Morrey Total Elbow led extremities sales. The Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. The Cable Ready Cable Grip System and the NCB Plating System led 25 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT trauma sales, which were offset by weaker sales of our intramedullary fixation systems. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and the Optimatm5 ZS Spinal Fixation System led spine sales. OSP sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products. Asia Pacific Net Sales The following table presents Asia Pacific net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Inc (Dec) Reconstructive Knees $ 220.6 $ 197.0 12 % Hips 209.5 193.2 8 Extremities 7.1 6.9 3 Dental 30.4 30.8 (1 ) Total 467.6 427.9 9 Trauma 48.2 41.8 15 Spine 9.2 5.5 65 OSP and other 63.1 64.3 (2 ) Total $ 588.1 $ 539.5 9 Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 6 percent and hip sales by 8 percent. Reported decreases in average selling prices negatively affected both knee and hip sales by 4 percent. The NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, the NexGen CR Flex Knee and the NexGen LPS Flex Knee led knee sales. The Gender Solutions Knee Femoral Implant also made strong contributions to knee sales for the period. The continued conversion to porous stems, including the Fiber Metal Taper Stem from the VerSys Hip System, the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip System and the CLS Spotorno Stem, led hip stem sales. Sales of Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners, the Trilogy Acetabular System and Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups also increased. As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, we suffered customer losses during 2008. These customer losses negatively impacted sales growth, primarily in the knee and hip product segments. We expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors. The Bigliani/Flatow Shoulder Solution and the Coonrad/Morrey Total Elbow led extremities sales. The Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. Trauma sales were led by the I.T.S.T. Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System led spine sales. OSP sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 75.8 percent in 2008, compared to 77.5 percent in 2007. The following table reconciles the gross margin for 2007 to 2008: Year ended December 31, 2007 gross margin 77.5 % Foreign exchange impact, net (0.8 ) Excess and obsolete inventory (0.6 ) Inventory step up (0.2 ) Other (0.1 ) Year ended December 31, 2008 gross margin 75.8 % Gross margin decreased in 2008 primarily due to the unfavorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses as well as an increase in excess inventory and obsolescence charges due to write offs related to the OSP patient care product recalls and increased inventory levels as a result of lower than forecasted sales. Inventory step up related to the completion of the Abbott Spine acquisition during 2008 also had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. Operating Expenses Research and Development, or RD, as a percentage of net sales was 4.7 percent for 2008, compared to 5.4 percent in 2007. RD decreased to $194.0 million for 2008 from $209.6 million in 2007, reflecting decreased spending on certain development, clinical and external research activities due to delays connected with our operational compliance with the DPA and CIA and implementation of our enhanced compliance and ethics initiatives. We do not expect delays with our development programs in 2009 and therefore our RD expense as a percentage of revenue is expected to return to historical levels of 5 to 6 percent. Selling, general and administrative, or SGA, as a percentage of net sales was 41.3 percent for 2008, compared to 38.2 percent in 2007. SGA expense increased to $1,702.3 million for 2008, from $1,489.7 million in 2007. Increased SGA costs include monitor fees as well as consulting and legal fees associated with the global implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives. Expenses related to other operating initiatives also caused an increase in SGA as a percentage of net sales. Such operating initiatives include the planned implementation of a global IT system and improving quality systems at our Dover facility. Additionally, selling costs increased as a result of the ORTHOsoft acquisition, an increase in the headcount of our sales force in certain locations, increased commission incentives to sell certain key products and a change in the mix of commissions earned as a result of lower OSP sales. Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to the settlement of the federal investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. 5 Trademark of U i Corporation 26 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Certain claims expense of $69.0 million is a provision for estimated claims from Durom Cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified periods. Acquisition, integration and other expenses increased to $68.5 million for 2008, compared to $25.2 million in 2007. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2008 include $38.5 million for in process research and development related to the Abbott Spine acquisition, costs related to the integration of Abbott Spine, facility consolidation costs, legal fees, and retention and termination payments, partially offset by favorable adjustments to certain liabilities of acquired companies. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in process research and development write offs related to acquisitions, costs related to the integration of acquired U.S. distributors, estimated settlements for certain pre acquisition product liability claims, integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for 2008 decreased 3 percent to $1,090.0 million, from $1,127.6 million in 2007. Operating profit for 2007 includes the effect of the non recurring settlement expense of $169.5 million. Excluding the impact of the settlement expense in 2007, operating profit for 2008 would still have been unfavorable compared to 2007 as a result of lower gross margins, significant but temporary increases in SGA costs attributable to the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives and certain claims expense of $69.0 million. Interest and other income for 2008 increased to $31.8 million, from $4.0 million in 2007. Interest and other income for 2008 includes a realized gain of $38.8 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities, partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of an increase in outstanding long term debt. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest decreased to 24.3 percent for 2008, down from 31.6 percent in 2007. The effective tax rate for the 2007 period reflects the effect of the $169.5 million settlement expense, for which no tax benefit had previously been recognized. During 2008, we recorded a current tax benefit of $31.7 million related to the settlement expense, resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent to the current period effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2008 was further reduced as a result of increased profits in lower tax jurisdictions. These decreases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by Abbott Spine acquisition related in process research and development charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded. Net earnings increased 10 percent to $848.6 million for 2008, compared to $773.2 million in 2007, as the decrease in operating profit was more than offset by favorable items in interest and other income and a lower effective tax rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14 percent to $3.73 and $3.72, respectively, from $3.28 and $3.26 in 2007. The higher growth rate in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2008 and 2007 share repurchases.

PALACOS Bone Cement led OSP sales. 28 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Europe Net Sales The following table presents Europe net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Inc Reconstructive Knees $ 407.8 $ 352.2 16 % Hips 459.9 408.3 13 Extremities 23.2 17.9 30 Dental 71.3 47.2 51 Total 962.2 825.6 17 Trauma 41.1 38.2 8 Spine 31.2 24.8 26 OSP and other 46.5 42.5 9 Total $ 1,081.0 $ 931.1 16 Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 9 percent and hip sales by 8 percent. Excluding these foreign exchange rate effects, the following product categories experienced positive sales growth in our Europe region: the NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, including the NexGen LPS Flex Knee, NexGen Trabecular Metal Tibial Components, the NexGen CR Flex Knee, and the Innex Total Knee System. Growth in porous stems, including the CLS Spotorno Stem, led hip stem sales. Longevity and Durasul Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners, the Durom Hip Resurfacing System, Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and the Allofit Hip Acetabular System also contributed to hip sales. The Anatomical Shoulder System, the Anatomical Shoulder Inverse/Reverse System and the Coonrad/Morrey Total Elbow led extremities sales. The addition of a direct sales force in Italy as a result of a distributor acquisition contributed to growth in dental sales and the Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. The Cable Ready Cable Grip System, Zimmer Periarticular Plates and the NCB Plating System led trauma sales, which were offset by weaker sales of our intramedullary fixation systems. The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and Trabecular Metal Implants led spine sales. Wound management products led OSP sales. Asia Pacific Net Sales The following table presents Asia Pacific net sales (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Inc (Dec) Reconstructive Knees $ 197.0 $ 167.5 18 % Hips 193.2 184.8 5 Extremities 6.9 5.5 27 Dental 30.8 26.4 17 Total 427.9 384.2 11 Trauma 41.8 39.4 6 Spine 5.5 5.7 (4 ) OSP and other 64.3 58.5 10 Total $ 539.5 $ 487.8 11 Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 5 percent and positively affected hip sales by 2 percent. Reported decreases in average selling prices negatively affected hip sales by 3 percent. The NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, including NexGen Trabecular Metal Tibial Components, the NexGen CR Flex Knee and the NexGen LPS Flex Knee led knee sales. Launch of the Gender Solutions Knee Femoral Implant in Australia also contributed to strong knee sales for the year. The continued conversion to porous stems, including the Fiber Metal Taper Stem from the VerSys Hip System, the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip System and the CLS Spotorno Stem led hip stem sales. Sales of Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups also exhibited growth. Extremities sales increased due to stronger sales of our shoulder and elbow products. The Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. Trauma sales were led by strong growth in Zimmer Periarticular Plates and Zimmer Plates and Screws, but were partially offset by a reported 5 percent decrease in average selling prices during 2007. A registration issue with the ST360 Spinal Fixation System in Japan resulted in a decrease in sales of this device, contributing to the negative growth in Spine sales for 2007. Powered surgical instruments and Bone Cement and accessories led OSP sales. Gross Profit Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 77.5 percent in 2007, compared to 77.7 percent in 2006. The following table reconciles the gross margin for 2006 to 2007: Year ended December 31, 2006 gross margin 77.7 % Foreign exchange impact, net (0.3 ) Other 0.1 Year ended December 31, 2007 gross margin 77.5 % The unfavorable effect of year over year changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses were partially offset by lower unit manufacturing costs due to productivity gains as well as favorable geographic sales mix. These gains were further offset by increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on aging product lines. Operating Expenses RD as a percentage of net sales was 5.4 percent for 2007, which is unchanged from 2006. RD increased to $209.6 million for 2007 from $188.3 million in 2006, reflecting increased spending on new product development across all of our product segments. In 2007, we continued to make investments in our research and development facilities in Warsaw, Indiana. We continued working with our third party partners on genetically engineered tissues for regenerative therapies, including soft tissue biological repair and replacement. SGA, as a percentage of net sales was 38.2 percent for 2007, compared to 38.8 percent in 2006. The improvement in SGA as a percent of net sales from the prior year is due to sales growth and well controlled spending. 29 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to the settlement of the federal investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Acquisition, integration and other items for 2007 were $25.2 million compared to $6.1 million in 2006. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in process research and development write offs related to acquisitions, costs related to the integration of acquired U.S. distributors, estimated settlements for certain pre acquisition product liability claims, integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2006 included $27.7 million of income related to three unrelated matters the sale of the former Centerpulse Austin land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and the favorable settlement of two pre acquisition contingent liabilities. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for 2007 decreased 3 percent to $1,127.6 million, from $1,165.2 million in 2006. The decrease is due principally to the $169.5 million settlement expense. Without the settlement expense, operating profit would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased sales and controlled operating expenses. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and minority interest increased to 31.6 percent for 2007, up from 28.6 percent in 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the effect of the $169.5 million settlement expense in 2007 for which no tax benefit was recognized. Without the effect of the settlement expense, the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased profitability in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings decreased 7 percent to $773.2 million for 2007, compared to $834.5 million in 2006. The decrease was due to the $169.5 million settlement expense and the higher effective tax rate that resulted from the settlement expense. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 4 percent to $3.28 and $3.26, respectively, from $3.43 and $3.40 in 2006 due to fewer outstanding shares as a result of our stock repurchase program. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,038.1 million in 2008 compared to $1,084.4 million in 2007. The principal source of cash was net earnings of $848.6 million. Non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another $353.7 million of operating cash. Income tax related balances decreased by $77.3 million in 2008, primarily reflecting the impact of accelerated tax payments resulting from changes in Federal and State tax rules. All other items of operating cash flows accounted for a use of $86.9 million of cash pertaining to pension funding and to investments in working capital in support of sales services. Operating cash flows continued to be positively affected by delayed payments related to various contractual arrangements with healthcare professionals or institutions. For 2008, we estimate this delay had a positive effect on operating cash flows of approximately $26 million. At December 31, 2008, we had 59 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable, an increase of 7 days when compared to December 31, 2007, reflecting a change in geographic mix of outstanding accounts receivable balances and a general weakening in the broader economy. At December 31, 2008, we had 344 days of inventory on hand, above December 31, 2007 by 86 days, reflecting a planned increase in field based inventory deployments in the U.S., a build out of our inventory pipeline for certain new products we are preparing to launch in 2009, lower than expected sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the year over year change in foreign currency hedge gains/losses impacting cost of goods sold. Cash flows used in investing activities were $924.2 million in 2008, compared to $491.5 million in 2007. The most significant contributors to the increase in cash flows used in investing activities were the acquisition of Abbott Spine and the acquisition of intellectual property rights. Cash payments related to the acquisition of Abbott Spine were $363.0 million compared to total acquisition related payments of $160.3 million in 2007, which related primarily to the acquisitions of Endius and ORTHOsoft. Acquired intellectual property rights of $109.4 million relate to lump sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of an existing contractual arrangement. These lump sum payments were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the current net present value of the contractual arrangement. In 2009, we anticipate making additional lump sum payments to acquire intellectual property rights. Additions to instruments during 2008 were $237.9 million compared to $138.5 million in 2007. Additions to instruments increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in instrument deployments to permit our sales and distribution networks to respond more rapidly to changes in surgical demand patterns and capitalize on new business opportunities. In 2009, we expect to spend approximately $160 $170 million on instruments to support new products and sales. Additions to other property, plant and equipment during 2008 were $250.0 million compared to $192.7 million in 2007. This increase reflects spending on planned infrastructure improvements such as opening a new manufacturing facility in Ireland, improving our quality system infrastructure and investing in a central distribution center for our Europe segment. During 2009, we expect to purchase approximately $230 $240 million in other property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cash necessary to complete capital expansions initiated in 2008 as well as new product related investments and normal replacement of older machinery and equipment. Also included in investing activities for 2008 is $54.9 million in proceeds from the sale of certain equity securities. Cash flows used in financing activities were $343.5 million for 2008, compared to $399.5 million in 2007. We repurchased $737.0 million of our common stock in 2008 as compared with $576.3 million in 2007 under our stock 30 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT repurchase programs. We utilized cash generated from operating activities, $57.0 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and borrowings under credit facilities to fund the repurchases. During 2008, we borrowed $330.0 million from our existing credit facilities to fund stock repurchases and partially fund the acquisition of Abbott Spine. We may use excess cash or further borrow from our credit facilities to repurchase additional common stock under the $1.25 billion program which expires December 31, 2009. We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing November 30, 2012 (the Senior Credit Facility). We had $460.1 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2008, and an availability of $889.9 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains provisions by which we can increase the line to $1,750 million and request that the maturity date be extended for two additional one year periods. We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes and bear interest at a LIBOR based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008. Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a facility and a utilization fee. The Senior Credit Facility is rated A by Standard Poors Ratings Services and is not rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. Notwithstanding recent interruptions in global credit markets, as of the date of this report, we believe our access to our Senior Credit Facility has not been impaired. In October 2008, we funded a portion of the acquisition of Abbott Spine with approximately $110 million of new borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. Each of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility funded its portion of the new borrowings in accordance with its commitment percentage. We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $71.4 million. Management believes that cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, are sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions): 2010 2012 2014 and and and Contractual Obligations Total 2009 2011 2013 Thereafter Long term debt $ 460.1 $ $ $ 460.1 $ Operating leases 149.3 38.2 51.0 30.2 29.9 Purchase obligations 56.8 47.7 7.6 1.5 Long term income taxes payable 116.9 69.6 24.9 22.4 Other long term liabilities 237.0 30.7 15.1 191.2 Total contractual obligations $ 1,020.1 $ 85.9 $ 158.9 $ 531.8 $ 243.5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below. Excess Inventory and Instruments We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis. Income Taxes We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. We operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions. We are subject to regulatory 31 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense, liabilities and reserves. We believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit. Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. During 2008, in addition to our general product liability estimates, we recorded a provision for certain claims of $69.0 million representing managements estimate of liability to Durom Cup patients undergoing revisions associated with surgeries occurring before July 2008 and within two years of the original surgery date. These parameters are consistent with our data which indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical technique are most likely to occur within that time period. Any claims received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard product liability accruals. The amounts established for our general product liability estimates, excluding certain claims for the Durom Cup, equate to less than 5 percent of total liabilities and represent managements best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets. Share based Payment We account for share based payment expense in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), share based payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options. The expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this report under Item 8. 32 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities, and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. These forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won or purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2009 through June 2011. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $1,343.0 million and $1,244.6 million, respectively. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $207.5 million and $138.4 million, respectively. The weighted average contract rates outstanding are Euro:USD 1.41, USD:Swiss Franc 1.10, USD:Japanese Yen 101, British Pound:USD 1.86, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.09, Australian Dollar:USD 0.82 and USD:Korean Won 1,000. We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008 indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2011, depending on the direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of $72.3 million, $21.1 million, $32.4 million, $10.4 million, $7.1 million, $7.2 million and $1.9 million for the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won contracts, respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $2,003 million at December 31, 2008, primarily in Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately $1,234 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2008 relates to goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. As a result, foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 33 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT INTEREST RATE RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities. Presently, we invest our cash and equivalents primarily in U.S. government treasury funds and bank deposits. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities. We are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and our uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of our debt outstanding bears interest at short term rates. We currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure, but we may do so in the future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2008, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on interest expense. Further, this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments, and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and investments. We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. However, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk. 34 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, the companys internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 35 ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2008 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT
