ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. OVERVIEW We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive implants, dental implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical products (sometimes referred to in this report as OSP). We also provide other healthcare related services. We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries. We manage operations through three reportable geographic segments the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2008 and 2007 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation. Beginning in 2009, we no longer include our Dental product category sales within our Reconstructive products category. Amounts in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 related to sales of Dental products have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation. We believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009. Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 2 percentage points of 2009 sales growth, which is 1 percentage point below the rate of growth from 2008 compared to 2007. We believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume temporarily decelerated from mid single digit growth rates to low single digit growth rates on a global basis due to the weakened global economy. We believe long term market growth rates will be driven by an aging global population, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the ongoing shift in demand to premium products, such as Longevity and Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes, Trabecular Metal Technology products, hip stems with Kinectiv Technology, high flex knees, knee revision products, porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices continues to positively affect sales growth. Our 2 percentage points of sales growth in 2009 from volume and changes in mix decreased from 2008 and was lower than market growth due to the impact of the disruptive events discussed below. Pricing Trends Global selling prices decreased 1 percent during 2009 compared to flat pricing in 2008. Selling prices in the Americas decreased 1 percent during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to flat pricing in the same 2008 period. Europe selling prices were flat for the year ended December 31, 2009, which is similar to the 2008 period. Asia Pacific selling prices decreased 1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a 3 percent decrease in the same 2008 period, as we anniversaried out of scheduled reductions in reimbursement prices in Japan. With the effect of governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and continuing pressure from local hospitals and health systems, we expect selling prices to decrease approximately 1 to 2 percent on a global basis for 2010. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates For 2009, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 2 percent decline in sales. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with 2009 year end rates, we estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2010 of approximately 1 percent on sales. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities, and, under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, through the use of forward contracts and options solely for managing foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal. Disruptive Events We suffered customer losses as a result of disruptive factors experienced during 2008, including the implementation of our enhanced global compliance initiatives, our temporary suspension of U.S. marketing and distribution of the Durom Cup and our voluntary recall and suspension of production of certain OSP patient care products. We estimate that these customer losses reduced our global knee market share by approximately 1.5 percent and hip market share by approximately 2 percent on a cumulative basis through the end of 2008. These share losses affected sales growth in 2009, especially in the first six to nine months of the year, but stabilized as we concluded the year. Global Economic Conditions We believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have resulted in a slowdown in elective hospital procedures. We saw evidence of recovery in 2009, although the large developed countries in Europe appear to be lagging the U.S. and Japan. Although many of our products are used in elective procedures, we believe our core knee and hip franchises remain more insulated than many medical product categories from swings in the broader economy because the need for these procedures does not diminish, even if the 22 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT timing is affected. In particular, our dental revenues have experienced pressure due to the weak economic environment as many of those procedures are not reimbursed by third party payors. 2010 Outlook In the second half of 2009, we saw encouraging signs that orthopaedic procedure volumes in certain markets were recovering. Our market assumptions are that in 2010 knee and hip procedures will grow in mid single digits within the Americas and Asia Pacific markets, and remain flat to slightly positive in the large developed markets in Europe. Given the expected pacing of our new product launches, such as the Zimmer MMC Cup, Continuum Acetabular System and Zimmer Patient Specific Instruments, we anticipate our sales growth in 2010 to be greater in the second half of the year. We expect to continue making investments in RD in the range of 5 to 6 percent of sales. Assuming currency rates remain at year end 2009 levels, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 75 percent of sales in 2010. This takes into account the higher cost inventory we carry into 2010 as well as projected foreign currency hedge losses partially offset by lower anticipated excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2010. We expect the gross margin ratio to be slightly lower in the first half of 2010 as compared to the second half of the year. SGA as a percent of sales is expected to decrease for the full year as we restore leverage from revenue growth offset, in part, by sales and marketing investments in support of new product launches. We have completed the infrastructure investment projects in Eschbach, Germany, our automated, centralized distribution facility for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and in Shannon, Ireland, our new implant manufacturing facility. Both facilities are now operational and should provide economic benefits for the full year 2010. We expect interest expense will be unfavorable year over year due to the $1 billion senior notes offering we completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. The impact of this expense on our diluted earnings per share should be more than offset by the additional shares we repurchased with a portion of the proceeds from the notes offering. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net Sales by Reportable Segment The following table presents net sales by reportable segment and the components of the percentage changes (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Volume/ Foreign 2009 2008 % Inc/(Dec) Mix Price Exchange Americas $ 2,372.4 $ 2,353.9 1 % 2 % (1 )% % Europe 1,119.2 1,179.1 (5 ) 1 (6 ) Asia Pacific 603.8 588.1 3 1 (1 ) 3 Total $ 4,095.4 $ 4,121.1 (1 ) 2 (1 ) (2 ) Foreign Exchange as used in the tables in this report represents the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales growth.

In addition, the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System made a strong contribution. In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected knee sales by 6 percent. Hips The continued conversion to porous stems, including the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem, the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology, the CLS Spotorno Stem from the CLS Hip System and the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip Stem, led hip stem sales, but those sales were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems. Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners also made strong contributions. In the U.S. hip market, we had some product gaps related to our acetabular cups which have affected sales growth. This was most noticeable in the area of metal on metal articulation. In November 2009, the Continuum Acetabular System and the Zimmer MMC Cup were cleared for sale in the U.S. These systems give surgeons a comprehensive array of acetabular cup solutions that, in concert with our comprehensive stem portfolio, provide additional patient matching options. These cups have also received approval in various countries outside the U.S. and will help complete our product portfolios in those countries as well. In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected hip sales by 6 percent. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales by 4 percent. Extremities The Bigliani/Flatow Complete Shoulder Solution and the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System led extremities sales. Trabecular Metal Technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market. Dental The Tapered Screw Vent Implant System led dental sales. Negative sales growth for our dental business reflects overall weakness in the global economy. We continue to believe the dental market will rebound as the global economy recovers and look forward to new opportunities as our product line is expanded through internal and external development efforts. Trauma Zimmer Periarticular Locking Plates and the ITST Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System led trauma sales but were partially offset by declining sales of compression hip screws. Femoral and tibial nails within the new Zimmer Natural Nail system also made a contribution during the year. Spine In the fourth quarter of 2008, we acquired Abbott Spine. As a result of the acquisition, spine sales have increased but the increase is offset in part by sales losses associated with the integration of the business. Solid sales of acquired fusion devices as well as legacy interbody devices and bone graft substitutes partly offset a significant decline in sales of the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System during the year. We expect our spinal business will continue to experience reimbursement challenges related to the Dynesys system. Following the November 2009 non approvable recommendation by the FDA advisory panel of our request for additional approved uses for the Dynesys system, we are exploring our options, which are presently uncertain. We believe that we generally have a solid portfolio of spine products as well as broad global distribution capabilities that should lead to improved performance over time. OSP and other OSP sales were led by PALACOS Bone Cement. OSP product sales growth improved in the second half of 2009 due to the effect of anniversarying out of the voluntary suspension and recall of certain products during 2008 and by the reintroduction of wound debridement products in 2009. 24 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT The following table presents estimated* 2009 global market size and market share information (dollars in billions): Global Zimmer Zimmer Market Global Market Market Market Size % Growth** Share Position Reconstructive Knees $ 6.4 5 % 27 % 1 Hips 5.8 4 21 2 Extremities 1.0 15 13 3 Total $ 13.2 5 24 1 Dental $ 3.3 (5 ) 6 5 Trauma $ 4.4 6 5 5 Spine*** $ 8.7 10 3 6 * Estimates are not precise and are based on competitor annual filings, Wall Street equity research and Company estimates ** Excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales growth *** Spine includes related orthobiologics Expenses as a Percent of Net Sales Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Inc (Dec) Cost of products sold 24.2 % 24.2 % Research and development 5.0 4.7 0.3 Selling, general and administrative 42.2 41.3 0.9 Certain claims 0.9 1.7 (0.8 ) Goodwill impairment 1.8 1.8 Acquisition, integration, realignment and other 1.8 1.6 0.2 Net curtailment and settlement (0.8 ) (0.8 ) Operating expenses 50.9 49.3 1.6 Operating profit 24.9 26.5 (1.6 ) Interest and other income (expense), net (0.5 ) 0.8 1.3 Cost of Products Sold Gross margin in 2009 was unchanged compared to 2008. Manufacturing costs per unit increased in 2009 due to lower production levels. Excess inventory and obsolescence charges increased in 2009 as a result of certain product specific matters and new product launches. These costs were offset by foreign currency hedge gains recognized in the 2009 period compared to hedge losses recognized in 2008. Under our hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings. The following table reconciles the gross margin for 2008 to 2009: Year ended December 31, 2008 gross margin 75.8 % Increased unit manufacturing costs (1.7 ) Excess and obsolete inventory (0.4 ) Foreign currency exchange impact, net 2.0 Other 0.1 Year ended December 31, 2009 gross margin 75.8 % Operating Expenses Research and development expense, or RD, increased to $205.4 million in 2009 from $192.3 million in 2008. This increase reflects additional spending on certain development, clinical and external research activities throughout 2009 in contrast to the delay in activities experienced in 2008 as we implemented our enhanced compliance program. Selling, general and administrative expense, or SGA, increased to $1,729.2 million in 2009, from $1,704.0 million in 2008. This is an increase of approximately 90 basis points compared to the prior year. SGA expense in the 2008 period included approximately $60 million of incremental costs, such as monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global roll out of our enhanced compliance program. The savings from these costs in 2009 have been offset by increased spending to fund enhanced medical education programs, Abbott Spine costs and increased product liability claims. In this challenging economic environment, we are carefully managing our SGA spend, reducing expenses in certain areas in order to fund growth and productivity initiatives. Areas of investment include marketing and promotion and medical education and training. The acquisition of Abbott Spine increased SGA costs for items such as selling expenses, increased instrument depreciation and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Additionally, SGA as a percentage of net sales is negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues caused by changes in foreign currency rates. A majority of our SGA spend is incurred in the U.S., primarily from our corporate headquarters and similar functions at our various businesses such as Dental, Trauma, Spine and OSP. Therefore, SGA expense does not respond to changes in foreign currency rates proportionally to our revenue, which has caused SGA as a percentage of net sales to increase. Certain claims expense is a provision for estimated Durom Cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified times. A provision of $69.0 million was originally recorded during 2008 with an additional $35.0 million recorded during 2009, bringing the total provision to $104.0 million for these claims. For more information regarding these claims, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2009, we noted that the carrying value of the assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit was in excess of its estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of $73.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. For more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of those five reporting units, the estimated fair value substantially exceeds its carrying value. 25 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses for 2009 were $75.3 million compared to $68.5 million in 2008. During 2009, we initiated a workforce realignment, which included the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support long term growth. As a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions, we incurred approximately $19.0 million of severance and termination related expenses. Other items in acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses in 2009 included approximately $9.4 million of expenses related to contract termination costs, $23.4 million of certain litigation matters that were recognized during the period and various costs incurred to integrate the Abbott Spine business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008. Included in acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses in 2008 was $38.5 million of in process research and development related to the Abbott Spine acquisition and other costs related to the integration of Abbott Spine. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these charges. We recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of $32.1 million during 2009 related to amending our U.S. and Puerto Rico postretirement benefit plans. For more information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for 2009 decreased 7 percent to $1,018.8 million from $1,090.0 million in 2008. The decrease in operating profit is due to higher operating expenses, most notably the goodwill impairment charge. Interest and other expense for 2009 increased to $20.6 million compared to income of $31.8 million in 2008. Interest and other income in 2008 included a realized gain of $38.8 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities. Interest expense increased in the 2009 period as the result of increased long term debt used to partially fund the Abbott Spine acquisition and the $1.0 billion senior notes offering during 2009. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes increased to 28.1 percent for 2009, up from 24.3 percent in 2008. The effective tax rate for 2009 is negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charge of $73.0 million recorded during 2009 for which no tax benefit was recorded. The effective tax rate for 2008 includes the impact of a current tax benefit of $31.7 million related to the 2007 settlement expense, resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent in the 2008 effective tax rate. This impact on the 2008 effective tax rate was partially offset by Abbott Spine acquisition related in process research and development charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded. These discrete items account for the majority of the change in our effective tax rate year over year. Net earnings decreased 15 percent to $717.4 million for 2009, compared to $848.6 million in 2008, as a result of decreased operating profit, increased interest expense and an increased effective tax rate. Basic earnings per share in 2009 decreased 10 percent to $3.34 from $3.73 in 2008. Diluted earnings per share decreased 11 percent to $3.32 from $3.72 in 2008. The disproportional change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2009 and 2008 share repurchases.

In addition, the Zimmer Unicompartmental High Flex Knee and the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System exhibited strong growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales by 5 percent in Europe and by 6 percent in Asia Pacific. Hips The continued conversion to porous stems, including the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem, the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology, the CLS Spotorno Stem from the CLS Hip System and the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip Stem, led hip stem sales, but those sales were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems. Trabecular Metal Acetabular Cups and Longevity Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners also had strong growth. The temporary suspension of marketing and distribution of the Durom Cup in the U.S. negatively impacted hip sales growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales by 5 percent in Europe and by 8 percent in Asia Pacific. Extremities The Bigliani/Flatow Complete Shoulder Solution and the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System led extremities sales. Dental Orthobiologicals and prosthetic implants, including strong growth of the Tapered Screw Vent Implant System, led dental sales. Trauma Zimmer Periarticular Locking Plates and the ITST Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System led trauma sales. Spine The Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System and the Trinica Select Anterior Cervical Plate System led spine sales, which also reflect an increase as a result of the Abbott Spine acquisition. OSP and other OSP sales were negatively affected by the patient care product recalls and related voluntary suspension of production of certain products, but these negative factors 27 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT were partially offset by strong growth in PALACOS Bone Cement.

Inventory step up related to the completion of the Abbott Spine acquisition during 2008 also had an unfavorable impact on gross margin. The following table reconciles the gross margin for 2007 to 2008: Year ended December 31, 2007 gross margin 77.5 % Foreign currency exchange impact, net (0.8 ) Excess and obsolete inventory (0.6 ) Inventory step up (0.2 ) Other (0.1 ) Year ended December 31, 2008 gross margin 75.8 % Operating Expenses RD increased to $192.3 million for 2008 from $182.6 million in 2007 but remained unchanged as a percent of total sales. The year over year increase represents our continued investment in RD to grow at or above sales growth. SGA expense increased to $1,704.0 million for 2008 from $1,516.7 million in 2007. Increased SGA costs include monitor fees paid as part of our 2007 civil settlement with the U.S. government regarding financial relationships with consulting orthopaedic surgeons, as well as consulting and legal fees associated with the global implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives. Expenses related to other operating initiatives also caused an increase in SGA as a percentage of net sales. Such operating initiatives include the planned implementation of a global IT system and improving quality systems at our Dover facility. Additionally, selling costs increased as a result of the ORTHOsoft acquisition, an increase in the headcount of our sales force in certain locations, increased commission incentives to sell certain key products and a change in the mix of commissions earned as a result of lower OSP sales. Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to the payment we made as part of the 2007 civil settlement. Certain claims expense of $69.0 million is a provision for estimated claims from Durom Cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified periods. For more information regarding these claims, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Acquisition, integration and other expenses increased to $68.5 million for 2008, compared to $25.2 million in 2007. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2008 include $38.5 million for in process research and development related to the Abbott Spine acquisition, costs related to the integration of Abbott Spine, facility consolidation costs, legal fees and retention and termination payments, partially offset by favorable adjustments to certain liabilities of acquired companies. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in process research and development write offs related to acquisitions, costs related to the integration of acquired U.S. distributors, estimated settlements for certain pre acquisition product liability claims, integration consulting fees and costs for integrating information technology systems. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these charges. Operating Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Operating profit for 2008 decreased 3 percent to $1,090.0 million from $1,127.6 million in 2007. Operating profit for 2007 included the effect of the non recurring settlement expense of $169.5 million. Excluding the impact of the settlement expense in 2007, operating profit for 2008 would still have been unfavorable compared to 2007 as a result of lower gross margins, increases in SGA costs attributable to the implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives and certain claims expense of $69.0 million. Interest and other income for 2008 increased to $31.8 million from $4.0 million in 2007. Interest and other income for 2008 includes a realized gain of $38.8 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities, partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of an increase in outstanding long term debt. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes decreased to 24.3 percent for 2008, down from 31.6 percent in 2007. The effective tax rate for the 2007 period reflects the effect of the $169.5 million settlement expense for which no tax benefit had previously been recognized. During 2008, we recorded a current tax benefit of $31.7 million related to the settlement expense, resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent to the current period effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2008 was further reduced as a result of increased profits in lower tax jurisdictions. These decreases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by Abbott Spine acquisition related in process research and development 28 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded. Net earnings increased 10 percent to $848.6 million for 2008 compared to $773.2 million in 2007, as the decrease in operating profit was more than offset by favorable items in interest and other income and a lower effective tax rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14 percent to $3.73 and $3.72, respectively, from $3.28 and $3.26 in 2007. The higher growth rate in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2008 and 2007 share repurchases. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,117.5 million in 2009 compared to $1,038.1 million in 2008. The principal source of cash from operating activities in 2009 was net earnings. Non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another $446.4 million of operating cash. All other items of operating cash flows in 2009 reflect a use of $46.3 million of cash. The resolution of outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted in increased cash outflows during the 2009 period compared to the delay in similar payments during the 2008 period as we implemented our enhanced global compliance program. The resolution of these outstanding payments, along with a change in the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the 2008 period and product liability payments, contributed to increased outflows from accrued expenses in 2009. These outflows were partially offset by improved accounts receivable collections and better inventory management. At December 31, 2009, we had 56 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable, a decrease of 3 days when compared to December 31, 2008, reflecting improved collections across all geographic segments. At December 31, 2009, we had 302 days of inventory on hand, a decrease of 42 days compared to December 31, 2008. Over the past two years we have made significant investments in inventory, including investments in response to growing demand for systems that provide more versatility and better fit for patients. In 2009 we made progress rationalizing these investments through reductions in field based consignments and through the use of new inventory management tools to speed returns and redeployments. The continued build out of pipeline inventory for planned product launches should partially offset these reductions in field consignments in 2010. Cash flows used in investing activities were $381.2 million in 2009 compared to $924.2 million in 2008. Additions to instruments decreased in 2009 compared to the 2008 period, as year over year spending on instruments declined compared to the significant investments made in 2008. In 2010, we expect to spend approximately $170 $180 million on instruments to support new products and sales growth. Spending on other property, plant and equipment decreased to $105.1 million during 2009 compared to $250.0 million in the same 2008 period. Spending on property, plant and equipment decreased compared to 2008 levels, as certain planned infrastructure initiatives from 2008 were completed and as we adjusted spending to lower production volumes. During 2010, we expect to purchase approximately $150 $160 million in other property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cash outlays necessary to complete new product related investments and normal replacement of older machinery and equipment. Acquired intellectual property rights were $35.8 million in 2009 compared to $109.4 million in 2008. These items relate to lump sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements. These lump sum payments were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the current net present value of the contractual arrangements. During 2009 we invested excess cash of approximately $66.4 million in certificates of deposit that have original maturities greater than 90 days. Investments in other assets in both 2009 and 2008 primarily relate to payments to acquire certain foreign based distributors. Investments in other assets in 2007 primarily related to payments to acquire Endius and ORTHOsoft. Included in investing cash flows in 2008 were $363.0 million paid to acquire Abbott Spine and $54.9 million of proceeds we received from the sale of certain equity securities. Cash flows used in financing activities were $262.1 million for 2009 compared to $343.5 million in 2008. In November 2009, we sold $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (Senior Notes) in a public offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $998.8 million, net of an offering discount of $1.2 million. We also paid an additional $8.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the sale of the Senior Notes. The proceeds of the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility, to finance our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes. We repurchased $923.7 million of our common stock in 2009 as compared with $737.0 million in 2008 under our stock repurchase programs. The Senior Notes include two tranches: $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due November 30, 2019, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due November 30, 2039. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on May 30 and November 30 of each year beginning on May 30, 2010 until maturity. The Senior Notes are rated A by Standard Poors Ratings Services and are rated Baa1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. We may redeem the Senior Notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis points, in the case of the 2019 notes, and 25 basis points, in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date. 29 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing November 30, 2012 (Senior Credit Facility). We had $128.8 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2009, and an availability of $1,221.2 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains provisions by which we can increase the line to $1,750 million. We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $84.1 million. We may use excess cash or further borrow against our Senior Credit Facility, subject to limits set by our Board of Directors, to repurchase additional common stock under the $1.25 billion program which expires December 31, 2010. Approximately $211.1 million remains authorized for future repurchases under this plan. Management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions): 2011 2013 2015 and and and Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2012 2014 Thereafter Long term debt $ 1,127.6 $ $ 128.8 $ $ 998.8 Interest payments 1,095.6 53.7 103.8 103.8 834.3 Operating leases 134.6 37.3 47.6 26.6 23.1 Purchase obligations 33.0 27.8 5.1 0.1 Long term income taxes payable 94.3 56.5 15.3 22.5 Other long term liabilities 234.2 81.7 26.2 126.3 Total contractual obligations $ 2,719.3 $ 118.8 $ 423.5 $ 172.0 $ 2,005.0 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below. Excess Inventory and Instruments We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in progress inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development 30 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. During 2009, in addition to our general product liability estimates and the $69.0 million provision recorded in 2008 related to the Durom Cup, we recorded an additional provision for certain claims of $35.0 million representing managements updated estimate of liability to Durom Cup patients undergoing revisions associated with surgeries occurring before July 2008 and within two years of the original surgery date. These parameters are consistent with our data which indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical technique are most likely to occur within that time period. We expect to pay the majority of these claims within the next three years. Any claims received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard product liability accruals. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined our U.S. Spine reporting units carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches. Fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. Factors that contributed to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit being below its carrying value included a decrease in projected revenues related to the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System. This product line experienced increased competition and insurance reimbursement issues in 2009. We have been seeking approval from the FDA to market this product differently in the U.S., which would enhance its position in the market. However, in November 2009 an FDA advisory panel issued a non approvable recommendation, increasing the uncertainty of the estimated future cash flows. In addition to the Dynesys product, revenues from other products have been affected as we work through the integration of the sales channel following the Abbott Spine acquisition. As a result, we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of $73.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of those five reporting units, the estimated fair value substantially exceeds its carrying value. Share based Payment We measure share based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively traded options. The expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Information about recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this report under Item 8. 31 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won and Swedish Krona. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. These forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won and Swedish Krona and purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2010 through June 2012. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $202.4 million and $207.5 million, respectively. The weighted average contract rates outstanding are Euro:USD 1.40, USD:Swiss Franc 1.10, USD:Japanese Yen 94, British Pound:USD 1.66, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.11, Australian Dollar:USD 0.75, USD:Korean Won 1,208 and USD:Swedish Krona 7.52. We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009 indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Korean Won and Swedish Krona, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2012, depending on the direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of $54.9 million, $20.5 million, $25.0 million, $10.2 million, $4.7 million, $9.9 million, $2.9 million and $1.8 million for the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Korean Won and Swedish Krona contracts, respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $2,346 million at December 31, 2009, primarily in Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately $1,309 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2009 relates to goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. As a result, foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a 32 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. INTEREST RATE RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities. Presently, we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in U.S. government treasury funds and bank deposits. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the variable rates associated with our credit facilities. Our Senior Notes have fixed interest rates and are not exposed to any risk from movement in interest rates. We are subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and our uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of our debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility bears interest at short term rates. We currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure, but we may do so in the future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2009, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on interest expense. Further, this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash equivalents, counterparty transactions and accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. However, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk. 33 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, the companys internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 34 ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2009 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT
