ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation. OVERVIEW We believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010. Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 3 percentage points of 2010 sales growth, which is 1 percentage point above the rate of growth from 2009 compared to 2008. We believe long term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the ongoing shift in demand to premium products, such as Longevity and Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes, Trabecular Metal Technology products, hip stems with Kinectiv Technology, high flex knees, knee revision products, porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices, is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth. Pricing Trends Global selling prices decreased 1 percent during 2010. Selling prices in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific decreased 1 percent, were flat, and decreased 2 percent, respectively, during 2010. We continue to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems. In the Americas, we have experienced compression of historic pricing differentials amongst our customers. Asia Pacific was especially influenced by a bi annual pricing adjustment in Japan that went into effect on April 1, 2010. Due to these pressures, we expect selling prices will continue to have a negative 1 to 2 percent effect on sales on a global basis in 2011. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates For 2010, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 1 percent increase in sales. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with 2010 year end rates, we estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2011 of approximately 1 percent on sales. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and, under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal. Global Economic Conditions We believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have negatively affected elective hospital procedures. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we saw some stabilization in procedure volumes and we believe the number of procedures will increase as the global economy strengthens. Despite the current conditions of the global economy, it is well known that demographic trends will expand the patient base that needs our products. We believe these factors will ultimately foster long term sustained growth even if in the short term the timing of these elective procedures continues to be adversely affected. 2011 Outlook We estimate our sales will grow between 3 and 5 percent in 2011. Such sales growth assumes knee and hip procedures will grow in low single digits with modest global economic growth and relatively stable employment. As discussed previously, we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth by 1 to 2 percent, and foreign currency exchange rates to have a positive effect on sales growth by approximately 1 percent based upon December 31, 2010 rates. Assuming currency rates remain at December 31, 2010 rates, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 75 percent of sales in 2011. This takes into account anticipated losses from foreign currency hedge losses resulting from relative weakness in the U.S. Dollar. We expect to continue making investments in research and development (RD) in the range of 5 to 6 percent of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) as a percent of sales is expected to be between 40 and 41 percent as we realize operational efficiencies from global restructuring and transformation initiatives and leverage revenue growth. We expect to incur $75 to $80 million of expenses in 2011 related to certain global restructuring and transformation initiatives. We also expect to incur an additional $15 to $20 million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions. We anticipate recognizing some of the $90 to $100 million in cost of products sold and the majority in Special items on our statement of net earnings. The gross margin and SGA percentages discussed above do not include these expenses. We expect interest and other expense to be approximately $50 million in 2011, which is slightly lower than 2010 as we have entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert a portion of our $1 billion senior notes from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. 22 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales by Reportable Segment The following tables present net sales by reportable segment and the components of the percentage changes (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Volume/ Foreign 2010 2009 % Inc/(Dec) Mix Price Exchange Americas $ 2,431.6 $ 2,372.4 2 % 3 % (1 )% % Europe 1,099.5 1,119.2 (2 ) 1 (3 ) Asia Pacific 689.1 603.8 14 8 (2 ) 8 Total $ 4,220.2 $ 4,095.4 3 3 (1 ) 1 Year Ended December 31, Volume/ Foreign 2009 2008 % Inc/(Dec) Mix Price Exchange Americas $ 2,372.4 $ 2,353.9 1 % 2 % (1 )% % Europe 1,119.2 1,179.1 (5 ) 1 (6 ) Asia Pacific 603.8 588.1 3 1 (1 ) 3 Total $ 4,095.4 $ 4,121.1 (1 ) 2 (1 ) (2 ) Foreign Exchange as used in the tables in this report represents the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales growth.

Our knee sales have been affected by broader economic conditions impacting volume/mix and competitive pressures from newer knee systems that have more modern surgical instruments for implantation. We intend to counter these competitive pressures in 2011 and thereafter as we continue to launch our new patient specific and posterior referencing instrumentation systems, as well as through new product development. The NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, including Gender Solutions Knee Femoral Implants, the NexGen LPS Flex Knee and the NexGen CR Flex Knee, together with the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System led knee sales. In addition, sales of partial knee devices, including the Zimmer Unicompartmental Knee and the recently released Gender Solutions Patello Femoral Joint, exhibited growth. In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected knee sales in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by 2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by 10 percent and zero percent, respectively. Hips Hip sales rebounded from negative growth in 2009 to positive growth in 2010 driven by new product introductions, such as our Continuum Acetabular System and our Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology. The Zimmer M/L Taper Stem, the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology, the CLS Spotorno Stem from the CLS Hip System and the Alloclassic Zweymller Hip Stem led hip stem sales. In addition, sales of revision hip products, such as the ZMR Hip System and the Trabecular Metal Revision Shell and Augment Cups, were strong when compared to the prior year periods, as were sales of Fitmore Hip Stems. In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected hip sales in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by 2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Extremities Extremities sales have grown by low double digits the past two years led by the Bigliani/Flatow Complete Shoulder Solution and the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System. Trabecular Metal Technology is playing a critical role 24 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market. Dental Dental sales have experienced a significant turnaround from a negative 10 percent decline in 2009 to positive 7 percent growth in 2010. In 2009, our dental sales were affected more by the global economic environment than our other product categories, as many dental procedures are not reimbursed by third party payors. Sales were led by the Tapered Screw Vent Implant System. Additionally, regenerative products have exhibited strong sales growth in 2010. Trauma Trauma sales increased in the mid single digits the past two years. Zimmer Periarticular Locking Plates and the ITST Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System led trauma sales, while sales of cable products also made a strong contribution. In 2009, we initiated the launch of the Zimmer Natural Nail System, which made a strong contribution to 2010 sales. We anticipate that a broader launch of that system will continue to positively affect sales growth. Spine In the fourth quarter of 2008 we acquired Abbott Spine. As a result of the acquisition, spine sales increased in 2009, but underlying that performance were sales losses associated with integration of the business. In 2010, once we anniversaried out of the additional sales from the acquisition, we experienced sales declines, most notably in our Americas segment. In addition to the operational challenges associated with the integration of the Abbott Spine business in the Americas, a difficult reimbursement landscape and a significant decline in our Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System have affected sales. In contrast to the Americas, our spine sales grew in Europe and Asia Pacific in 2010 driven by the stabilization of our distribution channels, which followed the Abbott Spine integration activity of 2009. Overall, solid sales of the PathFinder and Sequoia Pedicle Screw Systems, our Universal Clamp System and our Trinica Anterior Cervical Plate System partly offset a decline in sales of the Dynesys System. Surgical and other Surgical and other sales went from 1 percent sales growth in 2009 to 13 percent sales growth in 2010. In 2008, we voluntarily recalled and suspended production of certain patient care products, and were able to reintroduce those products during the year in 2009. Accordingly, 2009 sales were suppressed, especially in the first half of the year, but we started to regain market share in the second half of 2009 and throughout 2010. Surgical sales were led by PALACOS Bone Cement, wound debridement products, tourniquet products and powered instruments.

In the last half of 2009 and early 2010, lower production levels caused our manufacturing costs per unit to be higher, resulting in increased costs in both 2010 and 2009. In 2010, the higher unit costs were offset by lower excess and obsolescence charges resulting from improved inventory management and certain product specific matters that were experienced in 2009 which did not recur in 2010. Foreign currency hedging also affects our gross margin. Under our hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings. In 2010 and 2009, we recognized hedge gains in cost of products sold with 2010 gains being less than 2009 gains. In 2008, we recognized foreign currency hedge losses. 25 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT The following table reconciles the gross margin changes for 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Prior year gross margin 75.8 % 75.8 % Increased unit manufacturing costs (0.8 ) (1.7 ) Excess and obsolete inventory 0.9 (0.4 ) Foreign currency exchange impact, net (0.4 ) 2.0 Inventory step up 0.3 (0.1 ) Other 0.2 0.2 Current year gross margin 76.0 % 75.8 % Operating Expenses RD expense and RD as a percent of sales has increased in each of the last two years. These increases are in line with our strategy to invest in new product development activities across nearly all of our product categories, as well as to increase spending on external research, clinical, regulatory and quality initiatives. Additionally, in 2008 we experienced some delay in RD activities as we implemented enhancements to our compliance program. We continue to expect RD spending to be between 5 to 6 percent of sales in 2011. SGA has increased in dollars terms over the last three years, but as a percent of sales was lower in 2010 and 2008 compared to 2009. In 2010, SGA increased in dollar terms from 2009 primarily for variable selling and distribution expenses as 2010 sales were higher than 2009 sales, and from increased spending to fund medical education programs. SGA as a percent of sales in 2010 decreased by 60 basis points from 2009, reflecting disciplined spending combined with a higher base of sales, and no expense in 2010 related to corporate monitoring that ended after the first quarter of 2009. In 2009, SGA as a percent of sales increased approximately 90 basis points compared to 2008. SGA expense in the 2008 period included approximately $60 million of incremental costs, such as monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global roll out of enhancements to our compliance program. The savings from these costs in 2009 were offset by increased spending to fund enhanced medical education programs, Abbott Spine costs and increased product liability claims. The acquisition of Abbott Spine increased SGA costs for items such as selling expenses, increased instrument depreciation and amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Additionally, SGA as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues caused by changes in foreign currency rates. A majority of our SGA spend is incurred in the U.S., primarily from our corporate headquarters and similar functions at our various businesses such as Dental, Trauma, Spine and Surgical. Therefore, SGA expense does not respond to changes in foreign currency rates proportionally to our revenue, which caused SGA as a percentage of net sales to increase in 2009 compared to 2008. Certain claims expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to Durom Cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. Provisions of $35.0 million and $69.0 million were originally recorded during 2009 and 2008, respectively, with an additional $75.0 million recorded during 2010, bringing the total provision to $179.0 million for these claims. For more information regarding these claims, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, we noted that the carrying values of the assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting units estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $204.0 million and $73.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimate the fair values of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of those five other reporting units, the estimated fair values substantially exceed their carrying value. We recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of $32.1 million during 2009 related to amending our U.S. and Puerto Rico postretirement benefit plans. For more information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Special items expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $34.7 million, $75.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively. 2010 includes expenses related to restructuring of our information technology infrastructure as well as our management structure. This resulted in $7.7 million of asset impairment charges and $6.7 million of employee severance and termination related expenses. We have also incurred consulting and professional fees, facility and employee relocation costs, contract termination expenses and other various expenses resulting from our acquisitions of Abbott Spine, Beijing Montagne Medical Device Co., Ltd, and third party distributors. Special items also includes the impairment of an available for sale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters. Special items in 2009 included a workforce realignment, which resulted in the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support long term growth. As a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions, we incurred approximately $19.0 million of severance and termination related expenses. Other Special items in 2009 included approximately $9.4 million of expenses related to contract termination costs, $23.4 million of certain litigation matters that were recognized during the period and various costs incurred to integrate the Abbott Spine business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008. Included in Special items in 2008 was $38.5 million of in process research and development related to the Abbott Spine acquisition and other costs related to the integration of Abbott Spine. 26 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Special items charges. Interest and Other, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Interest and other expense has increased over the past three years. Interest and other expense increased in 2010 over 2009 due to the $1.0 billion senior unsecured notes that we issued in November 2009. As a result, in 2010 we had a full year of interest on these notes. Interest and other expense in 2009 increased over 2008 as the result of long term debt incurred to partially fund the Abbott Spine acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of the senior unsecured notes in November 2009. Interest and other income in 2008 included a realized gain of $38.8 million related to the sale of certain marketable securities. The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 has been 30.6 percent, 28.1 percent and 24.3 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 are negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charges of $204.0 million and $73.0 million, respectively, for which no tax benefit was recorded. The goodwill impairment charges have increased the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by approximately 6 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Additionally, in 2010 the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies. The effective tax rate for 2008 includes the impact of a current tax benefit of $31.7 million related to a 2007 U.S. government civil settlement expense, resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent in the 2008 effective tax rate. This impact on the 2008 effective tax rate was partially offset by Abbott Spine acquisition related in process research and development charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded. These discrete items account for the majority of the change in our effective tax rates in the past three years. As a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously, net earnings in 2010 decreased 17 percent compared to 2009. In 2009, net earnings decreased 15 percent compared to 2008. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 11 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, while 2009 basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 10 percent and 11 percent, respectively, from 2008. The disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases made in the last three years. Non GAAP operating performance measures We use non GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our non GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step up charges, Special items, Certain claims, Net curtailment and settlement and Goodwill impairment, and the taxes on those items and the tax benefit related to a 2007 civil settlement. We use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of our on going operating results, it helps to better identify operating trends and perform trend analysis that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items, and provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items. Certain of these non GAAP financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs. Our non GAAP adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $871.6 million, $849.9 million, and $924.3 million, respectively, and our non GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.33, $3.94, and $4.05, respectively. Our non GAAP adjusted net earnings increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased sales, disciplined spending in SGA, and the absence of monitor related expenses in 2010. Such increases to non GAAP adjusted net earnings were slightly offset by increased RD and medical education expenses and increased interest expense from the senior unsecured notes issued in 2009. Our non GAAP adjusted net earnings decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 as lower sales and higher RD and medical education expenses reduced non GAAP adjusted net earnings. Additionally, 2008 non GAAP adjusted net earnings featured a $38.8 million pre tax gain related to sales of certain marketable securities. The 2009 period did contain some expense savings such as the $60 million of incremental savings related to monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated with the global roll out of enhancements to our compliance program, but such savings were not enough to offset the other items that reduced non GAAP adjusted net earnings. The following are reconciliations from our GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our non GAAP adjusted net earnings and non GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes.

Healthcare Reform in the U.S. We continue to assess the impact that the healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010 by the U.S. federal government will have on our business. The new law includes a 2.3 percent excise tax on a majority of our U.S. sales that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,193.5 million in 2010 compared to $1,117.5 million in 2009. The principal source of cash from operating activities in 2010 was net earnings. Non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another $535.1 million of operating cash. All other items of operating cash flows in 2010 provided $61.5 million of cash. The resolution of outstanding payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted in increased cash outflows during the 2009 period compared to the delay in similar payments during the 2008 period as we implemented enhancements to our compliance program. The resolution of these outstanding payments, along with a change in the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the 2008 period and product liability payments, contributed to increased outflows from accrued expenses in 2009. Accrued expenses did not have any such significant variations in 2010, thus reflecting lower outflows in 2010 in our indirect statement of cash flows when compared to 2009. We have paid approximately $45 million and $25 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to Durom Cup product liability claims. We estimate the remaining liability for Durom Cup claims as of December 31, 2010, is $132.8 million. We expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next three years. At December 31, 2010, we had 58 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable, an increase of 2 days when compared to December 31, 2009, reflecting some changes in collection practices that may have slightly increased days sales outstanding, but have decreased our costs to collect at an acceptable risk level. At December 31, 2010, we had 307 days of inventory on hand, a slight increase of 5 days compared to December 31, 2009. Cash flows used in investing activities were $726.9 million in 2010, compared to $381.2 million in 2009. Additions to instruments increased in 2010 compared to the 2009 period to support new product launches, such as our Continuum Acetabular System, and as we introduced new instrumentation in our knee product category such as posterior referencing instrumentation. In 2011, we expect to spend approximately $140 to $150 million on instruments to support new products and sales growth. Spending on other property, plant and equipment decreased in 2010 compared to the 2009 period as there were no significant infrastructure initiatives in 2010. During 2011, we expect to purchase approximately $110 to $120 million in other property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cash outlays necessary to complete new product related investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment. Beginning in 2009 and with more significance in 2010, we began investing some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated debt securities. The purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. Acquired intellectual property rights decreased to $8.5 million in 2010 compared to $35.8 million in 2009 and $109.4 million in 2008. These items relate to lump sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements. These lump sum payments were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the current net present value of the contractual arrangements. Included in investing cash flows in 2008 were $363.0 million paid to acquire Abbott Spine and $54.9 million of proceeds we received from the sale of certain equity securities. In the past three years, we have made other smaller business acquisitions including Beijing Montagne Medical Device Co., Ltd., Sodem Diffusion S.A. and foreign based distributors. Cash flows used in financing activities were $489.6 million for 2010, compared to $262.1 million in 2009. In 2010, the only significant cash we used in financing activities related to the repurchase of $505.6 million of our common stock. In November 2009, we sold $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (Senior Notes) in a public offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $998.8 million, net of an offering discount of $1.2 million. We also paid an additional $8.5 million of debt issuance costs related to the sale of the Senior Notes. We used cash from operating cash flows and some of the proceeds from the Senior Notes to repurchase $923.7 million of our common stock in 2009. The Senior Notes include two tranches: $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent Senior Notes due November 30, 2019, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent Senior Notes due November 30, 2039. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on May 30 and November 30 of each year until maturity. We may redeem the Senior Notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion of such payments of 28 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis points, in the case of the 2019 notes, and 25 basis points, in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date. We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing November 30, 2012 (Senior Credit Facility). We had $141.8 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2010, and an availability of $1,208.2 million. We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $77.8 million. We place our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We invest only in high quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy. As of December 31, 2010 we had short term and long term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $410.6 million. These investments are in debt securities of many different counterparties and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single counterparty. All these debt securities are highly rated and therefore we believe the risk of default by the counterparties is low. As of December 31, 2010, $725.3 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the U.S and expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. Repatriation of these assets to the U.S. would have negative tax consequences. Approximately $550 million of this amount is denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk. The remaining is denominated in the various currencies where we operate. We may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $1.2 billion remained authorized under a $1.5 billion repurchase program, which will expire on December 31, 2013. Management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions): 2012 2014 2016 and and and Contractual Obligations Total 2011 2013 2015 Thereafter Long term debt $ 1,141.8 $ $ 141.8 $ $ 1,000.0 Interest payments 1,044.5 53.6 104.6 103.8 782.5 Operating leases 142.7 44.6 50.0 23.1 25.0 Purchase obligations 27.1 26.1 1.0 Other long term liabilities 232.9 149.3 31.9 51.7 Total contractual obligations $ 2,589.0 $ 124.3 $ 446.7 $ 158.8 $ 1,859.2 Approximately 8 percent of the other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. Defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. Due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions on voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2011. Therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans. Also included in other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. Due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. Therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to uncertain tax benefits. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these uncertain tax benefits. We have entered into various contractual agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product RD milestones, sales milestones, or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. Since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. These payments could range from $0 to $60 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below. Excess Inventory and Instruments We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of 29 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in process inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. In addition to our general product liability, we have recorded Certain claims provisions totaling $179.0 million related to the Durom Cup, including $75.0 million in 2010. The additional provision was needed in 2010 in part because we revised the definition of Certain claims recorded in our statement of earnings to include worldwide claims relating to all revisions of Durom Cup cases where the original surgery was performed before our July 22, 2008 suspension of marketing and distribution, regardless of the time period elapsed between the original surgery and the revision surgery. This additional provision represents managements updated estimate of liability to Durom Cup patients undergoing revisions associated with original surgeries occurring before July 22, 2008. The remaining liability as of December 31, 2010 is $132.8 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets. As of December 31, 2010, we had intangible assets of $210.7 million related to trademarks and trade names, of which $197.3 million are classified as having an indefinite life. We currently have and anticipate future product development efforts that may replace the current products that use those trademarks and trade names. While it is possible, it is not known if these new products will utilize these trademarks and trade names. If these new products do not use these trademarks and trade names, these assets may be impaired. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined our U.S. Spine reporting units carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches. Fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the U.S. Spine reporting unit of $204.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. In the year ended December 31, 30 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT 2009, we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of $73.0 million. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges. We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of those five reporting units, the estimated fair values substantially exceed their carrying value. Share based Payment We measure share based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. The expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 31 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. These forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees and purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2011 through June 2013. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2010 were $1.4 billion. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2010 were $212.1 million. The weighted average contract rates outstanding at December 31, 2010 were Euro:USD 1.35, USD:Swiss Franc 1.04, USD:Japanese Yen 87.20, British Pound:USD 1.57, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.07, Australian Dollar:USD 0.82, USD:Korean Won 1,231, USD:Swedish Krona 7.32, USD:Czech Koruna 19.57, USD:Thai Baht 31.27, USD:Taiwan Dollar 30.62, USD:South African Rand 7.85, USD:Russian Ruble 32.24 and USD:Indian Ruppee 48.08. We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010 indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2012, depending on the direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of $59.8 million, $19.8 million, $36.1 million, $11.3 million, $7.2 million, $12.6 million, $1.7 million, $2.3 million, $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $1.7 million, $0.5 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately $2,250 million at December 31, 2010, primarily in Euros and Japanese Yen. Approximately $1,295 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2010 relates to goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. As a result, foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate 32 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT the effect of market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. INTEREST RATE RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities. We invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits. We also have short term and long term investments in highly rated corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, U.S. government treasury funds, municipal bonds, foreign government debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents. Presently, all of our debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility bears interest at short term rates. In December 2010, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of $250 million that hedge a portion of our $500 million 4.625 percent Senior Notes due November 30, 2019. On the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2010, we receive a fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and we pay variable interest equal to the three month LIBOR plus an average of 133 basis points. The interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. The objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under U.S. GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2010, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on net interest expense. This analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, derivative instruments, counterparty transactions and accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. However, essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate. While we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry where we do business, there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer. 33 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, the companys internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 34 ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2010 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT
