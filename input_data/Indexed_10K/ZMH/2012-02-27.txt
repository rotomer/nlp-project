ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2010 and 2009 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation. OVERVIEW We believe the following developments or trends are important in understanding our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011. Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4 percentage points of 2011 sales growth, which is 1 percentage point above the rate of growth from 2010 compared to 2009. Volume and mix trends continued to be challenged by the global economy. We believe reconstructive procedure volumes in 2011 continued to be lower than historical utilization rates and lower than demographic trends would indicate. This effect was particularly pronounced in our Americas operating segment, where the impact of ongoing high unemployment and low consumer confidence contributed to softness. Long term indicators still point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, obesity, more active lifestyles, growth in emerging markets, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and proven clinical benefits of joint replacement procedures. In addition, the ongoing shift in demand to premium products, such as Prolong Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene, Trabecular Metal Technology products, hip stems with Kinectiv Technology, high flex knees, porous hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices, is expected to continue to positively affect sales growth. Pricing Trends Global average selling prices declined by 1 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. Selling prices in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific declined by 2 percent, were flat, and declined by 1 percent, respectively, during 2011. We continue to see pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems. Due to these pressures and a biannual price adjustment in Japan in April 2012, we expect selling prices will have approximately a negative 2 percent effect on sales on a global basis in 2012. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates For 2011, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a 2 percent increase in sales. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with 2011 year end rates, we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in 2012 of approximately 1 percent on sales. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal. Global Economic Conditions We believe adverse conditions in the global economy continue to negatively affect elective hospital procedures. However, we continue to believe that procedure deferrals will diminish slowly over time, and that growth rates will trend higher as they track more in line with historical usage rates among the aging population. We believe these demographic trends will ultimately foster long term sustained growth even if in the short term the timing of these elective procedures continues to be adversely affected. 2012 Outlook We estimate our sales will grow between 1 and 3 percent in 2012. Such sales growth assumes knee and hip procedures will grow in low single digits with modest global economic growth and relatively stable employment. As discussed previously, we expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth of 2 percent, and foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative effect on sales growth of approximately 1 percent based upon December 31, 2011 rates. Assuming currency rates remain at December 31, 2011 levels, we expect our gross margin to be between 74 and 75 percent of sales in 2012. This takes into account the cost pressures we have experienced from lower than planned manufacturing volumes, as well as anticipated losses from foreign currency hedges. However, if currency rates remain at December 31, 2011 levels the hedge losses we recognize in 2012 will be less than the hedge losses recognized in 2011. We expect to continue making investments in research and development (R&D) in the range of 5 to 6 percent of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percent of sales is expected to be between 39.5 and 40.5 percent as we realize operational efficiencies from global restructuring and transformation initiatives and further leverage revenue growth. We expect to incur approximately $100 million of expenses in 2012 related to certain restructuring and transformation initiatives. The programs are targeted at streamlining the organization and business processes. They 22 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT are expected to be mostly completed in 2012. We also expect to incur approximately $10 million for certain acquisition and integration costs connected with recent acquisitions. We expect to recognize the majority of these $110 million of expenses in Special items on our statement of net earnings. The gross margin and SG&A percentages discussed above do not include these expenses. Assuming variable rates remain at December 31, 2011 levels, we expect interest income and expense, net, to be approximately $65 million in 2012, which is higher than 2011 primarily due to a $550 million offering of senior notes completed in November 2011.

We estimate that industry procedure volumes were flat to slightly positive on a global basis in 2011, while pricing was negative. We believe procedure volumes will continue to be pressured from a cyclical downturn related to uncertain global economic conditions. The NexGen Complete Knee Solution product line, including Gender Solutions Knee Femoral Implants, the NexGen LPS Flex Knee and the NexGen CR Flex Knee, together with the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System, led knee sales. In addition, sales of the Gender Solutions Patello Femoral Joint and Zimmer Patient Specific Instruments exhibited growth. In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 by positive 4 percent and negative 2 percent, respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 by 9 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Hips Hip sales grew by 7 percent in 2011 driven by new product introductions, such as our Continuum Acetabular System and our Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology. Additionally, negative publicity in the marketplace over the use of hip systems that use metal on metal technology may have contributed to an increase in sales of hip systems with alternative bearing surfaces. Metal on metal technology represents only a small portion of our hip sales. Therefore, our market share position may have benefited from customers using our hip systems instead of a competitors metal on metal system. The Zimmer M/L Taper Stem, the Zimmer M/L Taper Stem with Kinectiv Technology, the CLS Spotorno Stem from the CLS Hip System and the Alloclassic Zweym&uuml;ller Hip Stem led hip stem sales. In addition, sales of the Continuum Acetabular System, Trilogy IT Acetabular System and Allofit IT Alloclassic Acetabular System and the Trabecular Metal Revision Shell and Augment Cups were strong when compared to the prior year periods, as were sales of BIOLOX delta Heads and Fitmore Hip Stems. In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 by positive 6 percent and negative 2 percent, respectively. In Asia Pacific, our December 2010 acquisition of Beijing Montagne Medical Device Co., Ltd. made a contribution to that operating segments sales growth in 2011. Additionally in Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 by 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Extremities Extremities delivered solid sales growth the past two years, led by the Zimmer Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder System and the Bigliani/Flatow Complete Shoulder Solution. Trabecular Metal Technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market. We continue to see competitive pressure in this category, but expect that new product and instrument introductions will help to accelerate growth. Dental Dental experienced sales growth of 13 percent in 2011 compared to 7 percent growth in 2010, including a 7 percent increase in 2011 due to pricing. A significant portion of this pricing increase was due to a change in the agreement that started in the fourth quarter of 2010 by which we distribute certain regenerative products. Under the prior agreement, we did not take title to the products and only received a commission from the end user sale. Under the new agreement, we take title to the product and recognize the final end user sale along with the cost of products sold and any other selling related costs. Sales were led by the Tapered Screw Vent Implant System. Trauma Trauma sales increased by 16 percent in 2011 after experiencing 5 percent sales growth in 2010. In 2011, we continued the launch of the Zimmer Natural Nail System, which contributed significantly to our trauma sales. In addition to the Zimmer Natural Nail System, Zimmer Periarticular Locking Plates and the Zimmer NCB Plating System led trauma sales, while sales of cable products also made a strong contribution. Spine We experienced mid to high single digit sales declines in Spine each of the past two years. The sales declines have come from our Americas segment, as both Europe and Asia Pacific have experienced sales growth in each of the past two years. In the Americas segment, we have experienced operational challenges with our sales force, a difficult reimbursement landscape and a significant decline in sales of our Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System. Overall, solid sales of the PathFinder and Sequoia Pedicle Screw Systems, our Universal Clamp System and Trabecular Metal Technology products partly offset a decline in sales of the Dynesys System. Surgical and other Surgical and other delivered solid sales growth the past two years. Surgical and other sales were led by PALACOS Bone Cement and tourniquet products. Our wound debridement products also made a strong contribution to sales results, as did our December 2010 acquisition of Sodem Diffusion S.A. 25 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT The following table presents estimated* 2011 global market size and market share information (dollars in billions): GlobalMarketSize Global Market% Growth** ZimmerMarketShare ZimmerMarketPosition Reconstructive Knees $ 7.2 % 26 % 1 Hips 6.3 2 21 2 Extremities 1.4 10 12 3 Total $ 14.9 1 23 1 Dental $ 3.3 4 8 5 Trauma $ 5.5 5 5 4 Spine*** $ 9.3 1 2 7 * Estimates are not precise and are based on competitor annual filings, Wall Street equity research and Company estimates ** Excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales growth *** Spine includes related orthobiologics Expenses as a Percent of Net Sales Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 vs. 2010Inc (Dec) 2010 vs. 2009Inc (Dec) Cost of products sold 25.2 % 24.0 % 24.2 % 1.2 (0.2 ) Research and development 5.4 5.2 5.0 0.2 0.2 Selling, general and administrative 41.2 41.6 42.2 (0.4 ) (0.6 ) Certain claims 3.5 1.8 0.9 1.7 0.9 Goodwill impairment 4.8 1.8 (4.8 ) 3.0 Net curtailment and settlement (0.8 ) 0.8 Special items 1.7 0.8 1.8 0.9 (1.0 ) Operating margin 23.0 21.7 24.9 1.3 (3.2 ) Cost of Products Sold Gross margin declined in 2011 after minimal change from 2009 to 2010. The most significant impact on gross margin in 2011 was from our foreign currency hedging program. Under the program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects earnings. Due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar in 2011, we recognized foreign currency hedge losses in costs of products sold versus hedge gains in 2010. Also in 2011, lower selling prices, higher average costs per unit sold, and higher inventory step up charges all contributed to lower gross margins. In 2010, lower average selling prices, higher average costs per unit sold and the impact of our hedging program also negatively affected gross margin, but were offset by lower excess and obsolescence charges from improved inventory management and certain product specific matters that were experienced in 2009 which did not recur in 2010. The following table reconciles the gross margin changes for 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Prior year gross margin 76.0 % 75.8 % Lower average selling prices (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Increased average cost per unit (0.2 ) (0.6 ) Excess and obsolete inventory 0.9 Foreign currency exchange impact, net (1.0 ) (0.4 ) Inventory step up (0.2 ) 0.3 Other 0.4 0.2 Current year gross margin 74.8 % 76.0 % Operating Expenses R&D expense and R&D expense as a percent of sales increased in each of the last two years. These increases are in line with our strategy to invest in new product development activities across nearly all of our product categories, as well as to increase spending on external research, clinical, regulatory and quality initiatives. We continue to expect R&D spending to be between 5 to 6 percent of sales in 2012. SG&A has increased in dollars terms over the last three years, but has decreased as a percent of sales. In 2011, SG&A increased in dollar terms from 2010 primarily due to variable selling and distribution expenses from higher sales, increased intangible asset amortization from acquisitions completed in December 2010 and higher bad debt expenses primarily from our Europe operating segment. These were partially offset by lower product liability charges recorded in SG&A related to the Durom Cup. For more information regarding Durom Cup claims, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased by 40 basis points from 2010 reflecting disciplined spending and the effect of our transformation initiatives, which has lowered expenses such as salaries, wages and benefits. In 2010, SG&A increased in dollar terms from 2009 primarily due to variable selling and distribution expenses from higher sales and from increased spending to fund medical education programs. SG&A as a percent of sales in 2010 decreased by 60 basis points from 2009, reflecting disciplined spending combined with a higher base of sales, and no expense in 2010 related to corporate monitoring that ended after the first quarter of 2009. Certain claims expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to Durom Cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. Provisions of $75.0 million, $35.0 million and $69.0 million were originally recorded during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, with an additional $157.8 million recorded during 2011, bringing the total provision to $336.8 million for these claims, excluding a subset of Durom Cup claims that were recorded in SG&A. For more information regarding these claims, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, we noted that the carrying values of the net assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting units estimated 26 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT fair value. As a result, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $204.0 million and $73.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the impairment, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. We recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of $32.1 million during 2009 related to amending our U.S. and Puerto Rico postretirement benefit plans. For more information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Special items expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $75.2 million, $34.7 million, and $75.3 million, respectively. In 2011, we continued reducing management layers and restructured certain areas, resulting in $23.1 million of severance and termination related expenses. In 2011, we also incurred $26.0 million in consulting and professional fees associated with acquisitions and our business transformation initiatives. As a result of our acquisitions and transformation initiatives, we also incurred asset impairments, facility and employee relocation costs, contract termination expenses and other costs. Special items in 2010 included expenses related to restructuring of our information technology infrastructure as well as our management structure. This resulted in $7.7 million of asset impairment charges and $6.7 million of employee severance and termination related expenses. In 2010, we also incurred consulting and professional fees, facility and employee relocation costs, contract termination expenses and other various expenses resulting from acquisitions. Special items also included the impairment of an available for sale security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and certain litigation related matters. Special items in 2009 included a workforce realignment, which resulted in the elimination of positions in some areas and increases in others to support long term growth. As a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions, we incurred approximately $19.0 million of severance and termination related expenses. Other Special items in 2009 included approximately $9.4 million of expenses related to contract termination costs, $23.4 million related to certain litigation matters that were recognized during the period and various costs related to acquisitions. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Special items charges. Interest Income, Interest Expense, Income Taxes and Net Earnings Interest expense decreased in 2011 after a significant increase in 2010 from 2009. In November 2009 we issued $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes which was the primary cause of the increase in 2010. The decrease in interest expense in 2011 is the result of interest rate swap agreements we entered into in late 2010 and early 2011 to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. Interest income has increased due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments and higher returns on certain investments. Our effective tax rate (ETR) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 22.4 percent, 30.6 percent and 28.1 percent, respectively. The variation of our ETR has largely been affected by Certain claims and goodwill impairment charges. Certain claims expense favorably affects our ETR because it lowers the income within our U.S. operations relative to our foreign operations. Goodwill impairment charges negatively affect our ETR because no tax benefit is recorded on such charges. Additionally, in 2011 and 2010 our ETR was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies. These discrete items account for the majority of the variation in our ETRs in the past three years. As a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously, net earnings in 2011 increased 27 percent compared to 2010. In 2010, net earnings decreased 17 percent compared to 2009. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 36 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, while 2010 basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 11 percent from 2009. The disproportionate change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of share repurchases. Non GAAP operating performance measures We use non GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our non GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step up charges, Special items, Certain claims, net curtailment and settlement and goodwill impairment, and the taxes on those items in addition to certain other tax adjustments. We use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period to period comparisons of our ongoing operating results, it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items, and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items. Certain of these non GAAP financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs. Our non GAAP adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $905.6 million, $871.6 million, and $849.9 million, respectively, and our non GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.80, $4.33, and $3.94, respectively. 27 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT The following are reconciliations from our GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our non GAAP adjusted net earnings and non GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes.

Healthcare Reform in the U.S. We continue to assess the impact that federal healthcare reform will have on our business. Federal healthcare reform includes a 2.3 percent excise tax on a majority of our U.S. sales that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,176.9 million in 2011 compared to $1,193.5 million in 2010. The principal source of cash from operating activities in 2011 was net earnings. Non cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another $412.1 million of operating cash. All other items of operating cash flows in 2011 provided $4.8 million of cash. The lower cash flows provided by operating activities in the 2011 period were primarily due to lower receivable collections and increased product liability payments. We paid approximately $60 million, $45 million and $25 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to Durom Cup product liability claims. We estimate the net remaining liability after insurance recovery for Durom Cup claims as of December 31, 2011, is $234.8 million. We expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next five years. At December 31, 2011, we had 64 days of sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable, an increase of 6 days when compared to December 31, 2010, reflecting changes in certain accounts receivable factoring programs and the economic environment in our Europe operating segment. At December 31, 2011, we had 277 days of inventory on hand, a decrease of 30 days compared to December 31, 2010. Days of inventory on hand have decreased due to higher cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales, most notably from foreign currency hedge losses, and a reduction in U.S. consignment inventory that was achieved through new inventory management strategies. Cash flows used in investing activities were $624.4 million in 2011, compared to $726.9 million in 2010. Additions to instruments decreased in 2011 compared to the 2010 period because the 2010 period included investments in new product launches, such as our Continuum Acetabular System, and included instrumentation in our knee product category, such as posterior referencing instrumentation. Spending on other property, plant and equipment increased in 2011 compared to the 2010 period as there were no significant infrastructure initiatives in 2010. During 2012, for both instruments and property, plant and equipment, we expect to purchase approximately $120 to $140 million. We feel this level of capital spending is necessary to support new product related investments and replacement of older machinery and equipment. Beginning in 2009 and with more significance thereafter, we began investing some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated debt securities. The purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. Acquired intellectual property rights relate to lump sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under the terms of existing contractual arrangements. In the past three years, we have made various business acquisitions including ExtraOrtho, Inc., Beijing Montagne Medical Device Co., Ltd., Sodem Diffusion S.A. and certain foreign based distributors. Cash flows used in financing activities were $455.8 million for 2011, compared to $489.6 million in 2010. In 2011 and 2009, we issued senior unsecured notes in public offerings. We used some of the proceeds to repurchase our common stock and to repay outstanding debt on our revolving credit facilities. In December 2011, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.18 per share to be paid in April 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 30, 2012. Based upon shares outstanding as of December 31, 2011, we would pay $32.1 million. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however future dividends are subject to approval of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. We have four tranches of senior notes outstanding: $250 million aggregate principal amount of 1.4 percent notes due November 30, 2014, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent notes due November 30, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent notes due November 30, 2021 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent notes due November 30, 2039. Interest on each series is payable on May 30 and November 30 of each year until maturity. 28 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT We may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2014 notes, 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes, and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date. We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing November 30, 2012 (Senior Credit Facility). We had $143.0 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2011, and an availability of $1,207.0 million. We intend to secure another senior credit facility in 2012 before our current Senior Credit Facility matures. We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $63.6 million. We place our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We invest only in high quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy. As of December 31, 2011, we had short term and long term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $672.7 million. These investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer. All of these debt securities remain highly rated and therefore we believe the risk of default by the issuers is low. As of December 31, 2011, $1,131.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are held in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. Repatriation of these assets to the U.S. would have negative tax consequences. Approximately $970.0 million of this amount is denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk. The balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate. We may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2011, we had authority to repurchase up to $1.5 billion shares of common stock through December 31, 2014. Management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total 2012 2013 and 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 andThereafter Long term debt $ 1,550.0 $ $ 250.0 $ $ 1,300.0 Interest payments 1,102.8 66.5 131.0 124.0 781.3 Operating leases 179.7 43.5 58.2 36.5 41.5 Purchase obligations 26.1 24.8 1.3 Other long term liabilities 380.7 157.3 141.2 82.2 Total contractual obligations $ 3,239.3 $ 134.8 $ 597.8 $ 301.7 $ 2,205.0 $48.2 million of the other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. Defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. Due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2012. Therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans. Also included in other long term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. Due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. Therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these unrecognized tax benefits. We have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product R&D milestones, sales milestones, or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. Since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. These payments could range from $0 to $72 million. 29 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below. Excess Inventory and Instruments We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. To determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work in process inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis. Income Taxes Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Commitments and Contingencies Accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. In addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $388.2 million related to the Durom Cup, including $162.0 million in 2011. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Durom Cup. Goodwill and Intangible Assets We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined our U.S. Spine reporting units carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches. Fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair value under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the U.S. Spine reporting unit of $204.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. In the year ended December 31, 2009, we also recorded an impairment charge related to this reporting unit of $73.0 million. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges. In our annual impairment testing in 2011, we employed a similar methodology of using income and market approaches to estimate fair value for the U.S. Spine reporting unit. The 2011 impairment test concluded that goodwill was not impaired. However, since goodwill had been written down to its implied fair value of $137.0 million in the prior year, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was only 13 percent greater than its carrying value. Therefore, minor changes to the estimated 30 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT discounted cash flows or market conditions may cause us to recognize further impairment charges in the future. We have six other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit, or by doing a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the prior years income approach. For each of those six reporting units, the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying value. As of December 31, 2011, we had intangible assets of $205.8 million related to trademarks and trade names, of which $192.3 million are classified as having an indefinite life. We currently have and anticipate future product development efforts that may replace the current products that use those trademarks and trade names. While it is anticipated, it is not certain that these new products will utilize these trademarks and trade names. If these new products do not use these trademarks and trade names, these assets may be impaired and or their useful lives may need adjusted. Share based Payment We measure share based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. The expected life of stock options and estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent managements best estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 31 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk MARKET RISK We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. These forward contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees and purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2012 through June 2014. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2011 were $1.3 billion. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2011 were $246.7 million. The weighted average contract rates outstanding at December 31, 2010 were Euro:USD 1.36, Swiss Franc:USD 0.91, USD:Japanese Yen 81.18, British Pound:USD 1.58, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.02, Australian Dollar:USD 0.91, USD:Korean Won 1,159, USD:Swedish Krona 6.89, USD:Czech Koruna 18.32, USD:Thai Baht 31.54, USD:Taiwan Dollar 29.21, USD:South African Rand 8.12, USD:Russian Ruble 32.01 and USD:Indian Ruppee 48.98. We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011 indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through 2013, depending on the direction of the change, by the following average approximate amounts (in millions): Currency AverageAmount Euro $ 53.7 Swiss Franc 23.4 Japanese Yen 33.4 British Pound 11.7 Canadian Dollar 7.6 Australian Dollar 11.4 Korean Won 2.8 Swedish Krona 2.3 Czech Koruna 0.6 Thai Baht 0.8 Taiwan Dollars 1.8 South African Rand 0.4 Russian Rubles 1.1 Indian Rupees 0.9 Any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of $2,404.7 million at December 31, 2011, primarily in Euros and Japanese Yen. $1,314.3 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2011 relates to goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments. 32 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency. As a result, foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. COMMODITY PRICE RISK We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. INTEREST RATE RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities. We invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits. We also have short term and long term investments in highly rated corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, U.S. government treasury funds, municipal bonds, foreign government debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents. Presently, all of our debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility bears interest at short term rates. In 2010, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a consolidated notional amount of $250 million that hedge a portion of our $500 million 4.625 percent Senior Notes due November 30, 2019. On the interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2011, we receive a fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and we pay variable interest equal to the three month LIBOR plus an average of 133 basis points. The interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. The objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents. These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under U.S. GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument. In 2011, we entered into multiple cross currency interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 11,798 million Japanese Yen to hedge U.S. Dollar debt borrowed by our Japan subsidiary. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in interest expense when the hedged item affects net earnings. On the cross currency interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2011, we pay a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent and receive variable interest equal to the three month LIBOR plus 18.5 basis points. The cross currency interest rate swap agreements manage foreign currency exchange risk associated with remeasuring the debt to Japanese Yen and the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate debt. We entered into these instruments in order to take advantage of a market situation where we could lock in interest at a very low, fixed rate on debt. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2011, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on net interest expense. This analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short term and long term investments, derivative instruments, counterparty transactions and accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions or highly rated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties. Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business. Substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the 33 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and healthcare systems. Most notably, in Europe healthcare is sponsored by the government. Because we sell products to public hospitals in those countries, we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints. We continue to monitor the financial crisis in the Euro zone and the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their public hospitals. In countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk, our accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain total $231.1 million, or 28% of our total accounts receivable balance, net, with Italy and Spain accounting for $217.9 million of that amount. We are actively monitoring the situations in these countries and, to the extent the respective governments ability to fund their public hospital programs deteriorates, we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future. While we are exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in Europe and around the world, there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate. 34 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, the companys internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The companys management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The companys independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 35 Table of Contents ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 FORM 10 K ANNUAL REPORT
