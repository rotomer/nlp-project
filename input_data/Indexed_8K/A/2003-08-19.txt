Exhibit 99.1
     On August 18, 2003, Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) reported orders of $1.47 billion and revenue of $1.50 billion for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31, 2003. During the quarter, the company recognized a $1.4 billion non-cash charge required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and reported a GAAP net loss of $1.56 billion, or $3.28 per share.
     "We are encouraged by our third-quarter operating results," said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Orders and revenues came in at expectations, with earnings from operations near the top end of expectations."
     Agilent saw a continued rebound this quarter in semiconductor equipment orders, which reached their highest level in three years. Activity in the company's other segments remained roughly flat compared to the prior year.
     "We made good progress in continuing to reduce our structural costs," Barnholt said. "These costs were reduced by nearly $100 million during the quarter, while worldwide headcount fell by an additional 2,400 during the last three months."
     Continued progress was also reflected on the balance sheet. The company generated $38 million cash from working capital during the quarter despite sequentially higher revenues. Capital spending, at $62 million, remained below depreciation expense of $77 million. Net cash consumption was only $103 million despite $121 million of cash restructuring payments. The company ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents.
 
Segment Results
Test and Measurement (in millions)
     Third-quarter Test and Measurement orders were down 4 percent from one year ago and were off 7 percent from the seasonally strong second quarter. By market segment, communications test orders were down 9 percent from last year largely because of continued weakness in wireline test coupled with a modest decline in wireless test. General purpose test orders were up 8 percent compared to last year because of renewed strength in aerospace and defense markets and rising demand for the new oscilloscope product line. Third-quarter revenues of $613 million were 18 percent above last year, when implementation of a new ERP system interrupted shipments. Sequentially, revenues were down 6 percent.
     The cumulative benefits of aggressive restructuring were clearly evident in the operating results of this segment. The third-quarter operating loss of $69 million was improved by $34 million from three months earlier despite $39 million lower revenues. Compared to last year, the operating loss was reduced by $191 million on $92 million of increased revenues.
Automated Test (in millions)
     The rebound in the Automated Test segment continued in the third quarter, with orders of $251 million up 18 percent from last year to the highest levels since the fourth quarter of 2000. Sequentially, orders were up 15 percent, with both semiconductor test and manufacturing test participating in the increase. Revenues of $206 million were 6 percent above last year and up 35 percent sequentially. Semiconductor Test's third-quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.29 was well ahead of the industry's June reading of 1.19. In the third quarter, this segment returned to profitability, with operating profits of $6 million compared to an operating loss of $5 million one year earlier and a loss of $37 million during the second quarter of this year.
Semiconductor Products (in millions)
     Semiconductor Products' third-quarter orders of $358 million were down 7 percent from last year because of the continued sharp drop in the hardcopy ASIC business. Excluding hardcopy ASICs, segment orders were up 8 percent from one year ago. Total segment orders were off 15 percent from the seasonally strong second quarter. Revenues of $380 million were down 3 percent from last year and up 1 percent sequentially. Excluding the hardcopy ASIC business, revenues were up 10 percent, consistent with the year-to-year increase in worldwide semiconductor industry sales. Segment operating results benefited from better yields on new products, the shutdown of a facility and restructuring actions. The third-quarter segment loss of $8 million represented a $35 million improvement over second-quarter results on essentially flat revenues. Compared to last year, the operating loss was reduced by $30 million despite $10 million lower sales.
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis (millions)
 
     Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis orders and revenues showed some improvement from the generally flat trend of the past several quarters. Third-quarter orders of $293 million were up 8 percent from last year and up 5 percent sequentially. Life Sciences showed the most strength, with orders up 14 percent from last year and 10 percent sequentially while Chemical Analysis orders rose 4 percent from last year and were 1 percent ahead of the second quarter. Revenues of $303 million were 6 percent ahead of one year ago and the second quarter. Segment profits were about equal to one year ago. Compared to the second quarter, when spending is seasonally higher, operating profits were improved by $21 million on $17 million higher revenues.
Note on Non-Cash Charge Related to SFAS 109
     In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," Agilent recorded a non-cash charge of $1.4 billion to establish a valuation allowance, which essentially eliminates its net deferred tax assets. This adjustment will impact both GAAP tax expense and shareholders' equity on Agilent's financial statements, but has no impact on the company's cash flow, liquidity or future prospects.
     In large part because of Agilent's cumulative losses over the past few years in the United States and the United Kingdom, SFAS No. 109 requires that "greater weight be given to previous cumulative losses than the outlook for future profitability when determining whether deferred tax assets can be used." In essence, the company is now unable to reference forecasts of future operating profits to value its deferred tax assets for GAAP purposes.
     This valuation allowance will be reviewed periodically and could be reversed, partially or totally, when business results have sufficiently improved to support recognition of the deferred tax assets for GAAP purposes.
