On November 17, 2003, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") announced its results for the three and twelve months ended October 31, 2003. Information regarding such results and a copy of the financial statements of the Company for the three and twelve months ended October 31, 2003 is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
 
On November 17, 2003, Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) reported orders of $1.73 billion and revenue of $1.68 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, 2003. During the quarter, the company reported GAAP net earnings of $13 million, or $0.03 per diluted share. This compares to a GAAP loss of $236 million, or $0.51 per share, in last year's fourth quarter.
 
"We had a very good finish to a very tough year," said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Orders, revenues and earnings all came in above expectations."
 
The company ended the quarter with about $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, up $177 million from the prior quarter. In the fourth quarter, inventories improved to below 100 days on hand for the first time in Agilent's history. Capital spending of $57 million was $21 million below the level of depreciation.
 
During the fourth quarter, Agilent saw evidence of stronger economic activity reflected in several of its markets. Semiconductor Products orders were up 36 percent from one year ago to the highest level since early 2001. Automated Test segment orders were higher for the third consecutive quarter, reaching the highest level in three years. Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis orders were at record levels, 8 percent ahead of one year earlier. Activity in the Test and Measurement segment was somewhat weaker than the prior year because of continued softness in wireline telecom markets. Overall, the company's book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 compared to 0.98 in the prior quarter and 0.86 one year ago.
 
About 40 percent of Agilent's revenues today are tied to consumer electronics.
Segment Results
 
Test and Measurement
(in millions)
 
 
 
Fourth-quarter Test and Measurement orders were 4 percent below one year ago and up 14 percent from the seasonally weak third quarter. By market segment, communications test orders were about flat from last year with continued weakness in wireline test offsetting a modest rise in wireless test. General purpose test orders were off about 6 percent from one year ago because of relative weakness in services and support. Revenues of $631 million were 16 percent below last year.
 
Aggressive restructuring continued to improve the operating performance of this segment. The fourth-quarter operating loss of $11 million was $96 million better than one year ago despite $116 million lower revenues. Compared to the third quarter, profits were improved by $58 million on only $18 million higher revenues.
 
Automated Test
(in millions)
 
 
The Automated Test segment had another strong performance in the fourth quarter, with orders of $260 million up 72 percent from last year to the highest levels since the fourth quarter of 2000. Sequentially, orders were up 4 percent from already strong third quarter levels, with both semiconductor test and manufacturing test participating in the increase for the third consecutive quarter. Revenues of $260 million were 18 percent above last year and up 26 percent sequentially. Operating profits of $45 million, or 17 percent of revenues, compared to profits of $9 million one year ago and $6 million in the prior quarter.
 
Semiconductor Products
(in millions)
 
 
Semiconductor Products saw an unexpected fourth-quarter surge in demand, with orders reaching $493 million, 36 percent above last year to the highest levels since early 2001. Sequentially, orders were up 38 percent. The strength was almost across the board, with personal systems orders up 35 percent from last year and networking systems up 37 percent. Fourth-quarter revenues of $463 million were down 2 percent from last year because of a sharp drop in the hardcopy ASIC business. Semiconductor Products' book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 compares to 0.77 last year and 0.94 in the third quarter.
 
Segment operating performance continued to reflect the benefits of restructuring actions, better yields on new products and higher volumes. Operating profits in the quarter reached $40 million, essentially double last year on $8 million lower volume. Sequentially, profits were up $48 million on $83 million higher volume.
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis
(in millions)
 
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis orders and revenues were at record levels in the fourth quarter, showing the second consecutive quarterly improvement after several quarters of relatively flat activity. Fourth-quarter orders of $333 million were up 8 percent from one year ago and up 14 percent sequentially. Revenues of $321 million were also 8 percent ahead of one year ago and 6 percent ahead of the third quarter. Segment profits of $53 million were also at record levels, $10 million above last year on $23 million higher volume and $12 million above the third quarter on $18 million higher volume.
