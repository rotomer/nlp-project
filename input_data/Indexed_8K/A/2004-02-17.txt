PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 17, 2004  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.73 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2004, 27 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.64 billion, 16 percent ahead of last year. First quarter GAAP net earnings of $71 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $369 million, or $0.78 per share, in last year's first quarter.
 
Excluding $32 million of net restructuring and amortization charges, Agilent reported first quarter operating net income of $103 million, or $0.21 per share, versus a loss on a comparable basis of $109 million, or $0.23 per share, one year ago.
 
"We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter of this year," said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Stronger economic activity in most of our markets drove these results, coupled with our ability to achieve lower structural costs sooner than anticipated."
 
"During the quarter, we achieved a $1.40 billion operating breakeven cost structure, three quarters earlier than planned
(1)
. For the second consecutive quarter, Agilent generated positive free cash flow from operations,
(2)
" said Barnholt. The company ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash and equivalents, up $71 million from the prior quarter. Inventory days-on-hand improved by 15 from one year ago to 107. Capital spending of $29 million was $40 million below the level of depreciation.
 
During the first quarter, Semiconductor Products orders were up 53 percent from last year to the highest levels since the year 2000. Automated Test segment orders, while down from the seasonally strong fourth quarter, were up 74 percent from last year. Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis orders were 15 percent above one year ago, while Test and Measurement segment orders were up 8 percent. Overall, the company's book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 in the first quarter, compared to 1.03 in the fourth quarter of last year and 0.96 one year ago.
 
Looking ahead, Barnholt said, "The markets we serve are clearly gaining some traction, and Agilent has both the cost structure and the innovative new products to take full advantage of the recovery. Without the normal first quarter drop, we are somewhat cautious about assuming the usual seasonal rise in second quarter activity."
 
"We are maintaining our prior second quarter guidance of earnings before restructuring and amortization charges in the range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share
(3)
on revenues of $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion. For the year 2004, we are comfortable with the current range of analyst expectations for both revenues and operating EPS," said Barnholt.
Segment Results
 
 
Test and Measurement
(in millions)
 
 
Test and Measurement returned to profitability in the first quarter as a result of aggressive restructuring. Orders during the quarter of $642 million were 8 percent above one year ago and flat versus the seasonally strong fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Compared to last year, orders were stronger in both communications, driven by demand for wireless handset testers, and in general purpose test, where orders were up 13 percent. Revenues of $642 million were 1 percent above last year and 2 percent ahead of three months earlier.
 
First quarter operating profits of $4 million were improved by $136 million compared to one year ago, despite only $9 million higher revenues. Profits were up $15 million versus the fourth quarter on a revenue gain of $11 million.

First quarter Automated Test orders of $200 million were 74 percent above one year ago, with significant year-to-year growth in all product lines.

Segment profits were positive for the third consecutive quarter. First quarter profits of $20 million were up $68 million from one year ago on an $83 million increase in revenues.
