Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The information in this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto is furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
On May 17, 2004, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") issued its press release announcing financial results for the three months ended April 30, 2004. A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future. We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation. Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release. This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the company's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the company. The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

PALO ALTO, Calif., May 17, 2004  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.89 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2004, 24 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.83 billion, 25 percent ahead of last year. Second quarter GAAP net earnings were $104 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $146 million, or $0.31 per share, in last year's second quarter.
 
Excluding $15 million of net restructuring and amortization charges, Agilent reported second quarter operating net income of $119 million, or $0.24 per share, versus a loss on a comparable basis of $72 million, or $0.15 per share, one year ago.
 
"Agilent's businesses are clearly picking up, with virtually all of our major markets and all geographies gaining momentum," said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Orders and revenue were at their highest levels since early 2001. Operating earnings per share
(1)
of 24 cents were near the top end of our guidance range  three cents better than the first quarter and 39 cents above last year."
 
For the third consecutive quarter, Agilent generated positive free cash flow from operations
(2)
. The company ended the quarter with $1.84 billion of cash and equivalents, up $164 million from the prior quarter. Inventory days-on-hand improved by 21 from one year ago to 94. Receivables days sales outstanding improved by 3 from one year ago to 54. Capital spending of $35 million was $32 million below the level of depreciation.
 
"Given our strong orders and revenues, our performance on the bottom line could have been even better," said Barnholt. "With our markets clearly on the upswing, our market shares stable or rising, and our fundamental cost structure firmly in place, Agilent's remaining challenge is to demonstrate superior performance on the bottom line. We intend to make significant progress against that commitment during the second half of this year."
 
For the seasonally soft third quarter, Agilent expects revenues of $1.80 billion to $1.90 billion, roughly in line with second quarter results. Operating earnings should be in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 per share
(3)
compared to the second quarter's $0.24. During the fourth quarter, the company currently anticipates revenues to be roughly $50 million above the third quarter and operating earnings per share to be up an additional $0.05.
Segment Results
 
Test and Measurement
(in millions)
 
 
Second quarter Test and Measurement orders of $745 million were 23 percent above one year ago and up 16 percent from the seasonally soft first quarter. Compared to last year, orders were up in all geographies and all markets except wireline telecommunications. Revenues of $705 million were 8 percent above last year and 10 percent ahead of three months earlier.
 
Second quarter operating profits of $11 million were improved by $114 million compared to one year ago on a $53 million increase in revenues because of the cumulative benefits of aggressive restructuring. Profits were up $7 million versus the first quarter on a revenue gain of $63 million because of disappointing results in systems and support businesses. Actions now under way to address these performance issues are expected to enable segment operating margins to reach double-digit levels by the fourth quarter of this year.
 
Automated Test
(in millions)
 
 
Second quarter Automated Test orders of $286 million were 31 percent above one year ago and at the highest level since 2000, with significant year-to-year growth in all product lines. Sequentially, orders were up 43 percent from the seasonally weak first quarter. Revenues of $266 million were 74 percent above last year and up 21 percent from the first quarter. The segment book-to-bill was 1.08 compared to 1.43 one year ago and 0.91 in the first quarter.
 
Segment profits of $34 million were up $71 million from one year ago on a $113 million increase in revenues, an attractive 63 percent incremental performance. Return on invested capital (ROIC) during the quarter was about 16 percent

Semiconductor Products
(in millions)
 
 
The top line of Semiconductor Products was very strong again in the second quarter. Orders of $523 million were up 25 percent from last year, with Personal Systems orders up 35 percent while Networking Systems orders were about flat with last year's levels. Second quarter revenues of $527 million were 40 percent above one year ago compared to a 32 percent increase in worldwide semiconductor industry shipments through March.
 
Segment profits of $65 million were $108 million better than last year on a $151 million increase in sales. Sequentially, profits improved $5 million on a $58 million increase in revenues as the business invested to meet strong demand for new mobile and consumer products and experienced cost pressures in Networking Systems. Nonetheless, the segment generated a very attractive 34 percent ROIC during the quarter
(5)
.

(in millions)

Segment profits reached $39 million in the quarter, up $19 million from one year ago on a $47 million increase in revenues. Profits were off $10 million from the first quarter because of the normal seasonal increase in expenses. During the quarter, the segment achieved an ROIC of 21 percent
