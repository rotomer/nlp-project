PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 14, 2005  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.61 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2005, 7 percent below one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.66 billion, 1 percent ahead of last year. First quarter GAAP net earnings were $103 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $71 million, or $0.14 per share, in last year's first quarter.
 
Excluding a net $3 million of restructuring charges and tax benefits, Agilent reported first quarter operating net income of $100 million, or $0.20 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $103 million, or $0.21 per share, one year ago.

"I am pleased with Agilent's first quarter performance," said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We executed well, with very good operating discipline and cash generation in a challenging market environment. This quarter we continued to build on our strong foundation of product innovation and operational excellence that I believe will benefit Agilent for years to come."
 
The company reported first quarter revenues of $1.66 billion, consistent with its expectations of $1.60 billion to $1.70 billion. Operating earnings, at $0.20 per share, were at the top of the guidance range of $0.14 to $0.21 per share. Gross margins were essentially flat compared with last year, despite much more difficult conditions in Agilent's semiconductor-related businesses, and operating expenses remained under very good control. The company generated another $100 million in free cash flow
(2)
from operations during the quarter, bringing total cash on hand to $2.5 billion."
 
Looking ahead, Agilent said it expects relatively flat second quarter fiscal 2005 revenues of $1.60 billion to $1.70 billion, reflecting the $70 million lower revenues associated with the divestiture of the company's camera module business. Operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.23 per share

Segment Results
 
Test and Measurement
(in millions)
 
 
First quarter Test and Measurement orders of $652 million were 3 percent above one year ago and down 5 percent from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Overall segment demand was characterized by continued softness in wireless handset manufacturing test, stabilizing wireline test markets, and generally flat general purpose test orders. Revenues of $700 million were 10 percent above last year and down 10 percent from three months earlier due to continued softness in wireless handset manufacturing test.
First quarter operating profits of $63 million were improved by $58 million compared with one year ago on a $63 million increase in revenues. Compared with the fourth quarter, segment profits were down $54 million on an $82 million drop in revenues. During the quarter, Test and Measurement achieved a 12 percent Return On Invested Capital
(5)
(ROIC), up from 2 percent last year but down from 19 percent in last year's fourth quarter.
 
Automated Test
(in millions)
 
 
First quarter Automated Test orders of $160 million were down 20 percent from one year ago but up 17 percent sequentially. Compared with last year, all product lines were weaker except parametric test; sequentially, all product lines were up except manufacturing test. Utilization rates for SOC testers at semiconductor contract manufacturers (SCMs) improved for the second consecutive quarter, and averaged about 92 percent during the quarter. While the rebound is expected to be very slow because of excess overall industry capacity, last year's fourth quarter may prove to be the bottom for Automated Test orders. Revenues of $155 million were 29 percent below last year and down 21 percent sequentially. Automated Test's book-to-bill ratio rose to 1.03 in the quarter from 0.91 last year and 0.70 one quarter earlier.
 
The segment had an operating loss of $34 million during the quarter compared with profits of $21 million one year ago on $64 million lower revenues. Sequentially, profits were down $28 million on a $41 million reduction in revenues. During the quarter, gross margins were depressed by lower volumes and intense competitive pressures. Operating expenses were relatively flat year-to-year. Acceptance of the company's new generation of flash memory and SOC test systems has been encouraging, with 90 percent of flash memory test and 16 percent of SOC orders now coming from new products.
 
Semiconductor Products
(in millions)
 
 
Semiconductor Products orders were $435 million during the first quarter, down 26 percent from one year ago but up 7 percent sequentially. Compared with last year, orders declined virtually across the board. Personal systems components orders were off 30 percent from last year, with particular weakness in optical mice; networking systems components were down 16 percent from last year. Sequentially, personal systems components were up 6 percent and networking systems components were up 7 percent. First quarter revenues of $450 million were 5 percent below last year and down 9 percent sequentially. The book-to-bill for Semiconductor Products improved to 0.97 in the first quarter compared with 0.83 three months ago but remained well below last year's 1.24.
 
Segment profits of $27 million were $33 million below last year on a $24 million drop in revenues; margins suffered as the industry moved from shortage to surplus. Sequentially, profits were $19 million higher despite $42 million lower revenues as both camera modules and fiber optics showed significant improvements in quality, yield and cost compared with the second half of last year. Segment ROIC
(5)
was 10 percent during the quarter compared with 23 percent one year ago and 6 percent during the fourth quarter.
 
On Feb. 3, 2005, the company announced it had completed the sale of its camera module business to Flextronics.
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis
(in millions)
 
Good momentum in Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis continued in this year's first quarter. Orders of $356 million were 16 percent above last year, with Life Sciences orders up 18 percent and Chemical Analysis up 15 percent. During the quarter, the segment saw particular strength from generic drug manufacturers, and strong demand from petrochemical and environmental industries. Revenues of $354 million were 13 percent above last year and up 1 percent sequentially.
 
Segment profits of $51 million were $4 million above last year on a $41 million increase in revenues as the segment continued to ramp its investments in Life Sciences. Sustained profits and excellent capital management enabled the segment to achieve an ROIC
(5)
of 29 percent during the quarter compared with last year's ROIC of 23 percent and 24 percent in the fourth quarter.
