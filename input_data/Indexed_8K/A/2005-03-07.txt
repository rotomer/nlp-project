Agilent Technologies, Inc. Performance-Based Compensation Plan for Covered Employees
 
On March 1, 2005, the shareholders of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the "Company" or "Agilent") approved the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Performance-Based Compensation Plan for Covered Employees, Amended and Restated Effective November 1, 2004 (the "Performance-Based Compensation Plan").
 
Employees of Agilent and its affiliates who are, or are reasonably expected to be, "covered officers" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code during the fiscal year, are eligible to be designated by the Compensation Committee as a participant for that year. The Performance-Based Compensation Plan is administered in six-month performance periods that coincide with each half of Agilent's fiscal year. The target bonus, which is paid if 100% of all applicable performance measures are met in the performance period, is equal to a fixed percentage of the participant's base salary.
 
At the beginning of each performance period, the Compensation Committee determines the applicable performance measures, which can be based on net order dollars, net profit growth, net revenue dollars, revenue growth, individual performance, earnings per share, return on assets, return on equity, return on invested capital, other company-wide and business unit financial objectives, customer satisfaction indicators and operational efficiency measures. The Compensation Committee also determines the threshold bonus percentage, the target bonus and the maximum bonus, and the percentages to be allocated for each performance measure.
 
Following the end of each performance period, the Compensation Committee determines the actual performance results for each performance measure and the amount of the bonus to which each plan participant is entitled. If the relevant performance measures are not achieved, the plan participant may not receive any bonus or only a portion of the target bonus. If the relevant performance measures are exceeded, the plan participant may receive a bonus in excess of the target bonus. The foregoing summary of the Performance-Based Compensation Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10.3
 
CONFIDENTIAL
 
 
This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the "") is entered into this 1st day of March, 2005 (the "Effective Date") between William P. Sullivan ("Executive") and Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""). This Agreement is intended to provide Executive with the compensation and benefits described herein upon the occurrence of specific events following a change of control of the ownership of the Company (defined as "Change of Control").
Agreement
Company
 
 
As is the case with most, if not all, publicly traded businesses, it is expected that the Company from time to time may consider or may be presented with the need to consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change in control of the ownership of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that such considerations can be a distraction to Executive and can cause the Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities or to be influenced by the impact of a possible change in control of the ownership of the Company on Executive's personal circumstances in evaluating such possibilities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company.
A.
 
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide Executive with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate Executive to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its shareholders.
B.
 
The Board believes that it is important to provide Executive with certain benefits upon Executive's termination of employment in certain instances upon or following a Change of Control that provide Executive with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to Executive to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.
C.
 
At the same time, the Board expects the Company to receive certain benefits in exchange for providing Executive with this measure of financial security and incentive under the Agreement. Therefore, the Board believes that the Executive should provide various specific commitments which are intended to assure the Company that Executive will not direct Executive's skills, experience and knowledge to the detriment of the Company for a period not to exceed the period during which payments are being made to Executive under this Agreement.
D.
 
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Article VII.
E.
 
The Company and Executive hereby agree as follows:
 
 
 
Executive is currently employed as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
1.1
 
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect commencing on the Effective Date so long as Executive is employed by Company; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of the parties hereto contained in Articles III through VIII shall survive any termination for the longer of (i) thirty-six (36) months following a Termination Event (as hereinafter defined) (the "Term") or (ii) such longer period provided for in this Agreement.
1.2
 
The Company and Executive each agree and acknowledge that Executive is employed by the Company as an "at-will" employee and that either Executive or the Company has the right at any time to terminate Executive's employment with the Company, with or without cause or advance notice, for any reason or for no reason. The Company and Executive wish to set forth the compensation and benefits which Executive shall be entitled to receive in the event that Executive's employment with the Company terminates under the circumstances described in Article II of this Agreement.
1.3
 
The duties and obligations of the Company to Executive under this Agreement shall be in consideration for Executive's past services to the Company, Executive's continued employment with the Company, Executive's compliance with the obligations described in Section 4.2, and Executive's execution of the general waiver and release described in Section 4.3. The Company and Executive agree that Executive's compliance with the obligations described in Section 4.2 and Executive's execution of the general waiver and release described in Section 4.3 are preconditions to Executive's entitlement to the receipt of benefits under this Agreement and that these benefits shall not be earned unless all such conditions have been satisfied through the scheduled date of payment. The Company hereby declares that it has relied upon Executive's commitments under this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Article IV, and would not have been induced to enter into this Agreement or to execute this Agreement in the absence of such commitments.
1.4
 
 
 
2.1 Involuntary Termination Upon or Following Change of Control.
 
(a) In the event Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated at any time by the Company without Cause either at the time of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, such termination of employment will be a Termination Event and the Company shall pay Executive the compensation and benefits described in Article III.
 
(b) In the event Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries is either involuntarily terminated by the Company with Cause at any time, or is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause at any time other than either at the time

In the event Executive voluntarily terminates his employment within three (3) months of the occurrence of an event constituting Good Reason and on account of an event constituting Good Reason, which event occurs either at the time of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, then such termination of employment will be a Termination Event and the Company shall pay Executive the compensation and benefits described in Article III.
 
(b) In the event (i) Executive voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason other than on account of an event constituting Good Reason under the circumstances described in Section 2.2(a), or (ii) Executive's employment terminates on account of either death or physical or mental disability, then such termination of employment will be a Termination Event, Executive will be entitled to receive any payments or benefits under the provisions of this Agreement, and the Company will cease paying compensation or providing benefits to Executive as of the Executive's termination date.

3.1
Right to Benefits
 
. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive shall receive three times the sum of Executive's Base Salary and Target Bonus, less any applicable withholding of federal, state or local taxes. Such salary and bonus continuation shall be paid in equal semi-annual installments over the three year period following the date of the Termination Event.
3.2
Salary Continuation
 
. Following the occurrence of a Termination Event, to the extent permitted by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and by the Company's group health insurance policies, Executive and his covered dependents will be eligible to continue their health insurance benefits at their own expense. If Executive elects COBRA continuation, the Company shall pay Executive and his covered dependents' COBRA continuation premiums for twelve (12) months following the date of the Termination Event, provided that the Company's obligation to make such payments shall cease immediately to the extent that Executive and/or his covered dependents are no longer entitled to
3.3
Health Insurance Coverage
 
receive COBRA continuation coverage. Executive agrees to notify a duly authorized officer of the Company, in writing, immediately upon Executive or a covered dependent beginning to receive health benefits from another source, or as otherwise required by COBRA.
 
This Section 3.3 provides only for the Company's payment of COBRA continuation premiums for the periods specified above. This Section 3.3 does not affect the rights of Executive or Executive's covered dependents under any applicable law with respect to health insurance continuation coverage.
 
. Executive's stock options which are outstanding as of the date of the Termination Event (the "Stock Options") shall become fully vested upon the occurrence of the Termination Event and exercisable so long as Executive complies with the restrictions and limitations set forth in Article IV. The maximum period of time during which the Stock Options shall remain exercisable, and all other terms and conditions of the Stock Options, shall be as specified in the relevant Stock Option agreements and relevant stock plans under which the Stock Option were granted. The term "Stock Options" shall not include any rights of the Executive under the Company's employee stock purchase plan.
3.4
Stock Award Acceleration
 
Executive's restricted stock awards that are outstanding as of the date of the Termination Event ("Restricted Stock") shall become fully vested and free from any contractual rights of the Company to repurchase or otherwise reacquire the Restricted Stock as a result of Executive's termination of employment. All shares of Restricted Stock which have not yet been delivered to Executive or his designee (whether because subject to joint escrow instructions or otherwise) shall be promptly delivered to Executive or his designee upon the occurrence of a Termination Event.
 
3.5 Long Term Performance.
 
(a) In the event of a Change of Control, Executive shall be guaranteed to receive an amount for any Performance Period under the LTPP (as defined below) equal to the greater of (i) the Target Award (as defined in the LTPP) for such Performance Period or (ii) the accrued amount of the payout (i.e. the amount accrued as the expected liability for the LTPP by the Company's corporate finance department) as of the date of the closing of the Change of Control for such Performance Period, both as prorated on the basis of the percentage of time from the commencement of such Performance Period to the date of the closing of the Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company amends or modifies the LTPP after the closing of a Change of Control and Executive would receive a larger amount under such revised LTPP, Executive shall receive such amount in lieu of any amounts to be paid under this Section 3.5. Any payment for any Performance Period under the LTPP shall be made at the earliest of the end of such Performance Period, the termination date of the LTPP or the date of a Termination Event. For purposes of this Section 3.5, "LTPP" shall mean the Long-term Performance Program Description for Section 16 Officers, effective November 1, 2003, as it may be amended from time to time and as in effect as of the date of the closing of the Change of Control, without giving effect to any terminations, amendments or modifications occurring thereafter.
 
(b) Executive's rights to the payment provided in this Section 3.5 shall not be terminated by the application of Section 4.2 of this Agreement.
 
If a Termination Event occurs, Executive shall receive a bonus for the performance period in which the Termination Event occurs. The amount of the bonus shall be equal to the amount of the bonus the Executive would have been paid had the Executive continued his employment with the Company until the end of such performance period multiplied by a fraction in which (i) the numerator is the number of days from and including the first day of the performance period until and including the date of the Termination Event, and (ii) the denominator is the number of days in the performance period. Such bonus shall be paid on the date Executive would have received the bonus if the Termination Event had not occurred during such performance period. Executive's rights to the payment provided in this Section 3.6 shall not be terminated by the application of Section 4.2 of this Agreement.
3.6
Bonus.
 
. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, Executive shall not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits after the date of the Termination Event, or otherwise.
3.7
Mitigation
 
 
 
. The benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of any benefit provided under any other severance plan, program or arrangement of the Company in effect at the time of a Termination Event. The Company shall withhold appropriate federal, state or local income, employment and other applicable taxes from any payments hereunder.
4.1
Reduction in Payments and Benefits; Withholding Taxes
 
4.2 Obligations of the Executive.
 
(a) For two years following the Termination Event, Executive agrees not to personally solicit any of the employees either of the Company or of any entity in which the Company directly or indirectly possesses the ability to determine the voting of 50% or more of the voting securities of such entity (including two-party joint ventures in which each party possesses 50% of the total voting power of the entity) to become employed elsewhere or provide the names of such employees to any other company which Executive has reason to believe will solicit such employees.
 
(b) Following the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive agrees to continue to satisfy his obligations under the terms of the Company's standard form of Proprietary Information and Non-Disclosure Agreement previously executed by Executive (or any comparable agreement subsequently executed by Executive in substitution or supplement thereto). Executive's obligations under this Section 4.2(b) shall not be limited to the Term.
 
(c) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and accordingly agrees that for one year following the Termination Event, Executive will not, whether on Executive's own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person, company, business entity or other organization
 
whatsoever, directly or indirectly, either (i) engage in any business which is a Competitive Business, or (ii) enter the employ of, or render any services to, any person or entity (or any division of any person or entity) which engages in a Competitive Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Competitive Business" shall include any person or entity that competes with any business of the Company or its affiliates at the time of the Termination Event (including, without limitation, businesses which the Company or its affiliates have specific plans at the time of the Termination Event to conduct in the future and as to which plans Executive is aware at that time) in any geographical area where the Company or its affiliates manufacture, sell, lease, rent, license, or otherwise provide their products or services (including, without limitation, geographical areas where the Company or its affiliates have specific plans at the time of the Termination Event to engage in one or more such activities and as to which plans Executive is aware at that time). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a person or entity shall be treated as a Competitive Business for purposes of this Agreement if the Company includes such person or entity (which, unless otherwise specified by the Company, shall be considered to include all of the subsidiaries and other affiliates of such listed person or entity) on a list to be prepared by the Company at or shortly after the time of the Termination Event, the list is provided to the Executive, and the Company's list shall include no more than 15 persons and entities.
only
 
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a violation of this Section 4.2(c) if any one or more of the following shall occur:
 
(1) Executive may own, directly or indirectly, solely as a passive investment, securities of any person engaged in a Competitive Business, which securities are publicly traded on a national or regional stock exchange or on the over-the-counter market if Executive (A) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such person, and (B) does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such person.
 
(2) If Executive is providing services to or for the benefit of an entity which has portions of its business which constitute a Competitive Business and portions of which do not constitute a Competitive Business, Executive may provide services to such entity so long as Executive does not provide services, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of such Competitive Business.
 
(3) If Executive is providing services to or for the benefit of an entity which does not engage in a Competitive Business, and such entity subsequently is acquired by a person or entity which does engage in a Competitive Business, Executive may continue such employment so long as Executive does not personally engage, directly or indirectly, in such Competitive Business or otherwise advise or assist such Competitive Business.
 
(d) It is expressly understood and agreed that although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Section 4 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against Executive, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void, but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time or territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
 
(e) Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 4.2(a), Section 4.2(b), or Section 4.2(c) would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to cease making any payments or providing any benefit otherwise required by this Agreement and, with respect to a breach or threatened breach of Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.2(b) only, obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction, or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
 
. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, and prior to the receipt of any benefits under this Agreement on account of the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive shall, as of the date of a Termination Event, execute an employee release substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A as shall be determined by the Company. Such employee release shall specifically relate to all of Executive's rights and claims in existence at the time of such execution relating to Executive's employment with the Company, but shall not include (i) Executive's rights under this Agreement; (ii) Executive's rights under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company; or (iii) Executive's rights to indemnification under the Company's bylaws or other governing instruments or under any agreement addressing such subject matter between Executive and the Company. It is understood that Executive has twenty-one (21) days to consider whether to execute such employee release and Executive may revoke such employee release within seven (7) business days after execution of such employee release. In the event Executive does not execute such employee release within the twenty-one (21) day period, or if Executive revokes such employee release within the seven (7) business day period, no benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and this Agreement shall be null and void. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the scope or time of applicability of such employee release once it is executed and not timely revoked.
4.3
Employee Release Prior to Receipt of Benefits
 
. In the event that any payment received or to be received by Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 4.4 ("Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any comparable federal, state, local or foreign excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, is hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment from the Company ("Gross-Up Payment") in such an amount that after the payment of all taxes (including, without limitation, any interest and penalties on such taxes and the Excise Tax) on the Payment and on the Gross-Up Payment, Executive shall retain an amount equal to the Payment minus all applicable taxes on the Payment (excluding the Excise Tax). The intent of the parties is that the Company shall be solely responsible for, and shall pay, any Excise Tax on the Payment and Gross-Up Payment and any income, employment and other taxes (including, without limitation, penalties and interest) imposed on any Gross-Up Payment (as well as any loss of tax deduction caused by the Payment or the Gross-Up Payment).

The Company and Executive shall furnish to Independent Tax Counsel such information and documents as Independent Tax Counsel may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 4.4. The Company shall bear all costs that Independent Tax Counsel may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 4.4.
