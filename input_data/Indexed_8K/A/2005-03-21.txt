Exhibit 10.1
 
Summary of Compensation Arrangement Between Agilent and Edward W. Barnholt
 
Edward W. Barnholt is Chairman Emeritus of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the "Company"). On March 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of the Company approved the following compensation arrangement for Mr. Barnholt to continue through the end of the fiscal year, October 31, 2005. This arrangement represents the same compensation he had been receiving since the beginning of the fiscal year: 1) an annual base salary of $1,000,000; 2) a short-term target bonus of 130 percent of base salary; and 3) payment of the full value of any long-term performance program awards for the three-year performance periods that commenced November 1, 2003 and November 1, 2004, to be paid after the end of the applicable performance period to the extent that the performance goals are achieved.
 

Exhibit 10.2
 
CONFIDENTIAL
 
 
This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the "") is entered into as of the 1st day of March, 2005 (the "Effective Date") between Edward W. Barnholt ("Executive") and Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), and shall supersede in its entirety the prior Change of Control Severance Agreement between Executive and the Company dated November 27, 2002, and amended as of April 2, 2004. This Agreement is intended to provide Executive with the compensation and benefits described herein upon the occurrence of specific events following a change of control of the ownership of the Company (defined as "Change of Control").
Agreement
Company
 
 
As is the case with most, if not all, publicly traded businesses, it is expected that the Company from time to time may consider or may be presented with the need to consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change in control of the ownership of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that such considerations can be a distraction to Executive and can cause the Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities or to be influenced by the impact of a possible change in control of the ownership of the Company on Executive's personal circumstances in evaluating such possibilities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company.
A.
 
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide Executive with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate Executive to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its shareholders.
B.
 
The Board believes that it is important to provide Executive with certain benefits upon Executive's termination of employment in certain instances upon or following a Change of Control that provide Executive with financial security and incentive and encouragement to Executive to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.
C.
 
At the same time, the Board expects the Company to receive certain benefits in exchange for providing Executive with this measure of financial security and incentive under the Agreement. Therefore, the Board believes that the Executive should provide various specific commitments which are intended to assure the Company that Executive will not direct Executive's skills, experience and knowledge to the detriment of the Company for a period not to exceed the period during which payments are being made to Executive under this Agreement.
D.
 
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Article VII.
E.
 
The Company and Executive hereby agree as follows:
 
 
 
Executive is currently Chairman Emeritus of the Company and shall retire from employment with the Company no later than October 31, 2005.
1.1
 
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect commencing on the Effective Date so long as Executive is employed by Company; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of the parties hereto contained in Articles III through VIII shall survive any termination for the longer of (i) twenty-four (24) months following a Termination Event (as hereinafter defined) (the "Term") or (ii) such longer period provided for in this Agreement.
1.2
 
The Company and Executive each agree and acknowledge that Executive is employed by the Company as an "at-will" employee and that either Executive or the Company has the right at any time to terminate Executive's employment with the Company, with or without cause or advance notice, for any reason or for no reason. The Company and Executive wish to set forth the compensation and benefits which Executive shall be entitled to receive in the event that Executive's employment with the Company terminates under the circumstances described in Article II of this Agreement.
1.3
 
The duties and obligations of the Company to Executive under this Agreement shall be in consideration for Executive's past services to the Company, Executive's continued employment with the Company, Executive's compliance with the obligations described in Section 4.2, and Executive's execution of the general waiver and release described in Section 4.3. The Company and Executive agree that Executive's compliance with the obligations described in Section 4.2 and Executive's execution of the general waiver and release described in Section 4.3 are preconditions to Executive's entitlement to the receipt of benefits under this Agreement and that these benefits shall not be earned unless all such conditions have been satisfied through the scheduled date of payment. The Company hereby declares that it has relied upon Executive's commitments under this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Article IV, and would not have been induced to enter into this Agreement or to execute this Agreement in the absence of such commitments.
1.4
 
 
 
2.1 Involuntary Termination Upon or Following Change of Control.
 
(a) In the event Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated at any time by the Company without Cause either at the time of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, such termination of employment will be a Termination Event and the Company shall pay Executive the compensation and benefits described in Article III.
 
(b) In the event Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries is either involuntarily terminated by the Company with Cause at any time, or is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause at any time other than either at the time
 
of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, then such termination of employment will be a Termination Event, Executive will be entitled to receive any payments or benefits under the provisions of this Agreement, and the Company will cease paying compensation or providing benefits to Executive as of Executive's termination date.
not

2.2 Voluntary Termination Upon or Following Change of Control.
 
(a) Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment with the Company and its subsidiaries at any time. In the event Executive voluntarily terminates his employment within three (3) months of the occurrence of an event constituting Good Reason and on account of an event constituting Good Reason, which event occurs either at the time of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, then such termination of employment will be a Termination Event and the Company shall pay Executive the compensation and benefits described in Article III.
 
(b) In the event (i) Executive voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason other than on account of an event constituting Good Reason under the circumstances described in Section 2.2(a), or (ii) Executive's employment terminates on account of either death or physical or mental disability, then such termination of employment will be a Termination Event, Executive will be entitled to receive any payments or benefits under the provisions of this Agreement, and the Company will cease paying compensation or providing benefits to Executive as of the Executive's termination date.
not
not
 
 
 
. If a Termination Event occurs, Executive shall be entitled to receive the benefits described in this Agreement so long as Executive complies with the restrictions and limitations set forth in Article IV. If a Termination Event does not occur, Executive shall not be entitled to receive any benefits described in this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically set forth herein.
3.1
Right to Benefits
 
. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive shall receive Executive's Base Salary and Target Bonus through the end of the Company's fiscal year ending October 31, 2005, less any applicable withholding of federal, state or local taxes, and, subject to Section 3.6 below, payable at the regular payment dates on which such payments would otherwise have been made. Executive's rights to the payment provided in this Section 3.2 shall not be terminated by the application of Section 4.2 of this Agreement.
3.2
Salary Continuation and Bonus
 
. Following the occurrence of a Termination Event, to the extent permitted by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and by the Company's group health insurance policies, Executive and his covered dependents will be eligible to continue their health insurance benefits at their own expense. If Executive elects COBRA continuation, the Company shall pay Executive and his covered dependents' COBRA continuation premiums through the end of the Company's fiscal year ending October 31, 2005, provided that the Company's obligation to make such payments shall
3.3
Health Insurance Coverage
 
cease immediately to the extent that Executive and/or his covered dependents are no longer entitled to receive COBRA continuation coverage. Executive agrees to notify a duly authorized officer of the Company, in writing, immediately upon Executive or a covered dependent beginning to receive health benefits from another source, or as otherwise required by COBRA.
 
This Section 3.3 provides only for the Company's payment of COBRA continuation premiums for the periods specified above. This Section 3.3 does not affect the rights of Executive or Executive's covered dependents under any applicable law with respect to health insurance continuation coverage.
 
. Executive's stock options that are outstanding as of the date of the Termination Event (the "Stock Options") shall become fully vested upon the occurrence of the Termination Event and exercisable so long as Executive complies with the restrictions and limitations set forth in Article IV. The maximum period of time during which the Stock Options shall remain exercisable, and all other terms and conditions of the Stock Options, shall be as specified in the relevant Stock Option agreements and relevant stock plans under which the Stock Options were granted. The term "Stock Options" shall not include any rights of the Executive under the Company's employee stock purchase plan.
3.4
Stock Award Acceleration
 
Executive's restricted stock awards that are outstanding as of the date of the Termination Event ("Restricted Stock") shall become fully vested and free from any contractual rights of the Company to repurchase or otherwise reacquire the Restricted Stock as a result of Executive's termination of employment. All shares of Restricted Stock which have not yet been delivered to Executive or his designee (whether because subject to joint escrow instructions or otherwise) shall be promptly delivered to Executive or his designee upon the occurrence of a Termination Event.
 
In the event of a Change of Control, Executive shall be guaranteed to receive an amount for any Performance Period under the LTPP (as defined below) equal to the greater of (i) the Target Award (as defined in the LTPP) for such Performance Period or (ii) the accrued amount of the payout (i.e. the amount accrued as the expected liability for the LTPP by the Company's corporate finance department) as of the date of the closing of the Change of Control for such Performance Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company amends or modifies the LTPP after the closing of a Change of Control and Executive would receive a larger amount under such revised LTPP, Executive shall receive such amount in lieu of any amounts to be paid under this Section 3.5. Any payment for any Performance Period under the LTPP shall be made at the earliest of the end of such Performance Period, the termination date of the LTPP or the date of a Termination Event. For purposes of this Section 3.5, "LTPP" shall mean the Long-term Performance Program Description for Section 16 Officers, as amended and restated effective November 1, 2004, as it may be amended from time to time and as in effect as of the date of the closing of the Change of Control, without giving effect to any terminations, amendments or modifications occurring thereafter. Executive's rights to the payment provided in this Section 3.5 shall not be terminated by the application of Section 4.2 of this Agreement
3.5 Long-Term Performance.
 
To the extent required to avoid the application of any excise tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, any payment or benefit under this Agreement that would otherwise be payable earlier than six months following a Termination Event shall instead become payable on the date that is six months from the Termination Event.
3.5
Section 409A of Internal Revenue Code.
 
. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, Executive shall not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits after the date of the Termination Event, or otherwise.
3.6
Mitigation
 
 
 
. The benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of any benefit provided under any other severance plan, program or arrangement of the Company in effect at the time of a Termination Event. The Company shall withhold appropriate federal, state or local income, employment and other applicable taxes from any payments hereunder.
4.1
Reduction in Payments and Benefits; Withholding Taxes
 
4.2 Obligations of the Executive.
 
(a) For two years following the Termination Event, Executive agrees not to personally solicit any of the employees either of the Company or of any entity in which the Company directly or indirectly possesses the ability to determine the voting of 50% or more of the voting securities of such entity (including two-party joint ventures in which each party possesses 50% of the total voting power of the entity) to become employed elsewhere or provide the names of such employees to any other company which Executive has reason to believe will solicit such employees.
 
(b) Following the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive agrees to continue to satisfy his obligations under the terms of the Company's standard form of Proprietary Information and Non-Disclosure Agreement previously executed by Executive (or any comparable agreement subsequently executed by Executive in substitution or supplement thereto). Executive's obligations under this Section 4.2(b) shall not be limited to the Term.
 
. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, and prior to the receipt of any benefits under this Agreement on account of the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive shall, as of the date of a Termination Event, execute an employee release substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A as shall be determined by the Company. Such employee release shall specifically relate to all of Executive's rights and claims in existence at the time of such execution relating to Executive's employment with the Company, but shall not include (i) Executive's rights under this Agreement; (ii) Executive's rights under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company; or (iii) Executive's rights to indemnification under the Company's bylaws or other governing instruments or under any agreement addressing such subject matter between Executive and the Company. It is understood that Executive has twenty-one (21) days to consider whether to execute such employee release and Executive may revoke such employee release within seven
4.3
Employee Release Prior to Receipt of Benefits
 
(7) business days after execution of such employee release. In the event Executive does not execute such employee release within the twenty-one (21) day period, or if Executive revokes such employee release within the seven (7) business day period, no benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and this Agreement shall be null and void. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the scope or time of applicability of such employee release once it is executed and not timely revoked.
 
4.4 Certain Reductions in Payments.
 
(a) In the event that any payment received or to be received by Executive pursuant to this Agreement ("Payment") would (i) constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and (ii) but for this subsection (a), be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any comparable federal, state, local or foreign excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, is hereinafter referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then, subject to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, such Payment shall be either (A) delivered in full pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (B) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such severance payments and other benefits being subject to the Excise Tax ("Reduced Amount"), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, local and foreign income, employment and other taxes and the Excise Tax (including, without limitation, any interest or penalties on such taxes), results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance payments and benefits provided for hereunder, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments and benefits may be subject to the Excise Tax. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 4.4 shall be made by independent tax counsel designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Executive ("Independent Tax Counsel"), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required under this Section 4.4, Independent Tax Counsel may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Executive shall furnish to Independent Tax Counsel such information and documents as Independent Tax Counsel may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 4.4. The Company shall bear all costs that Independent Tax Counsel may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 4.4. In the event that Section 4.4(a)(ii)(B) above applies, then based on the information provided to Executive and the Company by Independent Tax Counsel, Executive may, in the Executive's sole discretion and within 30 days of the date which Executive is provided with the information prepared by Independent Tax Counsel, determine which and how much of the Payments to be otherwise received by Executive shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such determination the value (as calculated by Independent Tax Counsel in accordance with the provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code) of the amounts payable or distributable to Executive hereunder equals the Reduced Amount). If the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") determines that a Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, then subsection (b) hereof shall apply, and the enforcement of subsection (b) shall be the exclusive remedy to the Company.
 
(b) If, notwithstanding any reduction described in subsection (a) hereof (or in the absence of any such reduction), the IRS determines that Executive is liable for the Excise
 
Tax as a result of the receipt of one or more Payments, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within 30 days after a final IRS determination, an amount of such Payments equal to the "Repayment Amount." The Repayment Amount with respect to such Payments shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive's net proceeds with respect to such Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax imposed on such Payments) shall be maximized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Repayment Amount with respect to such Payments shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not eliminate the Excise Tax imposed on such Payments. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this subsection (b), Executive shall pay the Excise Tax.
 
. This Agreement may be changed or terminated only upon the mutual written consent of the Company and Executive. The written consent of the Company to a change or termination of this Agreement must be signed by an authorized officer of the Company, after such change or termination has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
4.5
Amendment or Termination of This Agreement
 
 
 
. Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plans, programs, policies or practices provided by the Company and for which Executive may otherwise qualify, nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as Executive may have under any stock option or other agreements with the Company; , , that in accordance with Section 4.1, any benefits provided hereunder shall be in lieu of any other severance benefits to which Executive may otherwise be entitled, including without limitation, under any employment contract or severance plan. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, amounts which are vested benefits or which Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice or program of the Company at or subsequent to the date of a Termination Event shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program.
5.1
Nonexclusivity

however
 
. This Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on Executive any obligation to remain as an employee, or impose on the Company any obligation (i) to retain Executive as an employee, (ii) to change the status of Executive as an at-will employee, or (iii) to change the Company's policies regarding termination of employment.
5.2
Employment Status
