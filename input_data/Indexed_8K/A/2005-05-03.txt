On May 3, 2005, the Company entered into a Change of Control Severance Agreement (the "Change of Control Agreement") with Mr. Cooper. The Change of Control Agreement sets out severance benefits that become payable if an executive either (i) is involuntarily terminated without cause within 24 months following a change of control or (ii) voluntarily terminates his or her employment within 3 months of an event constituting good reason, so long as the event occurs within 24 months following a change of control. The severance benefits under the Change of Control Agreement will consist of the following: (i) a severance payment equal to 200% of the executive's annual base salary and target bonus; (ii) continuation of health coverage by having the Company pay the executive's COBRA premiums for up to 12 months; (iii) vesting of all outstanding stock options and any restricted stock; and (iv) the prorated amount, if any, under any applicable variable pay programs for the year of termination. The Change of Control Agreement also provides that any long-term performance plan award shall become payable upon a change of control. The foregoing summary of the Change of Control Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On May 3, 2005, the Company entered into an Indemnification Agreement with Mr. Cooper. The form of indemnification agreement was previously approved by the Company's Board of Directors, and, for convenience, is provided as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The Indemnification Agreement provides, among other terms, that: (i) the Company will indemnify the indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to any claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, by reason of the fact that indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, of any
subsidiary of the Company, or of another corporation and serving in such capacity at the request of the Company; (ii) the Company will advance all expenses incurred by the indemnitee; (iii) if upon review the determination is made that applicable law does not permit indemnification, the Company is entitled to reimbursement of expense advances; and (iv) the indemnification provided by the Indemnification Agreement shall be in addition to any rights to which the indemnitee may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, its Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise. The indemnification provided under the Indemnification Agreement shall continue for any action taken while serving in an indemnified capacity even though the indemnitee may have ceased to serve in an indemnified capacity. The foregoing summary of the Indemnification Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.2 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10.1
 
CONFIDENTIAL
 
 
This Change of Control Severance Agreement (the "") is entered into this 3rd day of May, 2005 (the "Effective Date") between David B. Cooper, Jr. ("Executive") and Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""). This Agreement is intended to provide Executive with the compensation and benefits described herein upon the occurrence of specific events following a change of control of the ownership of the Company (defined as "Change of Control").
Agreement
Company
 
 
As is the case with most, if not all, publicly traded businesses, it is expected that the Company from time to time may consider or may be presented with the need to consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change in control of the ownership of the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that such considerations can be a distraction to Executive and can cause the Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities or to be influenced by the impact of a possible change in control of the ownership of the Company on Executive's personal circumstances in evaluating such possibilities. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control of the Company.
A.
 
The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide Executive with an incentive to continue his or her employment and to motivate Executive to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its shareholders.
B.
 
The Board believes that it is important to provide Executive with certain benefits upon Executive's termination of employment in certain instances upon or following a Change of Control that provide Executive with enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to Executive to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.
C.
 
At the same time, the Board expects the Company to receive certain benefits in exchange for providing Executive with this measure of financial security and incentive under the Agreement. Therefore, the Board believes that the Executive should provide various specific commitments which are intended to assure the Company that Executive will not direct Executive's skills, experience and knowledge to the detriment of the Company for a period not to exceed the period during which payments are being made to Executive under this Agreement.
D.
 
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Article VII.
E.
 
The Company and Executive hereby agree as follows:
 
 
 
Executive is currently employed as Senior Vice President, Finance, and Treasurer.
1.1
 
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect commencing on the Effective Date so long as Executive is employed by Company; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of the parties hereto contained in Articles III through VIII shall survive any termination for the longer of (i) twenty-four (24) months following a Termination Event (as hereinafter defined) (the "Term") or (ii) such longer period provided for in this Agreement.
1.2
 
The Company and Executive each agree and acknowledge that Executive is employed by the Company as an "at-will" employee and that either Executive or the Company has the right at any time to terminate Executive's employment with the Company, with or without cause or advance notice, for any reason or for no reason. The Company and Executive wish to set forth the compensation and benefits which Executive shall be entitled to receive in the event that Executive's employment with the Company terminates under the circumstances described in Article II of this Agreement.
1.3
 
The duties and obligations of the Company to Executive under this Agreement shall be in consideration for Executive's past services to the Company, Executive's continued employment with the Company, Executive's compliance with the obligations described in Section 4.2, and Executive's execution of the general waiver and release described in Section 4.3. The Company and Executive agree that Executive's compliance with the obligations described in Section 4.2 and Executive's execution of the general waiver and release described in Section 4.3 are preconditions to Executive's entitlement to the receipt of benefits under this Agreement and that these benefits shall not be earned unless all such conditions have been satisfied through the scheduled date of payment. The Company hereby declares that it has relied upon Executive's commitments under this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Article IV, and would not have been induced to enter into this Agreement or to execute this Agreement in the absence of such commitments.
1.4
 
 
 
2.1 Involuntary Termination Upon or Following Change of Control.
 
(a) In the event Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated at any time by the Company without Cause either at the time of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, such termination of employment will be a Termination Event and the Company shall pay Executive the compensation and benefits described in Article III.
 
(b) In the event Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries is either involuntarily terminated by the Company with Cause at any time, or is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause at any time other than either at the time of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, then such
 
termination of employment will be a Termination Event, Executive will be entitled to receive any payments or benefits under the provisions of this Agreement, and the Company will cease paying compensation or providing benefits to Executive as of Executive's termination date.

2.2 Voluntary Termination Upon or Following Change of Control.
 
(a) Executive may voluntarily terminate his employment with the Company and its subsidiaries at any time. In the event Executive voluntarily terminates his employment within three (3) months of the occurrence of an event constituting Good Reason and on account of an event constituting Good Reason, which event occurs either at the time of or within twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a Change of Control, then such termination of employment will be a Termination Event and the Company shall pay Executive the compensation and benefits described in Article III.
 
(b) In the event (i) Executive voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason other than on account of an event constituting Good Reason under the circumstances described in Section 2.2(a), or (ii) Executive's employment terminates on account of either death or physical or mental disability, then such termination of employment will be a Termination Event, Executive will be entitled to receive any payments or benefits under the provisions of this Agreement, and the Company will cease paying compensation or providing benefits to Executive as of the Executive's termination date.
not
not
 
 
 
. If a Termination Event occurs, Executive shall be entitled to receive the benefits described in this Agreement so long as Executive complies with the restrictions and limitations set forth in Article IV. If a Termination Event does not occur, Executive shall not be entitled to receive any benefits described in this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically set forth herein.
3.1
Right to Benefits
 
. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive shall receive two times the sum of Executive's Base Salary and Target Bonus, less any applicable withholding of federal, state or local taxes. Such salary and bonus continuation shall be paid in equal semi-annual installments over the two year period following the date of the Termination Event.
3.2
Salary Continuation
 
. Following the occurrence of a Termination Event, to the extent permitted by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and by the Company's group health insurance policies, Executive and his covered dependents will be eligible to continue their health insurance benefits at their own expense. If Executive elects COBRA continuation, the Company shall pay Executive and his covered dependents' COBRA continuation premiums for twelve (12) months following the date of the Termination Event, provided that the Company's obligation to make such payments shall cease immediately to the extent that Executive and/or his covered dependents are no longer entitled to receive COBRA continuation coverage. Executive agrees to notify a duly authorized officer of the Company, in writing, immediately upon Executive or a covered dependent beginning to receive health benefits from another source, or as otherwise required by COBRA.
3.3
Health Insurance Coverage
 
This Section 3.3 provides only for the Company's payment of COBRA continuation premiums for the periods specified above. This Section 3.3 does not affect the rights of Executive or Executive's covered dependents under any applicable law with respect to health insurance continuation coverage.
 
. Executive's stock options which are outstanding as of the date of the Termination Event (the "Stock Options") shall become fully vested upon the occurrence of the Termination Event and exercisable so long as Executive complies with the restrictions and limitations set forth in Article IV. The maximum period of time during which the Stock Options shall remain exercisable, and all other terms and conditions of the Stock Options, shall be as specified in the relevant Stock Option agreements and relevant stock plans under which the Stock Option were granted. The term "Stock Options" shall not include any rights of the Executive under the Company's employee stock purchase plan.
3.4
Stock Award Acceleration
 
Executive's restricted stock awards that are outstanding as of the date of the Termination Event ("Restricted Stock") shall become fully vested and free from any contractual rights of the Company to repurchase or otherwise reacquire the Restricted Stock as a result of Executive's termination of employment. All shares of Restricted Stock which have not yet been delivered to Executive or his designee (whether because subject to joint escrow instructions or otherwise) shall be promptly delivered to Executive or his designee upon the occurrence of a Termination Event.
 
3.5 Long Term Performance.
 
(a) In the event of a Change of Control, Executive shall be guaranteed to receive an amount for any Performance Period under the LTPP (as defined below) equal to the greater of (i) the Target Award (as defined in the LTPP) for such Performance Period or (ii) the accrued amount of the payout (i.e. the amount accrued as the expected liability for the LTPP by the Company's corporate finance department) as of the date of the closing of the Change of Control for such Performance Period, both as prorated on the basis of the percentage of time from the commencement of such Performance Period to the date of the closing of the Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company amends or modifies the LTPP after the closing of a Change of Control and Executive would receive a larger amount under such revised LTPP, Executive shall receive such amount in lieu of any amounts to be paid under this Section 3.5. Any payment for any Performance Period under the LTPP shall be made at the earliest of the end of such Performance Period, the termination date of the LTPP or the date of a Termination Event. For purposes of this Section 3.5, "LTPP" shall mean the Long-term Performance Program Description for Section 16 Officers, effective November 1, 2003, as it may be amended from time to time and as in effect as of the date of the closing of the Change of Control, without giving effect to any terminations, amendments or modifications occurring thereafter.
 
(b) Executive's rights to the payment provided in this Section 3.5 shall not be terminated by the application of Section 4.2 of this Agreement.
 
. If a Termination Event occurs, Executive shall receive a bonus for the performance period in which the Termination Event occurs. The amount of the bonus shall be equal to the amount of the bonus the Executive would have been paid had the Executive continued his employment with the Company until the end of such performance period multiplied by a fraction in which (i) the numerator is the number of days from and including the first day of the performance period until and including the date of the Termination Event, and (ii) the denominator is the number of days in the performance period. Such bonus shall be paid on the date Executive would have received the bonus if the Termination Event had not occurred during such performance period. Executive's rights to the payment provided in this Section 3.6 shall not be terminated by the application of Section 4.2 of this Agreement.
3.6
Bonus
 
. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, Executive shall not be required to mitigate damages or the amount of any payment provided under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment provided for under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of employment by another employer or by retirement benefits after the date of the Termination Event, or otherwise.
3.7
Mitigation
 
 
 
. The benefits provided under this Agreement are in lieu of any benefit provided under any other severance plan, program or arrangement of the Company in effect at the time of a Termination Event. The Company shall withhold appropriate federal, state or local income, employment and other applicable taxes from any payments hereunder.
4.1
Reduction in Payments and Benefits; Withholding Taxes
 
4.2 Obligations of the Executive.
 
(a) For two years following the Termination Event, Executive agrees not to personally solicit any of the employees either of the Company or of any entity in which the Company directly or indirectly possesses the ability to determine the voting of 50% or more of the voting securities of such entity (including two-party joint ventures in which each party possesses 50% of the total voting power of the entity) to become employed elsewhere or provide the names of such employees to any other company which Executive has reason to believe will solicit such employees.
 
(b) Following the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive agrees to continue to satisfy his obligations under the terms of the Company's standard form of Proprietary Information and Non-Disclosure Agreement previously executed by Executive (or any comparable agreement subsequently executed by Executive in substitution or supplement thereto). Executive's obligations under this Section 4.2(b) shall not be limited to the Term.
 
(c) Executive acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and accordingly agrees that for one year following the Termination Event, Executive will not, whether on Executive's own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person, company, business entity or other organization whatsoever, directly or indirectly, either (i) engage in any business which is a Competitive
 
Business, or (ii) enter the employ of, or render any services to, any person or entity (or any division of any person or entity) which engages in a Competitive Business. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Competitive Business" shall include any person or entity that competes with any business of the Company or its affiliates at the time of the Termination Event (including, without limitation, businesses which the Company or its affiliates have specific plans at the time of the Termination Event to conduct in the future and as to which plans Executive is aware at that time) in any geographical area where the Company or its affiliates manufacture, sell, lease, rent, license, or otherwise provide their products or services (including, without limitation, geographical areas where the Company or its affiliates have specific plans at the time of the Termination Event to engage in one or more such activities and as to which plans Executive is aware at that time). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a person or entity shall be treated as a Competitive Business for purposes of this Agreement only if the Company includes such person or entity (which, unless otherwise specified by the Company, shall be considered to include all of the subsidiaries and other affiliates of such listed person or entity) on a list to be prepared by the Company at or shortly after the time of the Termination Event, the list is provided to the Executive, and the Company's list shall include no more than 15 persons and entities.
 
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a violation of this Section 4.2(c) if any one or more of the following shall occur:
 
(1) Executive may own, directly or indirectly, solely as a passive investment, securities of any person engaged in a Competitive Business, which securities are publicly traded on a national or regional stock exchange or on the over-the-counter market if Executive (A) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such person, and (B) does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such person.
 
(2) If Executive is providing services to or for the benefit of an entity which has portions of its business which constitute a Competitive Business and portions of which do not constitute a Competitive Business, Executive may provide services to such entity so long as Executive does not provide services, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of such Competitive Business.
 
(3) If Executive is providing services to or for the benefit of an entity which does not engage in a Competitive Business, and such entity subsequently is acquired by a person or entity which does engage in a Competitive Business, Executive may continue such employment so long as Executive does not personally engage, directly or indirectly, in such Competitive Business or otherwise advise or assist such Competitive Business.
 
(d) It is expressly understood and agreed that although Executive and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Section 4 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against Executive, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void, but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time or territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
 
(e) Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of Section 4.2(a), Section 4.2(b), or Section 4.2(c) would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Executive agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to cease making any payments or providing any benefit otherwise required by this Agreement and, with respect to a breach or threatened breach of Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.2(b) only, obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction, or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
 
. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, and prior to the receipt of any benefits under this Agreement on account of the occurrence of a Termination Event, Executive shall, as of the date of a Termination Event, execute an employee release substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A as shall be determined by the Company. Such employee release shall specifically relate to all of Executive's rights and claims in existence at the time of such execution relating to Executive's employment with the Company, but shall not include (i) Executive's rights under this Agreement; (ii) Executive's rights under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company; or (iii) Executive's rights to indemnification under the Company's bylaws or other governing instruments or under any agreement addressing such subject matter between Executive and the Company. It is understood that Executive has twenty-one (21) days to consider whether to execute such employee release and Executive may revoke such employee release within seven (7) business days after execution of such employee release. In the event Executive does not execute such employee release within the twenty-one (21) day period, or if Executive revokes such employee release within the seven (7) business day period, no benefits shall be payable under this Agreement and this Agreement shall be null and void. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the scope or time of applicability of such employee release once it is executed and not timely revoked.
4.3
Employee Release Prior to Receipt of Benefits
 
4.4 Certain Reductions in Payments.
 
(a) In the event that any payment received or to be received by Executive pursuant to this Agreement ("Payment") would (i) constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and (ii) but for this subsection (a), be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any comparable federal, state, local or foreign excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, is hereinafter referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then, subject to the provisions of subsection (b) hereof, such Payment shall be either (A) delivered in full pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (B) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such severance payments and other benefits being subject to the Excise Tax ("Reduced Amount"), whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state, local and foreign income, employment and other taxes and the Excise Tax (including, without limitation, any interest or penalties on such taxes), results in the receipt by the Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance payments and benefits provided for hereunder, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance payments and benefits may be subject to the Excise Tax. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 4.4 shall be made by independent
 
tax counsel designated by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Executive ("Independent Tax Counsel'), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required under this Section 4.4, Independent Tax Counsel may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Executive shall furnish to Independent Tax Counsel such information and documents as Independent Tax Counsel may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 4.4. The Company shall bear all costs that Independent Tax Counsel may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 4.4. In the event that Section 4.4(a)(ii)(B) above applies, then based on the information provided to Executive and the Company by Independent Tax Counsel, Executive may, in the Executive's sole discretion and within 30 days of the date which Executive is provided with the information prepared by Independent Tax Counsel, determine which and how much of the Payments to be otherwise received by Executive shall be eliminated or reduced (as long as after such determination the value (as calculated by Independent Tax Counsel in accordance with the provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code) of the amounts payable or distributable to Executive hereunder equals the Reduced Amount). If the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") determines that a Payment is subject to the Excise Tax, then subsection (b) hereof shall apply, and the enforcement of subsection (b) shall be the exclusive remedy to the Company.
 
(b) If, notwithstanding any reduction described in subsection (a) hereof (or in the absence of any such reduction), the IRS determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of one or more Payments, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within 30 days after a final IRS determination, an amount of such Payments equal to the "Repayment Amount." The Repayment Amount with respect to such Payments shall be the smallest such amount, if any, as shall be required to be paid to the Company so that Executive's net proceeds with respect to such Payments (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax imposed on such Payments) shall be maximized. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Repayment Amount with respect to such Payments shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not eliminate the Excise Tax imposed on such Payments. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this subsection (b), Executive shall pay the Excise Tax.
 
. This Agreement may be changed or terminated only upon the mutual written consent of the Company and Executive. The written consent of the Company to a change or termination of this Agreement must be signed by an authorized officer of the Company, after such change or termination has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.
4.5
Amendment or Termination of This Agreement
 
 
 
. Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent or limit Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plans, programs, policies or practices provided by the Company and for which Executive may otherwise qualify,

Exhibit 10.2
 
 
 
This Indemnification Agreement () is entered into as of May 3rd, 2005 by and between Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ) and David B. Cooper, Jr. ().
"Agreement"
"Company"
"Indemnitee"
 
 
A. The Company and Indemnitee recognize the continued difficulty in obtaining liability insurance for its directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries, the significant increases in the cost of such insurance and the general reductions in the coverage of such insurance.
 
B. The Company and Indemnitee further recognize the substantial increase in corporate litigation in general, subjecting directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the availability and coverage of liability insurance has been severely limited.
 
C. Indemnitee does not regard the current protection available as adequate under the present circumstances, and Indemnitee and other directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries of the Company may not be willing to continue to serve in such capacities without additional protection.
 
D. The Company desires to attract and retain the services of highly qualified individuals, such as Indemnitee, to serve the Company and, in part, in order to induce Indemnitee to continue to provide services to the Company, wishes to provide for the indemnification and advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 
E. In view of the considerations set forth above, the Company desires that Indemnitee be indemnified by the Company as set forth herein.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Company and Indemnitee hereby agree as follows:
 
1. .
Indemnification
 
(a) . The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law if Indemnitee was or is or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
Indemnification of Expenses
 
or any hearing, inquiry or investigation that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute resolution mechanism, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other (hereinafter a ) by reason of (or arising in part out of) any event or occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, agent or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action or inaction on the part of Indemnitee while serving in such capacity (hereinafter an ) against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any such action, suit, proceeding, alternative dispute resolution mechanism, hearing, inquiry or investigation), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of such Claim and any federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Agreement (collectively, hereinafter ), including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses. Such payment of Expenses shall be made by the Company as soon as practicable but in any event no later than five days after written demand by Indemnitee therefor is presented to the Company.
"Claim"
"Indemnifiable Event"
"Expenses"
 
(b) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the obligations of the Company under Section 1(a) shall be subject to the condition that the Reviewing Party (as described in Section 10(e) hereof) shall not have determined (in a written opinion, in any case in which the Independent Legal Counsel referred to in Section 1(c) hereof is involved) that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law, and (ii) the obligation of the Company to make an advance payment of Expenses to Indemnitee pursuant to Section 2(a) (an ) shall be subject to the condition that, if, when and to the extent that the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be so indemnified under applicable law, the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Indemnitee (who hereby agrees to reimburse the Company) for all such amounts theretofore paid; provided, however, that if Indemnitee has commenced or thereafter commences legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure a determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, any determination made by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee would not be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law shall not be binding and Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance until a final judicial determination is made with respect thereto (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed). Indemnitees' obligation to reimburse the Company for any Expense Advance shall be unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon. If there has not been a Change in Control (as defined in Section 10(c) hereof), the Reviewing Party shall be selected by the Board of Directors, and if there has been such a Change in Control (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control), the Reviewing Party shall be the Independent Legal Counsel referred to in Section 1(c) hereof. If there has been no determination by the Reviewing Party or if
Reviewing Party
"Expense Advance"
 
the Reviewing Party determines that Indemnitee substantively would not be permitted to be indemnified in whole or in part under applicable law, Indemnitee shall have the right to commence litigation seeking an initial determination by the court or challenging any such determination by the Reviewing Party or any aspect thereof, including the legal or factual bases therefor, and the Company hereby consents to service of process and to appear in any such proceeding. Any determination by the Reviewing Party otherwise shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and Indemnitee.
 
(c) . The Company agrees that if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) then, with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitees to payments of Expenses and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as now or hereafter in effect, Independent Legal Counsel (as defined in Section 10(d) hereof) shall be selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Such counsel, among other things, shall render its written opinion to the Company and Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent Indemnitee would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law and the Company agrees to abide by such opinion. The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Legal Counsel referred to above and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.
Change in Control
 
(d) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement other than Section 9 hereof, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including, without limitation, the dismissal of an action without prejudice, in defense of any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation referred to in Section (1)(a) hereof or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection therewith.
Mandatory Payment of Expenses
 
2. .
Expenses; Indemnification Procedure
 
(a) . The Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee. The advances to be made hereunder shall be paid by the Company to Indemnitee as soon as practicable but in any event no later than five days after written demand by Indemnitee therefor to the Company.
Advancement of Expenses
 
(b) . Indemnitee shall, as a condition precedent to Indemnitees' right to be indemnified under this Agreement, give the Company notice in writing as soon as practicable of any Claim made against Indemnitee for which indemnification will or could be sought under this Agreement. Notice to the Company shall be directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the address shown on the signature page of this Agreement (or such other address as the Company shall designate in writing to Indemnitee). In addition, Indemnitee shall give the Company such information and cooperation as it may reasonably require and as shall be within Indemnitees' power.
Notice/Cooperation by Indemnitee
 
(c) . For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of , or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law. In addition, neither the failure of the Reviewing Party to have made a determination as to whether Indemnitee has met any particular standard of conduct or had any particular belief, nor an actual determination by the Reviewing Party that Indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct or did not have such belief, prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by Indemnitee to secure a judicial determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law, shall be a defense to Indemnitee's claim or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any particular standard of conduct or did not have any particular belief. In connection with any determination by the Reviewing Party or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled.
No Presumptions; Burden of Proof
nolo contendere
 
(d) . If, at the time of the receipt by the Company of a notice of a Claim pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, the Company has liability insurance in effect which may cover such Claim, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such Claim to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in accordance with the terms of such policies.
Notice to Insurers
 
(e) . In the event the Company shall be obligated hereunder to pay the Expenses of any Claim, the Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Claim with counsel approved by Indemnitee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, upon the delivery to Indemnitee of written notice of its election so to do. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by Indemnitee with respect to the same Claim; provided that, (i) Indemnitee shall have the right to employ Indemnitees' counsel in any such Claim at Indemnitee expense and (ii) if (A) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (B) Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there is a conflict of interest between the Company and Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense, or (C) the Company shall not continue to retain such counsel to defend such Claim, then the fees and expenses of Indemnitee counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall have the right to conduct such defense as it sees fit in its sole discretion, including the right to settle any claim against Indemnitee without the consent of the Indemnitee.
Selection of Counsel
 
3. .
Additional Indemnification Rights; Nonexclusivity
 
(a) . The Company hereby agrees to indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's Bylaws or by statute. In the event of any change after the date of this Agreement in any applicable law, statute or rule which expands the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its Board of Directors or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits afforded by such change. In the event of any change in any applicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of a Delaware corporation to indemnify a member of its Board of Directors or an officer, employee, agent or fiduciary, such change, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties' rights and obligations hereunder except as set forth in Section 8(a) hereof.
Scope
 
(b) . The indemnification provided by this Agreement shall be in addition to any rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, its Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise. The indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue as to Indemnitee for any action Indemnitee took or did not take while serving in an indemnified capacity even though Indemnitee may have ceased to serve in such capacity.
Nonexclusivity
 
4. . The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any Claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
No Duplication of Payments
 
5. . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses incurred in connection with any Claim, but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses to which Indemnitee are entitled.
Partial Indemnification
 
6. . Both the Company and Indemnitee acknowledge that in certain instances, Federal law or applicable public policy may prohibit the Company from indemnifying its directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries under this Agreement or otherwise. Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that the Company has undertaken or may be required in the future to undertake with the Securities and Exchange Commission to submit the question of indemnification to a court in certain circumstances for a determination of the Company's right under public policy to indemnify Indemnitee.
Mutual Acknowledgement
 
7. . To the extent the Company maintains liability insurance applicable to directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries, Indemnitee shall be covered by
Liability Insurance
 
such policies in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company's directors, if Indemnitee is a director; or of the Company's officers, if Indemnitee is not a director of the Company but is an officer; or of the Company's key employees, agents or fiduciaries, if Indemnitee is not an officer or director but is a key employee, agent or fiduciary.
 
8. . Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:
Exceptions
 
(a) . (i) To indemnify Indemnitee for Indemnitee's acts, omissions or transactions from which Indemnitee or the Indemnitee may not be indemnified under applicable law; or (ii) to indemnify Indemnity for Indemnity's intentional acts or transactions in violation of the Company's policies;
Excluded Action or Omissions
 
(b) . To indemnify or advance expenses to Indemnitee with respect to Claims initiated or brought voluntarily by Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except (i) with respect to actions or proceedings brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification under this Agreement or any other agreement or insurance policy or under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events, (ii) in specific cases if the Board of Directors has approved the initiation or bringing of such Claim, or (iii) as otherwise required under Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be;
Claims Initiated by Indemnitee
 
(c) . To indemnify Indemnitee for any expenses incurred by Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding instituted by Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous; or
Lack of Good Faith
 
(d) . To indemnify Indemnitee for expenses and the payment of profits arising from the purchase and sale by Indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute.
Claims Under Section 16(b)
 
9. . No legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's estate, spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; , , that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action, such shorter period shall govern.
