Ltd. providing for the sale of substantially all of the assets of Agilent's Semiconductor Products Group ("SPG"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the purchase price payable for SPG will be U.S. $2.66 billion, subject to adjustment based on a determination of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) and working capital at closing.

Lumileds Share Purchase Agreement
 
On August 12, 2005, Agilent entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Share Purchase Agreement") with Agilent LED International, Philips Lumileds Holding B.V. and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ("Philips") pursuant to which Agilent agreed to sell its stake in Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. ("Lumileds") to Philips.
 
Lumileds is a global joint venture between Agilent and Philips under a Second Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture Agreement"), dated as of November 29, 2004, between Agilent and Philips. Lumileds develops, manufactures and sells LEDs, modules, products and systems for a broad spectrum of lighting applications, including automotive lighting, high-brightness traffic signals, contour lighting and signs, outdoor illumination and white LEDs for both indoor and outdoor applications. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, as of the closing of the transaction the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements will be terminated.
 
The purchase price payable by Philips to Agilent under the Share Purchase Agreement is U.S. $948.5 million. Lumileds will also repay approximately $51.5 million in outstanding debt due to Agilent under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 31, 2001, by and among Lumileds, Philips, Agilent and Agilent Technologies Coordination Center S.C./C.V. The transaction is subject to antitrust approval.

On August 15, 2005, Agilent announced a restructuring plan to reduce its Global Infrastructure costs by more than $450 million, and infrastructure-related employment by about 1,300 jobs. This reduction will be accomplished through a combination of employee transfers to the divestiture and spin-off, attrition and work force reduction. Agilent expects this restructuring to be largely completed around the middle of fiscal year 2006, and the roughly $200 million implementation cost to be essentially offset by the proceeds of property and other asset sales.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, the completion of divestitures and Agilent's expected restructuring and the reduction of infrastructure costs following their completion.
 
These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to risks associated with the ability to effect the divestitures on a timely basis, risks associated with changes in demand for Agilent's products and risks associated with the development generally of Agilent's overall strategic objectives.
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties on our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2005. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

(i) Purchaser shall be entitled to occupy the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property as a licensee upon the terms and conditions contained in the Lease with Seller or its Subsidiary with respect to such Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property. Such license shall not be revocable due to the relevant Landlord's failure to consent, unless (A) the relevant Landlord formally, unconditionally refuses to consent and provides written notice stating that Purchaser's occupancy pursuant to the license violates the Lease with respect to the Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property, and (B) an enforcement action or forfeiture by the relevant Landlord due to Purchaser's occupation of such Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property cannot, in the reasonable opinion of Seller, be avoided other than by requiring Purchaser to immediately vacate the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property. In either such event, Seller may terminate the license by delivering written notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall vacate the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property immediately or by such other date as may be specified in a notice served by Seller, except that with respect to Business Significant Real Property, the Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into the Multi-Site License with respect to such Business Significant Real Property.

No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make any claim or demand against, or obtain reimbursement from, any Seller Indemnified Party with respect to any Purchaser Losses incurred as a consequence of being obliged to vacate an Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property or in obtaining alternative premises, including, without limitation, any enforcement action other than a Lease Enforcement Action which a Landlord may take against Purchaser.
Lease Enforcement Action
 
(ii) For as long as Purchaser occupies or is entitled to occupy such Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property as licensee as provided above, Purchaser shall, effective as of the Closing Date: (A) pay Seller all rents, service charges, insurance premiums and other sums payable by Seller or such Subsidiary under the relevant Lease of the Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property, but only with respect to the portion of the Subleased Real Property occupied by Purchaser, (B) subject to the
 
provisions of Section 2.2(b) hereof, observe and perform all of the covenants, obligations and conditions of Seller or such Subsidiary contained in the relevant Lease of the Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property and (C) indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless each Seller Indemnified Party from and against all Seller Losses arising on account of any breach thereof by Purchaser, other than Seller Losses incurred as a result of a Lease Enforcement Action with respect to any breach by Seller or its Subsidiaries of the relevant Lease by permitting Purchaser to occupy the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property without obtaining consent.
 
(c) If, despite the efforts of the Parties as set forth above, a Landlord of an Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property other than a Business Critical Real Property formally and unconditionally refuses to consent to the applicable assignment or sublease and provides written notice stating that Purchaser's occupancy violates the Lease with respect to such Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property:
 
(i) With respect to any such Assigned Real Property, without limiting the rights of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as set forth in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) below, Seller may, by written notice to Purchaser elect to apply to the relevant Landlord for consent to sublease to Purchaser all of the Assigned Real Property for the remainder of the relevant Lease term at a rent equal to the rent from time to time under the relevant Lease, and otherwise on substantially the same terms and conditions as the relevant Lease and pursuant to the terms of a reasonable sublease form prepared by Seller or such Subsidiary. If Seller makes such an election after the Closing Date (or before the Closing Date, if the Landlord consent is not received before the Closing Date), the provisions of Section 2.6(b) will apply; that upon receipt of the consent required to sublease the relevant Assigned Real Property, Seller shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary to sublease to Purchaser the Assigned Real Property as set forth herein.

such disclosure and, at the request of the other party, shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in maintaining the confidentiality of such information, including obtaining a protective order or other similar order. Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall limit in any respect either party's ability to disclose information in connection with the enforcement by such party of its rights under this Agreement; provided that the proviso of clause (v) in the immediately preceding sentence shall apply to the party desiring to disclose such information.

Each party acknowledges and agrees that its remedy for breach by the other party of the licenses granted to it hereunder during the applicable term of such licenses, or of any other provision hereof, shall be, subject to the requirements of Article VII, to bring a claim to recover damages subject to the limits set forth in this Agreement and to seek any other appropriate equitable relief, other than termination of the licenses granted by it in this Agreement.
 
 
Except as otherwise set forth herein, resolution of any and all disputes arising from or in connection with this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, or otherwise (collectively, ""), shall be exclusively governed by and settled in accordance with the provisions of this Article 7.

without the necessity of any formal proceedings.

The specific format for such negotiations will be left to the discretion of the designated negotiating teams but may include the preparation of agreed upon statements of fact or written statements of position furnished to the other party. All negotiations between the parties pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations. Nothing said or disclosed, nor any document produced, in the course of such negotiations that is not otherwise independently discoverable shall be offered or received as evidence or used for impeachment or for any other purpose in any current or future litigation.
 
7.2 FAILURE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. In the event that any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is not settled by the parties within 15 days after the first meeting of the second tier negotiating teams under Section 7.1, the parties may seek any remedies to which they may be entitled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
 
7.3 PROCEEDINGS. Nothing herein, however, shall prohibit either party from initiating litigation or other judicial or administrative proceedings if such party would be substantially harmed by a failure to act during the time that such good faith efforts are being made to resolve the dispute or claim through negotiation or mediation. In the event that litigation is commenced under this Section 7.3, the parties agree to continue to attempt to resolve any Dispute according to the terms of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 hereof during the course of such litigation proceedings under this Section 7.3.
 
7.4 PAY AND DISPUTE. Except as provided herein, in the event of any dispute regarding payment of a third-party invoice (subject to standard verification of receipt of products or services), the party named in a third party's invoice must make timely payment to such third party, even if the party named in the invoice desires to pursue the dispute resolution procedures outlined in this Article 7. If the party that paid the invoice is found pursuant to this Article 7 to not be responsible for such payment, such paying party shall be entitled to reimbursement, with interest accrued at an annual rate of the rate of interest as announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase at its principal office in New York City as its prime lending rate, the Prime Rate to change when and if such prime lending rate changes, from the party found responsible for such payment.

If Seller or Purchaser becomes aware that an Authorized Dealer is not complying with any Trademark Usage Guidelines, Purchaser (but not Seller) shall promptly notify such Authorized Dealer in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail a written description of the noncompliance and any requested action for curing such noncompliance. Such Authorized Dealer shall then have the Guideline Initial Cure Period to correct such noncompliance or submit to Purchaser a written plan to correct such noncompliance, which written plan is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller.
 
5.2 SECOND CURE PERIOD. If the noncompliance with the Trademark Usage Guidelines continues beyond the Guideline Initial Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller shall each promptly appoint a representative to negotiate in good faith actions that may be necessary to correct such noncompliance.

If the noncompliance with the Trademark Usage Guidelines by an Authorized Dealer remains uncured after the expiration of the Second Guideline Cure Period, then at Purchaser's election, such Authorized Dealer promptly shall cease using the non-complying Collateral Materials and/or Marketing Materials until Purchaser determines that such Authorized Dealer has demonstrated its ability and commitment to comply with the Trademark Usage Guidelines. Nothing in this Article V shall be deemed to limit Purchaser's obligations under Section 3.3 above or to preclude Seller from exercising any rights or remedies under Section 3.3 above.

Following receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall make an inquiry promptly and in good faith concerning each instance of noncompliance described in the notice. Purchaser shall then have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice ("Initial Cure Period") to correct such noncompliance or submit to Seller a written plan to correct such noncompliance, which written plan is reasonably acceptable to Seller, unless Seller previously affirmatively concurs in writing, in its sole discretion, that Purchaser or its Subsidiaries is not in noncompliance.
 
7.2 SECOND CURE PERIOD. If the said noncompliance with the Quality Standards continues beyond the Initial Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller shall each promptly appoint a representative to negotiate in good faith actions that may be necessary to correct such noncompliance. The parties shall have fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the Initial Cure Period to agree on corrective actions, and Purchaser shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of an agreement of corrective actions to implement such corrective actions and cure or cause the cure of such noncompliance ("Second Cure Period").
 
7.3 FINAL CURE PERIOD. If the said noncompliance with the Quality Standards by Purchaser or any Subsidiary (as the case may be) remains uncured after the expiration of the Second Cure Period, then at Seller's election, Purchaser or the non-complying Subsidiary (as the case may be) promptly shall cease offering the non-complying Licensed Products under the Licensed Marks until Seller reasonably determines that Purchaser, or the non-complying Subsidiary (as the case may be) has reasonably demonstrated its ability and
 
commitment to comply with the Quality Standards. Nothing in this Article VII shall be deemed to limit Purchaser's obligations under Section 3.3 above.

8.2 PROTECTION OF MARKS. Purchaser shall assist Seller, at Seller's request and expense, in the procurement and maintenance of Seller's respective intellectual property rights in the Licensed Marks. Purchaser will not grant or attempt to grant a security interest in the Licensed Marks or record any such security interest in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or elsewhere against any Trademark application or registration belonging to Seller. Purchaser agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, execute all documents reasonably requested by Seller to effect further registration of, maintenance and renewal of the Licensed Marks, recordation of the license relationship between Seller and Purchaser, and recordation of Purchaser as a registered user. Seller makes no warranty or representation that Trademark registrations have been or will be applied for, secured or maintained in the Licensed Marks throughout, or anywhere within, the world. Purchaser shall cause to appear on all Licensed Products, all Marketing Materials and all Collateral Materials, such legends, markings and notices as may be required by applicable law or reasonably requested by Seller.
 
8.3 SIMILAR MARKS. Purchaser agrees not to use or register in any country any Trademark that infringes on the rights of Seller in the Licensed Marks, or any element thereof. If any application for registration is, or has been, filed in any country by Purchaser which relates to any Trademark that infringes the rights of Seller in the Licensed Marks, Purchaser shall immediately abandon any such application or registration or assign it to Seller. Purchaser may not adopt any trademarks incorporating the root "Agil" or any other trademark similar to the Licensed Trademarks. Purchaser shall not challenge Seller's ownership of or the validity of the Licensed Marks or any application for registration thereof throughout the world. Purchaser shall not use or register in any country or jurisdiction, or permit others to use or register on its behalf in any country or jurisdiction, any copyright, domain name, telephone number, keyword, metatag, other electronic identifier or any other intellectual property right, whether recognized currently or in the future, or any other designation which would affect the ownership or rights of Seller in and to the Licensed Marks, or otherwise take any action which would adversely affect any of such ownership rights, or assist anyone else in doing so. Purchaser shall cause its Subsidiaries and Authorized Dealers to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.3.
 
8.4 INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS. In the event that the Purchaser learns, during the Term of this License, of any infringement or threatened infringement of the Licensed Marks, or any unfair competition, passing-off or dilution with respect to the Licensed
 
Marks, Purchaser shall immediately notify Seller or its authorized representative giving particulars thereof, and Purchaser shall provide necessary information and assistance to Seller or its authorized representatives at Seller's expense in the event that Seller decides that proceedings should be commenced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser is not obligated to monitor or police use of the Licensed Marks by Third Parties other than as specifically set forth in Section 3.3 hereof. Except for those actions initiated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof to enforce any sublicense or other agreement with any Subsidiary or Authorized Dealer, Seller shall have exclusive control of any litigation, opposition, cancellation or related legal proceedings. The decision whether to bring, maintain or settle any such proceedings shall be at the exclusive option and expense of Seller, and all recoveries shall belong exclusively to Seller. Purchaser shall not and shall have no right to initiate any litigation, opposition, cancellation or related legal proceedings with respect to the Licensed Marks in its own name (except for those actions initiated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof), but, at Seller's request, agrees to cooperate with Seller at Seller's expense to enforce its rights in the Licensed Marks, including to join or be joined as a party in any action taken by Seller against a third party for infringement or threatened infringement of the Licensed Marks, to the extent such joinder is required under mandatory local law for the prosecution of such an action. Seller shall incur no liability to Purchaser or any other Person under any legal theory by reason of Seller's failure or refusal to prosecute or by Seller's refusal to permit Purchaser to prosecute, any alleged infringement by Third Parties, nor by reason of any settlement to which Seller may agree.

(a) Upon any Sale occurring: (i) less than thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries of Seller Branded Products manufactured by Purchaser more than eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, or (ii) more than twenty-four months and less than thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries of Seller Branded Products (other than repaired, refurbished or reconstructed Seller Branded Products or repair parts) manufactured by Seller prior to the Closing Date or by Purchaser less than eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date Purchaser shall pay to Seller a         % royalty on the Net Sales earned by Purchaser in each Seller fiscal quarter as a result of such Sale.
,
 
(b) As used in this Article XI, "Net Sales" means the gross invoice price from: (i) royalty-bearing Sales under Section 11.1(a) above, in any case less: (1) charges for handling, freight, sales taxes, insurance costs and import duties where such items are included in the invoiced price, (2) point-of-sale credits (or other similar adjustments to price) granted to independent distributors, and (3) credits actually granted or refunds actually given for returns during such Seller fiscal quarter. In the event that the foregoing Seller Branded Products are Sold for no or nominal consideration or to a SubsidiaryAuthorized Dealer, affiliated company or in any other circumstances in which the selling price is established on other than an arms-length basis, the Net Sales on such Sales shall be determined on the average selling price earned
,
 
by Seller during the preceding Seller fiscal quarter on Sales of like volumes of the applicable Seller Branded Products to unaffiliated customers in arms-length sales. However, in the event that the foregoing Seller Branded Products are Sold to Seller's Subsidiaries, Authorized Dealers or affiliated companies for resale to Third Parties, then the royalties will be based on Net Sales from the Subsidiaries Authorized Dealers or affiliated companies to the Third Parties and no royalties will be due on the Sales to the Subsidiaries, Authorized Dealers or affiliated companies.
,
 
(c) For the purposes of clarification, no royalty is due under this Article XI for uses of the Licensed Marks that are covered by Section 10.8. Also, no royalties will accrue at any time for the use of Seller Part Numbers.
 
11.2 PAYMENTS AND ACCOUNTING.
 
(a) With respect to the royalties set forth herein, Seller shall keep full, clear and accurate records until otherwise provided in Section 11.2(b). These records shall be retained for a period of three (3) years from the date of payment notwithstanding the expiration or other termination of this License. Purchaser shall have the right, through a mutually agreed upon independent certified public accountant (consent to which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Purchaser), and at Seller's expense, to examine and audit, not more than once a year, and during normal business hours, all such records and such other records and accounts as may under recognized accounting practices contain information bearing upon the amount of royalty payable to Seller under this License. Prompt adjustment shall be made by either party to compensate for any errors and/or omissions disclosed by such examination or audit. Should any such error and/or omission result in an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) of the total royalties due for the period under audit, Purchaser shall, upon Seller's request, pay for the cost of the audit and pay Seller an additional fee equal to a compound annual interest rate of ten percent (10%) of such error and/or omission.
 
(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each Purchaser fiscal quarter, Purchaser shall furnish to Seller a statement in suitable form showing all Seller Branded Products subject to royalties that were sold, during such quarter, and the amount of royalty payable thereon. If no Licensed Products or services subject to royalty have been sold, that fact shall be shown on such statement. Also, within such forty-five (45) days, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the royalties payable hereunder for such quarter. Purchaser and Seller will determine the form of the statement prior to submission of the first such statement. All royalty and other payments to Seller hereunder shall be in United States dollars. Royalties based on sales in other currencies shall be converted to United States dollars according to the official rate of exchange for that currency, as published in the Wall Street Journal on the last day of the calendar month in which the royalty accrued (or, if not published on that day, the last publication day for the Wall Street Journal during that month). If two consecutive Purchaser fiscal quarters pass in which no royalties are due under this License and Purchaser reasonably believes no royalties will be due, the obligations pursuant to this Article XI shall terminate. If Purchaser resumes sale of Seller Branded Products that are subject to royalties, the obligations of this Article XI shall automatically resume.
 
 
12.1 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION. By written notice to Seller, Purchaser may voluntarily terminate all or a specified portion of the licenses and rights granted to it hereunder by Seller. Such notice shall specify the effective date of such termination and shall clearly specify any affected Licensed Marks and Licensed Products.
 
12.2 SURVIVAL. Any voluntary termination of licenses and rights of Purchaser under Section 12.1 hereof shall not affect Purchaser's licenses and rights with respect to any Licensed Products made or furnished prior to such termination.
 
 
13.1 NEGOTIATION. The parties shall make a good faith attempt to resolve any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this License through negotiation. Within thirty (30) days after notice of a dispute or claim is given by either party to the other party, the parties' first tier negotiating teams (as determined by each party's Director of Intellectual Property (or person holding a similar position or title) or his or her delegate) shall meet and make a good faith attempt to resolve such dispute or claim and shall continue to negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute or claim or renegotiate the applicable section or provision without the necessity of any formal proceedings. If the first tier negotiating teams are unable to agree within thirty (30) days of their first meeting, then the parties' second tier negotiating teams (as determined by each party's Director of Intellectual Property or his or her delegate) shall meet within thirty (30) days after the end of the first thirty (30) day negotiating period to attempt to resolve the matter. During the course of negotiations under this Section 13.1, all reasonable requests made by one party to the other for information, including requests for copies of relevant documents will be honored. The specific format for such negotiations will be left to the discretion of the designated negotiating teams but may include the preparation of agreed upon statements of fact or written statements of position furnished to the other party. All negotiations between the parties pursuant to this Section 13.1 shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations. Nothing said or disclosed, nor any document produced, in the course of such negotiations that is not otherwise independently discoverable shall be offered or received as evidence or used for impeachment or for any other purpose in any current or future litigation.
 
13.2 NONBINDING MEDIATION. In the event that any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this License is not settled by the parties within fifteen (15) days after the first meeting of the second tier negotiating teams under Section 13.1 hereof, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute or claim by nonbinding mediation in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Commercial Mediation Rules. The mediation shall be held within thirty (30) days of the end of such fifteen (15) day negotiation period of the second tier negotiating teams. Except as provided below in Section 13.3, no litigation for the resolution of such dispute may be commenced until the parties try in good faith to settle the dispute by such mediation in accordance with such rules, and either party has concluded in good faith that amicable resolution through continued mediation of the matter does not appear likely. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the parties to the mediation. Any settlement
 
reached by mediation shall be recorded in writing, signed by the parties, and shall be binding on them.
 
13.3 PROCEEDINGS. Nothing herein, however, shall prohibit either party from initiating litigation or other judicial or administrative proceedings if such party would be substantially harmed by a failure to act during the time that such good faith efforts are being made to resolve the dispute or claim through negotiation or mediation. In the event that litigation is commenced under this Section 13.3, the parties agree to continue to attempt to resolve any dispute or claim according to the terms of Sections 13.1 and 13.2 hereof during the course of such litigation proceedings under this Section 13.3.
 
 
IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this License shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.
