(the "Company") determined that it would restate its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 and interim financial data for the quarter ended October 31, 2004 (the "Restatement") included in its 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K due to an accounting error.  The decision to restate the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 was made by the Audit & Finance Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors.

This error was identified through the operation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the 2005 fiscal year. The Restatement decreases the Company's provision for income taxes for fiscal 2004 and the quarter ended October 31, 2004 by $20 million and increases net income by $20 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the same periods.  The Restatement has been included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 (the "Annual Report") which was filed on January 17, 2006.  The Restatement had no effect on the Company's segments' results of operations discussed in the Annual Report.
The Restatement reflects the Company's
