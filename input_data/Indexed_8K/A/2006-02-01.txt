ITEM 1.01.    ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. ("World Trade"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("Agilent"), entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the "Repurchase Agreement") with Fenway Capital, LLC (the "Counterparty") pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the "Purchased Securities"), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the Counterparty, and the Counterparty is obligated to sell to World Trade, the Purchased Securities at a purchase price equal to 100% of their aggregate liquidation preference on January 27, 2011.
 
Agilent applied $700 million of the proceeds from the Repurchase Agreement to repay in full the amount borrowed under the Credit Agreement entered into on December 14, 2005, among Agilent, World Trade, the initial lenders named therein and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation, as collateral and administrative agent, to help finance its previously announced share repurchase program of up to $4.466 billion, including the repurchase of its common stock pursuant to the modified "Dutch auction" self-tender offer consummated on December 19, 2005.  Agilent intends to apply the balance of the proceeds to finance additional purchases of its common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program and for general corporate purposes.  As of January 27, 2006, an additional approximate $1.2 billion of common stock remained to be purchased under the share repurchase program.
 
Under the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the Counterparty, at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to three-month LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Repurchase Agreement) plus 28 basis points.  World Trade is entitled to receive from the Counterparty from time to time amounts equal to all dividends and other distributions in respect of the Purchased Securities.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.
 
Pursuant to the Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc. dated as of January 27, 2006 (the "Agilent Guaranty"), Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade under the Repurchase Agreement.
 
The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default for repurchase agreements with respect to each of World Trade and the Counterparty, including failure to pay amounts owed under the Repurchase Agreement, insolvency events (including with respect to Agilent, as guarantor), breaches of representations (including with respect to Agilent, as guarantor) and the failure to provide various notifications required.  Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default thereunder, the non-defaulting party has the right to accelerate, or in the case of the occurrence of an insolvency event, the non-defaulting party will be deemed to have accelerated, the repurchase obligation of World Trade under the Repurchase Agreement.  Under the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities to any date prior to January 27, 2011 (an "Accelerated Repurchase Date").
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006 (the "Related Agreement"), among Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. ("Merrill Lynch"), Agilent and World Trade, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that World Trade shall be
obligated to designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all (or, in limited cases, a portion) of the Purchased Securities in the event World Trade receives written notice from Merrill Lynch (the "Merrill Lynch Notice") that either (i) the liquidity arrangement entered into between Merrill Lynch and the Counterparty is being terminated prior to January 27, 2011 or the short-term unsecured debt obligations of the Counterparty shall have ceased to be rated at least "A-1" by Standard & Poor's Rating Group or "P-1" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and, in either case, Merrill Lynch has been unable to arrange for one or more replacement counterparties reasonably acceptable to World Trade and Merrill Lynch, (ii) World Trade has refused to consent to the Counterparty's transfer of such rights and obligations to a replacement counterparty or (iii) there has been a change in law which causes it to become unlawful for Merrill Lynch or any of its affiliates to exercise any of its rights or perform any of its obligations under such liquidity arrangement or which, subject to certain conditions, otherwise materially and adversely affects the accounting, tax or regulatory treatment of Merrill Lynch or any of its affiliates as counterparty under such liquidity arrangement.  In the event World Trade optionally exercises its right under the Repurchase Agreement to designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date (subject to limited exceptions) and in certain additional circumstances, World Trade will be required to pay a make-whole premium to Merrill Lynch.
 
Upon receipt of the Merrill Lynch Notice, World Trade shall be obligated to designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date to occur no earlier than 180 days from the date of such notice and as designated by Merrill Lynch in such notice  with respect to all (or in limited cases a portion) of the Purchased Securities held by the Counterparty.  In the event that a financing shall be necessary to purchase all or a portion of the Purchased Securities on the Accelerated Repurchase Date, Agilent and World Trade shall jointly and severally be required to make additional payments to Merrill Lynch if either (A) any securities offering, if contemplated, is not commenced (or credit facilities, if contemplated, shall not have been entered into) within 120 days of receipt of the Merrill Lynch Notice or (B) whether or not a financing is contemplated, the Purchased Securities shall not have been purchased by the Accelerated Repurchase Date.  Such payments, shall be equal to .25% per annum on the aggregate liquidation preference of the relevant Purchased Securities for the first 180 days that either of such events shall have occurred and be continuing, increasing by .25% per annum for each subsequent 180-day period, subject to a maximum of 1.0% per annum.
 
In addition, Agilent and World Trade entered into the Agilent Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006, in favor of the Counterparty and certain other parties, regarding certain representations, warranties and covenants of Agilent and World Trade with respect to each and with respect to Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited and certain other subsidiaries of Agilent.
 
The foregoing agreements will result in the classification of approximately $1.6 billion of Agilent's investments as restricted on its balance sheet as of January 31, 2006.
 
A copy of the aforementioned agreements are included herein as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. 
The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements.

Initiation; Confirmation; Termination

(c)
  
 
4.
    
Margin Maintenance
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a "Margin Deficit"), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer ("Additional Purchased Securities"), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
  
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a "Margin Excess"), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
  
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(c)
  
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
  
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
(e)
  
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
   
 
5.
    
Income Payments
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
    
Security Interest
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
    
Payment and Transfer
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
8.
    
Segregation of Purchased Securities
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they [will]* [may]** be subject to liens granted by Seller to [its clearing bank]* [third parties]** and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy [the clearing]* [any]** lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
* Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.4(e) if Seller is a government securities broker or dealer other than a financial institution.
** Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.5(d) if Seller is a financial institution.
 
9.
    
Substitution
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
  
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; provided, however, that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
  
10
.
        
Representations
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, bylaw or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected. On the Purchase Date for any Transaction Buyer and Seller shall each be deemed to repeat all the foregoing representations made by it.
 
11
.
        
Events of Default
In the event that (i) Seller fails to transfer or Buyer fails to purchase Purchased Securities upon the applicable Purchase Date, (ii) Seller fails to repurchase or Buyer fails to transfer Purchased Securities upon the applicable Repurchase Date, (iii) Seller or Buyer fails to comply with Paragraph 4 hereof, (iv) Buyer fails, after one business day's notice, to comply with Paragraph 5 hereof, (v) an Act of Insolvency occurs with respect to Seller or Buyer, (vi) any representation made by Seller or Buyer shall have been incorrect or untrue in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated, or (vii) Seller or Buyer shall admit to the other its inability to, or its intention not to, perform any of its obligations hereunder (each an "Event of Default"):
 
The nondefaulting party may, at its option (which option shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency), declare an Event of Default to have occurred hereunder and, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of such option, the Repurchase Date for each Transaction hereunder shall, if it has not already occurred, be deemed immediately to occur (except that, in the event that the Purchase Date for any Transaction has not yet occurred as of the date of such exercise or deemed exercise, such Transaction shall be deemed immediately canceled). The nondefaulting party shall (except upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency) give notice to the defaulting party of the exercise of such option as promptly as practicable.
(a)
  
 
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, if the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, (i) the defaulting party's obligations in such Transactions to repurchase all Purchased Securities, at the Repurchase Price therefore on the Repurchase Date determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, (ii) all Income paid after such exercise or deemed exercise shall be retained by the nondefaulting party and applied to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, and (iii) the defaulting party shall immediately deliver to the nondefaulting party any Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions then in the defaulting party's possession or control.
(b)
  
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, upon tender by the nondefaulting party of payment of the aggregate Repurchase Prices for all such Transactions, all right, title and interest in and entitlement to all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions shall be deemed transferred to the nondefaulting party, and the defaulting party shall deliver all such Purchased Securities to the nondefaulting party.
(c)
  
 
If the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, the nondefaulting party, without prior notice to the defaulting party, may:
(d)
  
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, (A) immediately sell, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions and apply the proceeds thereof to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of selling all or a portion of such Purchased Securities, to give the defaulting party credit for such Purchased Securities in an amount equal to the price therefore on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing bid quotation from such a source, against the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder; and
(i)
   
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, (A) immediately purchase, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, securities ("Replacement Securities") of the same class and amount as any Purchased Securities that are not delivered by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party as required hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of purchasing Replacement Securities, to be deemed to have purchased Replacement Securities at the price therefore on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing offer quotation from such a source.
(ii)
  
 
Unless otherwise provided in Annex I, the parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Securities subject to any Transaction hereunder are instruments traded in a recognized market, (2) in the absence of a generally recognized source for prices or bid or offer quotations for any Security, the nondefaulting party may establish the source therefore in its sole discretion and (3) all prices, bids and offers shall be determined together with accrued Income (except to the extent contrary to market practice with respect to the relevant Securities).
 
As to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for any excess of the price paid (or deemed paid) by the nondefaulting party for Replacement Securities over the Repurchase Price for the Purchased Securities replaced thereby and for any amounts payable by the defaulting party under Paragraph 5 hereof or otherwise hereunder.
(e)
  
 
For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Repurchase Price for each Transaction hereunder in respect of which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer shall not increase above the
(f)
   
amount of such Repurchase Price for such Transaction determined as of the date of the exercise or deemed exercise by the nondefaulting party of the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
 
The defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for (i) the amount of all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the nondefaulting party in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, (ii) damages in an amount equal to the cost (including all fees, expenses and commissions) of entering into replacement transactions and entering into or terminating hedge transactions in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, and (iii) any other loss, damage, cost or expense directly arising or resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default in respect of a Transaction.
(g)
  
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for interest on any amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, from the date the defaulting party becomes liable for such amounts hereunder until such amounts are (i) paid in full by the defaulting party or (ii) satisfied in full by the exercise of the nondefaulting party's rights hereunder. Interest on any sum payable by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party under this Paragraph 11(h) shall be at a rate equal to the greater of the Pricing Rate for the relevant Transaction or the Prime Rate.
(h)
  
 
The nondefaulting party shall have, in addition to its rights hereunder, any rights otherwise available to it under any other agreement or applicable law.
(i)
   
 
12.

Intent
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a "repurchase agreement" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a "securities contract" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(a)
  
 
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(b)
  
 
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an "insured depository institution," as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended ("FDIA"), then each Transaction hereunder is a "qualified financial contract," as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(c)
  
 
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a "netting contract" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a "covered contractual payment entitlement" or "covered contractual payment obligation", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a "financial institution" as that term is defined in FDICIA).

in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("1934 Act"), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has
(a)
  
taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 ("SIPA") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
(b)
  
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of World Trade under or in respect of the Repo Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against World Trade or whether World Trade is joined in any such action or actions.

the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Counterparty, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Counterparty in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement.  If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Counterparty of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, the Counterparty will, at the Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.
 
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Counterparty and its successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns.
