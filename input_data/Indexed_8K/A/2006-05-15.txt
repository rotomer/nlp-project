We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.

It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the company's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the company. The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

PALO ALTO, Calif., May 15, 2006  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.59 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2006, 21 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.43 billion, 12 percent above last year. Second quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $131 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared with $53 million, or $0.11 per share, in last year's second quarter.
 
Included in GAAP results are $22 million of net charges related principally to the planned spinoff of Semiconductor Test Solutions (STS) and the reduction of Agilent's infrastructure costs. Excluding these charges and $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, Agilent reported second quarter adjusted net income of $178 million, or $0.40 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $84 million, or $0.17 per share, one year ago.(1)
"Agilent continued to deliver on its operating and strategic commitments during the second quarter of 2006," said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. "Both revenues and adjusted earnings per share were at the high end of our expectations. Preparations for a spinoff of STS are on schedule. As of mid-year, we have successfully reduced Agilent's global infrastructure to a level commensurate with a pure-play measurement company. Despite the separation and restructuring costs associated with these actions, Agilent generated approximately $300 million in cash from operating activities during the second quarter."
 
(2)during the quarter. "At this point," he said, "the fundamental strategic opportunity for this company is to leverage the robust operating model we've built through higher sustainable growth."
Sullivan noted that gross margins remained at the highest level in five years, that inventories were below 100 Days On Hand for the first time, and that the company achieved a 24 percent Return on Invested Capital
 
 
Looking ahead, Agilent (including STS) expects third quarter fiscal 2006 revenues of $1.37 billion to $1.43 billion, up 10 to 15 percent from last year. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.42 per share(3), roughly double last year's comparable earnings. Normal seasonality would suggest fourth quarter revenues roughly 5 percent above the third quarter and an increase in operating earnings of about $0.10 per share.
 
Note: The segment results listed below are for the Bio-Analytical Measurement and Electronic Measurement groups. Because of the planned spinoff of STS, Agilent is not reporting separate STS segment results at this time.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein.
The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenues, earnings and profitability; the pace of new product introductions and future demand for the Company's products and services; the planned spinoff of the Company's Semiconductor Test Solutions business, including the timing of the initial public offering of that business and completion of the spinoff; the Company's revenue and earnings (on a segment and consolidated basis); guidance for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2006; and future demand for the Company's products and services. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses; unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products and technologies; changes in the planned spinoff of the Semiconductor Test Solutions business, including complications in connection with the separation of STS assets from the Company and difficulties or delays in the expected spinoff process due to market conditions or regulatory delays.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business, the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix, and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Oct. 31, 2005. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.
(1)Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted net income is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from
 
the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
 
(3)Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q306 and Q406 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter.
 
 
(4)Historical segment data have been restated to correspond to current presentation.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, the impact of the sale of our businesses and investments from the results of the sales of our products. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services).  These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as restructuring charges and sales of investments can have a material impact on our cash flows and net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary adjusted net income and EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
 
 
ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end
balances of Segment Invested Capital)

Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
(b)
        
 
Note: Total Agilent segment return equals the sum of Agilent's segments. See reconcialiation between GAAP Net income and adjusted net income on Page 5.
 
Historical amounts were reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
