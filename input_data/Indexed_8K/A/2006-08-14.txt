We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future. We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.

This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the company's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the company. The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 14, 2006  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.42 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2006, 10 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.45 billion, 17 percent above last year. Third quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $233 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with $54 million, or $0.10 per share, in last year's third quarter.
Included in GAAP results are $86 million of charges related principally to the spinoff of Verigy Ltd. and the reduction of Agilent's infrastructure costs. Excluding these charges, $21 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, and $145 million of net gains from the sale of assets and other items, Agilent reported third quarter adjusted net income of $195 million, or $0.46 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $95 million, or $0.19 per share, one year ago.(1)

"Agilent performed well in the third quarter of 2006," said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. "Revenues were above expectations because of 10 percent year-to-year growth in the continuing operations of Agilent and the sustained strength of Verigy. Adjusted earnings per share were four cents above the high end of our guidance, and more than double last year's results, because of higher-than-expected revenues and great operating discipline across the businesses."
Sullivan noted that gross margins reached record levels during the quarter, and that the company's 27 percent Return on Invested Capital(2) also represented a new high. "During the quarter, we also brought Verigy to market via an initial public offering, and preparations for a fiscal year-end spinoff of Verigy are on schedule."
Sullivan added, "While remaining vigilant about the economic environment, Agilent's focus going forward is to leverage the robust operating model we've built through higher sustainable growth."
Looking ahead, Agilent (including Verigy) expects fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenues of $1.48 billion to $1.53 billion, up 5 to 9 percent from last year. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.55 per share(3), nearly double last year's comparable earnings.

(1) Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted net income is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, retirement plan curtailment gains, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2) Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(3) Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q406 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter.
(4) Historical segment data have been restated to correspond to current presentation.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things,  the impact of the sale of our businesses and investments from the results of the sales of our products. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services).  These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
Our management recognizes that items such as restructuring charges and sales of investments can have a material impact on our cash flows and net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
The preliminary adjusted net income and EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

Historical amounts were reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
