Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
             
On October 31, 2006, Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("Agilent") completed the spin-off of Verigy Ltd.  ("Verigy") by distributing (the "Distribution") Agilent's remaining equity interest in Verigy to Agilent shareholders.  Verigy is comprised of the former semiconductor test solutions business of Agilent.  Attached as to this Form 8-K is the press release issued by Agilent on October 31, 2006 announcing the completion of the Distribution.
Exhibit 99.1
In the Distribution, Agilent distributed to its stockholders .122435 of an ordinary share of Verigy for each outstanding share of Agilent common stock owned as of 5 pm Eastern time on October 16, 2006.  In the aggregate, Agilent distributed 50 million Verigy ordinary shares to Agilent shareholders.  Based on the closing price for Verigy ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on October 31, 2006 of $16.80 per share, the aggregate market value at the time of the Distribution of the shares distributed in the Distribution was approximately $840 million.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Verigy completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of approximately 8.7 million of its ordinary shares at a price of $15 per share for total net proceeds of $121 million.  Following the offering, approximately 15% of the total ordinary shares of Verigy was held by the public and 85% was held by Agilent. Until the date of the Distribution, as a majority-owned subsidiary, Verigy's results of operations and financial position were consolidated into Agilent's consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the Distribution, Agilent no longer owns an equity interest in Verigy and, therefore, Verigy no longer constitutes part of Agilent's business operations. Accordingly, after the Distribution, the related operating results and financial position of Verigy will be reflected in Agilent's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
Effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Agilent's consolidated financial statements will reflect the financial results of Verigy collapsed into a single line item in the statement of operations titled "Discontinued Operations".

"Completing this distribution marks a major milestone for both Agilent and Verigy," said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and CEO.
