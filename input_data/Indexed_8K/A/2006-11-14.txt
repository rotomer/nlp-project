We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.

It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1

Included in GAAP income from continuing operations are $47 million of charges related principally to the spin-off of Verigy and the reduction of Agilent's infrastructure costs, and $21 million of non-cash compensation charges. Excluding these items and $9 million of tax and other net gains, Agilent reported fourth quarter adjusted net income from continuing operations of $191 million, or $0.46 per share.

"The distribution of Verigy shares to our owners completes a transformative year for Agilent," said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. "As a pure-play measurement company, we finished fiscal 2006 with strong operating results and good momentum." In Q4, orders were up 7 percent from one year ago, revenues were up 6 percent, and adjusted net income per share from continuing operations, at $0.46 per share, was 59 percent above last year's results.

(1) Adjusted net income from continuing operations, adjusted net income from continuing operations per share, and adjusted net income are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. Adjusted net income from continuing operations excludes the impact of discontinued operations, including Verigy, and adjusted net income includes the impact of Verigy. A reconciliation between adjusted net income from continuing operations, adjusted

net income, and GAAP net income from continuing operations is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2) Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(3) Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q107 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter.
(4) Historical segment data have been restated to correspond to current presentation.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things,  the impact of the sale of our businesses and investments from the results of the sales of our products. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services).  These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as restructuring charges and sales of investments can have a material impact on our cash flows and net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary adjusted net income and EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end
balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)    New Agilent return is equal to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $191 million minus net interest income after tax of $22 million. Please see the table on page 5 for a reconciliation of adjusted net income from continuing operations to GAAP income from continuing operations.
(b)   Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(c)   Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Historical amounts were reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
