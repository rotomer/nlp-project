Under his leadership, this segment has doubled in size during the last five years to become a $2 billion business with an excellent Return on Invested Capital.

His legacy will be felt here for many years to come."
"I leave Agilent with a great sense of accomplishment," said van Ingen.  "The past few years have been very exciting ones for us, with ongoing success in our current markets as well as the pursuit of opportunities in new areas.  I look forward to watching as the next chapter in this segment unfolds."
