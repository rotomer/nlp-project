Margin Maintenance
            
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a "Margin Deficit"), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer ("Additional Purchased Securities"), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
          
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a "Margin Excess"), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
          
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party
(c)
          
receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
          
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
(e)
          
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any of all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
           
 
5.
Income Payments
            
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
Security Interest
            
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
Payment and Transfer
            
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
 
8.
Segregation of Purchased Securities
            
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the
purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they will be subject to liens granted by Seller to its clearing bank and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled. Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy the clearing lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
9.
Substitution
            
 
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
          
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; , that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
          
provided, however
 
10.

In the event that (i) a Securities Offering or any other offering of securities contemplated under Section 4(d) hereof shall not have been commenced, or credit facilities contemplated under Section 4(d) hereof shall not have been entered into, in each case, by the Securities Offering Commencement Date, (ii) proceeds in an amount necessary to repurchase the Target Purchased Securities or the Relevant Portion thereof, as the case may be, shall not have been drawn under, or obtained from, the Refinancing by the Related Agreement Accelerated Repurchase Date or (iii) a No Refinancing Notice shall have been provided by Agilent or World Trade to Merrill Lynch and (x) the Target Purchased Securities (in the case of a No Refinancing Notice making the statements described in clause (i) of Section 2(c)) or (y) the Target Securities other than the Relevant Portion (in the case of a No Refinancing Notice making the statements described in clause (ii) of Section 2(c)) shall not have been repurchased on the Related Agreement Accelerated Repurchase Date by World Trade (the events described in (i), (ii) or (iii) each being a ""), Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree (subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section 4(e)) to pay Merrill Lynch, on the date occurring 180 days after the date on which a Repurchase Default shall have occurred and on the last day of each subsequent 180-day period, in which case the date of payment shall be the date occurring 10 days following the date of such cure, with no Additional Financing Fee (as defined below) accruing during such 10-day period), the amount (the "") that shall have accrued during the relevant 180-day period (or such shorter period, as the

The daily amount of the Additional Financing Fee with respect to the Target Purchased Securities or the Relevant Portion thereof or the portion of the Target Purchased Securities other than the Relevant Portion, as the case may be (the "") shall be calculated by dividing the Additional Financing Rate in effect for such day by 365 (or 366, in the case of a calculation made with respect to a leap year) and multiplying the result by such Purchase Price. The amount of Additional Financing Fee on the Purchased Securities for each 180-day period (or shorter period, as the case may be) shall be calculated by adding the Daily Additional Financing Fees for each day in such period. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations shall be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or 0.09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or 0.0987655)) and all United States dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards). Additional Financing Fees shall be paid with immediately available funds on the due date therefor. The parties hereto agree that the amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(e) constitute liquidated damages and are the sole remedy available to Merrill Lynch with respect to the failure, if any, of Agilent and/or World Trade to commence a Refinancing within 120 days following the Notice Date or consummate such Refinancing within 180 days following the Notice Date. If any payment shall be required by the terms hereof to be made on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the immediately succeeding Business Day and no further Additional Financing shall accrue after the day on which payment was required. Without limiting any other applicable cure of a Repurchase Default, upon the consummation of the repurchase of the Target Purchased Securities or the Relevant Portion thereof, as the case may be, a Repurchase Default shall be deemed cured.

Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that for the purposes of this paragraph the relative benefits to World Trade and Agilent, on the one hand, and to Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion that the total value received or contemplated to be received by World Trade and/or Agilent in any Refinancing bears to the fees paid or to be paid to Merrill Lynch under any commitment letter or engagement letter, as the case may be, with respect to such Refinancing; , , that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Indemnified Parties be required to contribute in respect of a specific transaction an aggregate amount in excess of the fees actually paid in such transaction to Merrill Lynch.
