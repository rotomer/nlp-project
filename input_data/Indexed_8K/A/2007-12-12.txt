Amendment of Master Repurchase Agreement and Related Agreements.
 
As reported pursuant to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("Agilent") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2006 (the "Original Form 8-K"), on January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. ("World Trade"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the "Original Repurchase Agreement") with Fenway Capital, LLC ("Fenway"), as counterparty in such transaction (Fenway and its successors and assigns in such capacity, the "Counterparty"), pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the "Purchased Securities"), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited ("AT Cayco") is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.  On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute
Ebbets Funding PLC
as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation ("Merrill").
 
On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (as amended, the "Repurchase Agreement") and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill.  On December 7, 2007, World Trade and Agilent entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Related Agreement dated November 16, 2007 (the "Related Agreement"), with Merrill to amend certain rights and obligations of the parties thereunder.  The material terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase from the Counterparty, and the Counterparty is obligated to sell to World Trade, the Purchased Securities at a purchase price equal to 100% of their aggregate liquidation preference on January 27, 2011.  The Repurchase Agreement contains customary events of default for repurchase agreements with respect to each of World Trade and the Counterparty, including failure to pay amounts owed under the Repurchase Agreement, insolvency events (including with respect to Agilent, as guarantor), breaches of representations (including with respect to Agilent, as guarantor) and the failure to provide various notifications required.  Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default thereunder, the non-defaulting party has the right to accelerate, or in the case of the occurrence of an insolvency event, the non-defaulting party will be deemed to have accelerated, the repurchase obligation of World Trade under the Repurchase Agreement.  Under the Repurchase Agreement, World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities to any date prior to January 27, 2011 (an "Accelerated Repurchase Date").
 
Under the Repurchase Agreement and the Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments to the Counterparty, at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to either (i) the cost of funds to the Counterparty plus 20 basis points, or (ii) three-month LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Repurchase Agreement) plus 52 basis points.  World Trade is entitled to receive from the Counterparty
 
from time to time amounts equal to all dividends and other distributions in respect of the Purchased Securities.
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008, Merrill may designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchased Securities (the "Merrill Lynch Notice").  After delivery of the Merrill Lynch Notice, Merrill may designate a repurchase date to occur no earlier than 120 days from the date of such notice.  Further, the parties agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008,
World Trade may designate a repurchase date to occur no earlier than 5 business days from the date of such notice.  However,
if the r
epurchase date
does not fall on a Price Differential Payment Date (as defined in the Related Agreement), World Trade will be required to pay the Counterparty an amount equal to
any breakage costs incurred by Merrill with respect to any commercial paper or three-month LIBOR-based funding allocated to the Repurchase Agreement
.
 
Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc., dated as of November 16, 2007, Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade under the Repurchase Agreement.
 
In addition, Agilent and World Trade entered into the Agilent Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006 (the "Agilent Agreement"), which remains unchanged, in favor of the Counterparty and certain other parties, regarding certain representations, warranties and covenants of Agilent and World Trade with respect to each and with respect to AT Cayco and certain other subsidiaries of Agilent.
 
A copy of the aforementioned agreements (excluding the Agilent Agreement, which was previously filed) are included herein as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. 
The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements.

Initiation; Confirmation; Termination
 
(a)
    
An agreement to enter into a Transaction may be made orally or in writing at the initiation of either Buyer or Seller. On the Purchase Date for the Transaction, the Purchased Securities shall be transferred to Buyer or its agent against the transfer of the Purchase Price to an account of Seller.
 
(b)
    
Upon agreeing to enter into a Transaction hereunder, Buyer or Seller (or both), as shall be agreed, shall promptly deliver to the other party a written confirmation of each Transaction (a "Confirmation").

4.
        
Margin Maintenance
 
(a)
    
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a "Margin Deficit"), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer ("Additional Purchased Securities"), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
 
(b)
    
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a "Margin Excess"),  then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
 
(c)
    
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(d)
    
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
 
(e)
    
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
 
(f)
     
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
 
5.
        
Income Payments
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
        
Security Interest
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
        
Payment and Transfer
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
 
8.
        
Segregation of Purchased Securities
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the
Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they will be subject to liens granted by Seller to its clearing bank and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy the clearing lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
9.
        
Substitution
 
(a)
    
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
 
(b)
    
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; , that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
provided, however
 
10.
      
Representations
 
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, by-law or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected.

11.

(a)
    
The nondefaulting party may, at its option (which option shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency), declare an Event of Default to have occurred hereunder and, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of such option, the Repurchase Date for each Transaction hereunder shall, if it has not already occurred, be deemed immediately to occur (except that, in the event that the Purchase Date for any Transaction has not yet occurred as of the date of such exercise or deemed exercise, such Transaction shall be deemed immediately canceled). The nondefaulting party shall (except upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency) give notice to the defaulting party of the exercise of such option as promptly as practicable.
 
(b)
    
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, if the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, (i) the defaulting party's obligations in such Transactions to repurchase all Purchased Securities, at the Repurchase Price therefor on the Repurchase Date determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, (ii) all Income paid after such exercise or deemed exercise shall be retained by the nondefaulting party and applied to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, and (iii) the defaulting party shall immediately deliver to the nondefaulting party any Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions then in the defaulting party's possession or control.
 
(c)
    
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, upon tender by the nondefaulting party of payment of the aggregate Repurchase Prices for all such Transactions, all right, title and interest in and entitlement to all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions shall be deemed transferred to the nondefaulting party, and the defaulting party shall deliver all such Purchased Securities to the nondefaulting party.
 
(d)
    
If the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, the nondefaulting party, without prior notice to the defaulting party, may:
 
(i)
       
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, (A) immediately sell, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions and apply the proceeds thereof to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of selling all or a portion of such Purchased Securities, to give the defaulting party credit for such Purchased Securities in an amount equal to the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing bid quotation from such a source, against the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder; and
 
(ii)
      
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, (A) immediately purchase, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, securities ("Replacement Securities") of the same class and amount as any Purchased Securities that are not delivered by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party as required hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of purchasing Replacement Securities, to be deemed to have purchased Replacement Securities at the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing offer quotation from such a source.
 
Unless otherwise provided in Annex I, the parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Securities subject to any Transaction hereunder are instruments traded in a recognized market, (2) in the absence of a generally recognized source for prices or bid or offer quotations for any Security, the nondefaulting party may establish the source therefor in its sole discretion and (3) all prices, bids and offers shall be determined together with accrued Income (except to the extent contrary to market practice with respect to the relevant Securities).
(e)
  
As to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for any excess of the price paid (or deemed paid) by the nondefaulting party for Replacement Securities over the Repurchase Price for the Purchased Securities replaced thereby and for any amounts payable by the defaulting party under Paragraph 5 hereof or otherwise hereunder.
 
(f)
   
For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Repurchase Price for each Transaction hereunder in respect of which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer shall not increase above the amount of such Repurchase Price for such Transaction determined as of the date of the exercise or deemed exercise by the nondefaulting party of the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
 
(g)
  
The defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for (i) the amount of all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the nondefaulting party in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, (ii) damages in an amount equal to the cost (including all fees, expenses and commissions) of entering into replacement transactions and entering into or terminating hedge transactions in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, and (iii) any other loss, damage, cost or expense directly arising or resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default in respect of a Transaction.
 
(h)
  
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for interest on any amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, from the date the defaulting party becomes liable for such amounts hereunder until such amounts are (i) paid in full by the defaulting party or (ii) satisfied in full by the exercise of the nondefaulting party's rights hereunder. Interest on any sum payable by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party under this Paragraph 11(h) shall be at a rate equal to the greater of the Pricing Rate for the relevant Transaction or the Prime Rate.
 
(i)
   
The nondefaulting party shall have, in addition to its rights hereunder, any rights otherwise available to it under any other agreement or applicable law.
 
12.
      
Single Agreement
 
Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, and have entered hereinto and will enter into each Transaction hereunder in consideration of and in reliance upon the fact that, all Transactions hereunder constitute a single business and contractual relationship and have been made in consideration of each other. Accordingly, each of Buyer and Seller agrees (i) to perform all of its obligations in respect of each Transaction hereunder, and that a default in the performance of any such obligations shall constitute a default by it in respect of all Transactions hereunder, (ii) that each of them shall be entitled to set off claims and apply property held by them in respect of any Transaction against obligations owing to them in respect of any other Transactions hereunder and (iii) that payments, deliveries and other transfers made by either of them in respect of any Transaction shall be deemed to have been made in consideration of payments, deliveries and other transfers in respect of any other Transactions hereunder, and the obligations to make any such payments, deliveries and other transfers may be applied against each other and netted.

14.
      
Entire Agreement; Severability

Use of Employee Plan Assets
 
(a)
    
If assets of an employee benefit plan subject to any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") are intended to be used by either party hereto (the "Plan Party") in a Transaction, the Plan Party shall so notify the other party prior to the Transaction.

19.
      
Intent
 
(a)
    
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a "repurchase agreement" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a "securities contract" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
 
(b)
    
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(c)
    
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an "insured depository institution," as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended ("FDIA"), then each Transaction hereunder is a "qualified financial contract", as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
 
(d)
    
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a "netting contract" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a "covered contractual payment entitlement" or "covered contractual payment obligation", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a "financial institution" as that term is defined in FDICIA).
 
20.
      
Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections
 
The parties acknowledge that they have been advised that:
 
(a)
    
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("1934 Act"), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 ("SIPA") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
(b)
    
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
 
(c)
    
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

Guaranteed Obligations
 
This agreement amends and restates in its entirety as of the date hereof the Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc. dated September 10, 2007 in favor of Ebbets Funding PLC.
 
The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Counterparty with respect thereto.  The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of World Trade under or in respect of the Repo Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against World Trade or whether World Trade is joined in any such action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
 
(a)           any lack of validity or enforceability of the Repo Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;
(b)           any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Repo Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise;

(e)           any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Counterparty that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, World Trade or the Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.
 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Counterparty or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of World Trade or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Counterparty exhaust any right or take any action against World Trade or any other Person or any Purchased Securities.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Counterparty that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Guarantor or other rights of the Guarantor to proceed against World Trade and (ii) any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against World Trade unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash.  If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Counterparty, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Counterparty in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement.  If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Counterparty of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, the Counterparty will, at the Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.
 
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Counterparty and its successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns.  Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Counterparty may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Repo Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Counterparty herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in the Repo Agreement.  The Guarantor shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Counterparty.
 
This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be executed in its corporate name by its duly authorized representative on and as of November 16, 2007.

Repo Agreement, the Agilent Guarantee and the
Purchased Securities and the proceeds thereof, (ii) 
the transfer of any rights or obligations of Counterparty under the Repo Agreement to Merrill Lynch or any of its affiliates pursuant to paragraph 15(a) of the Repo Agreement, as amended by Annex I thereto, does not require the prior consent of World Trade, and (iii) Counterparty and Merrill Lynch have agreed that
in the event
the Liquidity Arrangement is terminated in whole or in part and the transferee of the
Repo Agreement, the Agilent Guarantee and the
Purchased Securities
is designated to be Merrill Lynch or any of Merrill Lynch's affiliates (the "") to whom the transfer of rights and obligations under the

all of Counterparty's right, title and interest in the
Repo Agreement, the Agilent Guarantee and the
Purchased Securities
on the date on which
Counterparty receives the tender in cash of all amounts required to be paid to Counterparty as a result of such termination pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Arrangement.

In the event that Agilent or World Trade so instructs Merrill Lynch in writing and upon (x) the fulfillment of the requisite conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of Subsection 2(f)(ii) of the Custody Agreement and (y) the designation in writing by Agilent or World Trade to Merrill Lynch of the information required to be provided by Merrill Lynch in the instructions described in clause (C) of such Subsection 2(f)(ii), Merrill Lynch shall deliver an Merrill Lynch Repurchase Notice (as defined in the Custody Agreement) and a related share transfer form, in each case, in conformity with the foregoing instructions, to The Bank of New York (or any replacement custodian under the Custody Agreement) pursuant to Subsection 2(f)(ii) of the Custody Agreement.
 
In addition, Merrill Lynch agrees not to cause, permit or consent to any amendment to or modification of Section 2(e) or (f) of the Custody Agreement without the written consent of Agilent or World Trade (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
 
4.             .  Each of Agilent, World Trade and Merrill Lynch agrees that any and all expenses incurred by Merrill Lynch pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Custody Agreement shall be promptly reimbursed by Agilent upon presentation by Merrill Lynch of an itemized accounting thereof.

Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless Merrill Lynch and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (Merrill Lynch and each such other person being an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint or several, to which such Indemnified Party becomes subject under any applicable law, or otherwise related to or arising out of or in connection with (a) any transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (b) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any information (whether oral or written) or documents furnished or made available by World Trade or Agilent or any of their affiliates in connection with any transaction contemplated pursuant to this Agreement or the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they were made; , , that neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable, in the case of this clause (b), to the extent that any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based on such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to Merrill Lynch (or the relevant affiliate thereof) furnished to Agilent or World Trade by Merrill Lynch expressly for use therein.  In no event shall Agilent or World Trade be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.  Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree to promptly reimburse any Indemnified Party for all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising from any of the matters referred to in the preceding sentence, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party and whether or not such claim, action or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf of World Trade or Agilent or the relevant issuer or whether or not resulting in any liability.  Neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Agilent and World Trade jointly or severally agree to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Agilent and World Trade further jointly and severally agree not to assert any claim against any Indemnified Party for consequential, punitive or exemplary damages on any theory of liability in connection with the transactions described in or contemplated by this Agreement.  Neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable to an Indemnified Party under clause (a) of the foregoing indemnification provision to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted primarily from such Indemnified Party's bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Indemnification; Contribution
provided
however
 
If the indemnification of an Indemnified Party provided for in this Agreement is for any reason held unenforceable, Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree to contribute to the losses, claims, damages or liabilities for which such indemnification is held unenforceable (a) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits to World Trade and Agilent, on the one hand, and Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, of the relevant transaction contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, or (b) (but only if) the allocation provided for in clause (a) is for any reason prohibited by law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (a) but also World Trade and Agilent's relative
fault, on the one hand, and the relative fault of Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that for the purposes of this paragraph the relative benefits to World Trade and Agilent, on the one hand, and to Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion that the total value received or contemplated to be received by World Trade and/or Agilent in any transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement bears to the fees paid or to be paid to Merrill Lynch with respect to such transaction; , , that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Indemnified Parties be required to contribute in respect of a specific transaction an aggregate amount in excess of the fees actually paid in such transaction to Merrill Lynch.  The foregoing contribution agreement shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Party may have at common law or otherwise.  No investigation or failure to investigate by any Indemnified Party shall impair the foregoing indemnification and contribution agreement or any other right an Indemnified Party may have.
provided
however
 
Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that, without Merrill Lynch's prior written consent, neither World Trade nor Agilent nor any of their affiliates or subsidiaries will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification has been or could be sought under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement (whether or not Merrill Lynch or any other Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (a) includes an unconditional written release, in form and substance satisfactory to Merrill Lynch and each Indemnified Party, from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.
 
In the event that an Indemnified Party is requested or required to appear as a witness in any action brought by or on behalf of or against Agilent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in which such Indemnified Party is not named as a defendant, World Trade and Agilent agree to reimburse such Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with such Indemnified Party's appearing and preparing to appear as such a witness, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of its legal counsel.

); provided that if (i) Belmont Funding LLC ceases to fund substantially all of its assets through the issuance of
Unaffiliated Funding Instruments or (ii) the aggregate notional amount under total return swaps between Merrill Lynch and Belmont Funding LLC relating to assets held by Belmont Funding LLC falls below USD 1,000,000,000, then the Belmont Rate shall thereafter be LIBOR (irrespective of any subsequent changes in Belmont Funding LLC's funding sources or the notional amount under such total return swaps).

(b)           Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that, in the event the Liquidity Arrangement is terminated for any reason other than the occurrence of a Voluntary MLCS Event or an Event of Default (within the meaning of the LA Confirmation) for which Merrill Lynch is the defaulting party, Agilent and World Trade shall jointly and severally pay to Merrill Lynch or to an affiliate thereof designated by Merrill Lynch an amount equal to the MLCS Breakage Amount (as defined for purposes of the LA Confirmation and notified to Agilent and World Trade by Merrill Lynch) no later than the second Business Day following the date on which Merrill Lynch notifies Agilent and World Trade of such MLCS Breakage Amount, and Merrill Lynch shall pay to World Trade the Counterparty Breakage Amount (as defined for purposes of the LA Confirmation) no later than the second Business Day following the date on which Merrill Lynch receives such amount.
