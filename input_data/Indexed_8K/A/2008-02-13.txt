We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 13, 2008  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.40 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2008, 12 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.39 billion, 9 percent above last year. First quarter GAAP net income was $120 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. Last year's first quarter GAAP net income was $150 million, or $0.36 per share.
 
Included in this quarter's GAAP income is $30 million of share-based compensation expense. Excluding this item and $10 million of other net adjustments, Agilent reported first quarter adjusted net income of $160 million, or $0.42 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $162 million, or $0.39 per share, one year ago.

"Agilent had a good fiscal first quarter, with performance that was very much in line with our expectations," said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. "Revenues of $1.39 billion were up 9 percent from last year, near the high end of guidance.
 
"Bio-Analytical markets showed sustained momentum, with segment orders up 20 percent and revenues up 15 percent, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit segment growth. Demand remains robust in both life sciences and chemical analysis markets, and across all geographies.
 
"While Electronic Measurement markets remain mixed, we did see some overall improvement compared to prior quarters, with better balance between general purpose and communications markets, and across geographic regions. Segment orders were up 8 percent while revenues were 5 percent ahead of last year.
 
"First quarter adjusted net income per share, at $0.42, was also near the top of our $0.38 - $0.43 guidance range."
 
 was 23 percent, equal to last year's record first quarter, despite the addition of nearly $390 million of acquisitions. Inventory Days-On-Hand was improved by 3 days from one year ago. During the period, the company repurchased $237 million of its common stock.

  For the fiscal second quarter of 2008, revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion, up 6 percent to 10 percent from last year. Second quarter adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50 per share, 7 percent to 16 percent above last year's comparable earnings.
Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2008, Sullivan said the company had anticipated some slowing, mainly in U.S. markets, and had planned the year conservatively as a result. Given current trends, Sullivan said the company was still comfortable with the range of analyst estimates for FY2008 revenues and adjusted net income per share.

 Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash share-based compensation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(1)
 
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 5 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2)
 
 Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q208 and full year 2008 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $13 million per quarter.

Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 include pre-tax share-based compensation expense under SFAS No. 123(R) of $30 million and $36 million, respectively, related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases.

The preliminary cash flow statement is estimated based on our current information.
 
We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, expenses related to share-based compensation, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
Agilent return is equal to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $160 million minus net interest income after tax of $7 million.  Please see "Adjusted Net Income and EPS Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of adjusted net income from continuing operations to GAAP income from continuing operations.
(a)
 
Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
(b)
 
Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
(c)
 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria. We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments. We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company. We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
