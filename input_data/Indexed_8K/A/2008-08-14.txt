We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 14, 2008  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.39 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2008, 6 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.44 billion, 5 percent above last year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $169 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter GAAP net income was $185 million, or $0.45 per share.
 
Included in this quarter's GAAP income is $22 million of non-cash amortization charges. Excluding this item and $7 million of other net charges,
 
 
Agilent reported third quarter adjusted net income of $198 million, or $0.53 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $173 million, or $0.43 per share, one year ago.

"The power of Agilent's operating model was clearly evident during the quarter," said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. "Economic conditions were difficult in much of the developed world, and third quarter revenues came in at the low end of our expectations. But we were able to quickly adapt to the changing economic environment, and our adjusted net income came in just above the high end of our expectations."
 
Third quarter adjusted net income of $0.53 per share was 23 percent above one year ago compared with a 5 percent increase in revenues. Subtracting $18 million of share-based compensation from operating results, third quarter adjusted net income of $0.57 per share compares with guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.
 
Organic revenue growth in the Americas was about 3 percent, and local currency revenues were about flat in Europe compared with last year. Growth in Asia Pacific, at about 2 percent, was less robust than in recent quarters due largely to weakness in Japan.
 
Segment trends were very similar to the first half, with Bio-Analytical revenues up 13 percent, or 10 percent excluding acquisitions, with robust growth in both life sciences and chemical analysis markets. Electronic Measurement revenues increased less than 1 percent, with steady growth in communications test markets largely offset by weakness in semiconductor-related markets.
 
 was a record 27 percent, three points above last year. Inventory Days-On-Hand improved by four days from one year ago, and Receivables Days Sales Outstanding improved by one day. Cash generated from operations during the quarter was $169 million. During the period, the company repurchased $250 million of its common stock and paid $41 million for acquisitions.

Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Sullivan said the company's outlook remained cautious but relatively unchanged. "We anticipate tough conditions in much of the developed world and slowing, though still robust, growth in developing Asian markets."
 
Given these trends, Sullivan said the company expected fiscal fourth quarter revenues in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.58 billion, up 5 percent to 9 percent from last year. Fourth quarter adjusted net income, including share-based compensation, is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share, 26 percent to 35 percent above one year ago, and unchanged from prior guidance.

For the fiscal first quarter of 2009, Sullivan emphasized that visibility was poor given volatile economic conditions, and that the company would continue to plan conservatively. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.50 billion, up 4 percent to 8 percent from one year earlier. First quarter adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.44 per share, 11 percent to 22 percent above the prior year's comparable earnings.

Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement orders were up 19 percent during the third quarter from one year ago, the ninth consecutive double-digit advance, and up 15 percent excluding the impact of the Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions. Revenues of $566 million were up 13 percent from last year, and up 10 percent excluding the two acquisitions. Revenues were up double-digit percentages in both
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis. Geographically, revenues were up 15 percent in the Americas, 5 percent in Europe, and 23 percent in Asia.
 
Life Sciences revenues of $247 million were up 18 percent from one year ago, and up 11 percent excluding acquisitions. Pharma and Biotech markets were up 14 percent, with modest growth in the Americas and Europe and a strong performance from Asia. Sales to the academic and government markets were 36 percent above one year ago, with particular strength in microarrays, which were up nearly 50 percent. Chemical Analysis revenues of $319 million were up 10 percent from last year, with weakness in semiconductor-related materials science markets tempering what otherwise would have been 13 percent growth in Chemical Analysis revenues. Demand from petrochemicals was very strong, up 24 percent, and food safety was 17 percent ahead of one year ago.
 
 dropped one point to 25 percent due to acquisition-related costs and increased invested capital.
Third quarter segment income from operations of $101 million was $19 million above last year on a $66 million increase in revenues. Adjusting for the impact of the Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions, the segment generated a $22 million improvement in income on a $48 million increase in revenues. Operating margins of 18 percent were improved about one point from last year due to an equivalent increase in gross margin. Segment Return On Invested Capital

Electronic Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Third quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $793 million were 2 percent below last year. Revenues of $878 million were up less than 1 percent, with the Americas flat, Europe up 15 percent and Asia down 5 percent from one year ago
 
because of weakness in Japan. General Purpose Test revenues were down 5 percent from last year because of a nearly 50 percent decline in the semiconductor-related parametric test business. Communications Test revenues were up 9 percent, with strength in R&D markets for LTE and broadband applications, and a continuing rebound in handset manufacturing test.
 
 to improve four points to 27 percent.
Third quarter segment income from operations of $135 million was up $19 million from last year on a $4 million increase in revenues. Gross margins were about unchanged from last year, but tight control of operating expenses produced an operating margin of 15 percent, two points above one year ago. Higher profitability and aggressive asset management enabled segment ROIC

 Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(1)
 
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2)
 
 Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q408 and Q109 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges and non-cash amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $13 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end
balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
