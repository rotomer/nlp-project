(the "Company") issued its press release announcing financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2009.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Highlights:
 
                 
GAAP net loss of $101 million, or ($0.29) per share
                 
Non-GAAP earnings of $44 million, or $0.13 per share
(1)
                 
Positive operating cash flow of $137 million in quarter
                 
Revenue of $1.09 billion, down 25 percent from last year, orders down 33 percent from one year earlier
                 
Restructuring actions on track to achieve $525 million of annualized savings by mid-2010
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 14, 2009  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenues of $1.09 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2009, 25 percent below one year ago. Second quarter GAAP net loss was $101 million, or ($0.29) per diluted share. Last year's second quarter GAAP net income was $173 million, or $0.47 per share.
During the second quarter, Agilent had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $98 million, and $12 million of non-cash amortization.  It also recognized a quarter-to-date tax adjustment of $31 million, and had $4 million of other net charges. Excluding these items, Agilent reported second quarter adjusted net income of $44 million, or $0.13 per share.  On a comparable basis, the company earned $172 million, or $0.46 per share, one year ago.
 
"In the second quarter, Agilent continued to deal aggressively with the effects of the severe global economic downturn," said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. "Total revenues of $1.09 billion were 25 percent below last year despite the relative outperformance of our Bio-Analytical Segment, which was off 6 percent.
 
"The global collapse of electronics production caused severe declines in our Electronic Measurement and Semiconductor & Board Test segments, where revenues were off by 33 percent and 63 percent, respectively, from one year ago.  As previously announced, we are moving very quickly to restructure these businesses to achieve double-digit profitability even at these severely depressed activity levels."
 
Second quarter Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
fell to 8 percent compared to 24 percent one year ago because of lower earnings. Net working capital was reduced by $228 million from last year, and cash generated from operations during the second quarter was $137 million.  The company ended the quarter with net cash of $922 million.
 
Looking ahead, Sullivan noted that there are some tentative signs that the global downturn may be nearing a trough.  Said Sullivan, "If these early signals of a bottoming in global electronics markets continue, we could anticipate a bottoming in our electronic measurement business in the next few months.  There are also some indications that bio-analytical markets could begin to benefit from the global stimulus packages by year-end.  Based on these indicators, we would expect full year fiscal 2009 revenues to be down roughly 25 percent from 2008."
"Our restructuring of corporate infrastructure and the businesses is on track to achieve $525 million of annualized savings by mid-FY2010.  Regardless of the economic environment, our commitment is to remain cash-flow positive, to keep employees focused on customers, products and technologies, and to deliver performance consistent with Agilent's operating model."
 
Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Considering the very difficult macroeconomic environment, Bio-Analytical Measurement performed well in the second quarter.  Orders of $481 million were down 16 percent from one year earlier, while revenues of $498 million were off 6 percent from last year.  During the quarter, Chemical Analysis was down 6 percent while Life Sciences revenues were off 7 percent.
 
Geographically, weakness was most pronounced in Europe, which was off 16 percent from last year, while revenue in the Americas was off 10 percent.  Asia remained an area of strength, with Japan up 7 percent from last year and other Asia up 12 percent.  China was particularly robust, up 29 percent from one year ago.  By product platform, Gas (GC) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) were both weak, offsetting continued strength in GC / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), LC/MS and microarrays.
 
Life Sciences revenues of $241 million were down 7 percent in the second quarter from one year ago.  Spending by Pharma and Biotech customers was down 11 percent, with a lengthening of the replacement cycle in the current soft environment and funding pressures impacting smaller biotech firms.  Sales to the academic and government markets continued strong, 10 percent above one year ago, with robust demand in Mass Spec systems as well as for microarrays.
Chemical Analysis revenues of $257 million were down 6 percent from last year.  Food safety continued its strong momentum and was up 30 percent from one year ago, while weakness was seen across most industrial markets.  From a platform perspective, demand remained weak for GCs and relatively strong for GC/MS and LC/MS systems.
 
Second quarter segment income from operations of $89 million was $4 million above last year's results despite a $32 million decline in revenues. Gross margins were up 1  points from last year, while operating margins, at 18 percent, were two points above one year ago.  Segment Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
improved 2 points to 24 percent.
 
Electronic Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Second quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $523 million were 39 percent below last year, while revenues of $558 million were off 33 percent from one year ago.  Market weakness was pervasive, with General Purpose revenues down 28 percent and Communications 39 percent below one year ago. Geographically, Europe declined 30 percent, Japan was off 43 percent, other Asia dropped 32 percent and the Americas was 31 percent below last year.
 
General Purpose revenues of $336 million were down 28 percent from last year.  Aerospace / defense showed relative strength, down 2 percent and with signs of stabilization of U.S. demand.  Other general purpose markets were off 41
percent from last year due to extreme weakness in electronics manufacturing and computer / semiconductor markets.  Communications revenues of $222 million were down 39 percent from one year ago.  Wireless R&D showed relative strength, down 17 percent from last year and up 15 percent sequentially.  Other communications markets were down well over 20 percent from one year ago.
 
Second quarter segment profit declined $126 million from last year to an operating loss of $6 million based on a $273 million decline in revenues.  Gross margins fell by 7 points from last year due to lower volume, while operating expenses were $74 million below last year.  Operating margins fell 15 points to (1) percent. Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 29 points to (1) percent, driven by lower profitability and despite $87 million lower invested capital.
 
As announced previously, Agilent has begun a program to reduce the operating breakeven of the Electronic Measurement segment by $300 million.  The program, designed to achieve a 12 percent operating margin and 21 percent ROIC
(2)
 at an annual revenue of $2.3 billion, is on track to be completed by mid-FY2010.
 
Semiconductor & Board Test
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
The company earlier this quarter announced an additional restructuring of the Semiconductor & Board Test segment to address the severe decline in business conditions, which continued through the second quarter of 2009.
 
Segment orders of $22 million were down 75 percent from last year as customer capital spending in all markets and geographies remains frozen. Revenues of $35 million were off 63 percent from one year ago. All geographies and product lines were off more than 50 percent from one year ago.
Second quarter segment loss from operations of $16 million represents a deterioration of $24 million from last year's results on a $60 million decline in revenues.  Gross margins fell 25 points due to the drop in volume, while operating expenses declined by $15 million from last year. Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 23 points to (15) percent.

Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products and technologies, the risk of additional costs and delays associated with compliance with U.S. and international labor and other laws associated with our planned restructuring activities, the risk that a further decline in general economic conditions and the global credit and equity markets will require changes to the planned restructuring, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from the restructuring activities.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter year ended January 31, 2009. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.
 
 
(1)
 
Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end
balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)
 Agilent return is equal to adjusted net income from operations of $44 million plus net interest expense after tax of $13 million.
Please see "Adjusted Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of adjusted net income from operations to GAAP income from operations.
(b)
 Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
(c)
 Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
