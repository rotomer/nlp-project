Item 8.01.              Other Events
 
On November 19, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") approved a new share repurchase program (the "New Share Repurchase Program"), authorizing the Company to repurchase its common stock to reduce or eliminate dilution in connection with issuances of stock under the Company's equity incentive plans.  Repurchases under the New Share Repurchase Program will be implemented using a variety of methods, which may include open-market purchases, block trades, accelerated share-repurchase transactions or otherwise, or by any combination of such methods.  The New Share Repurchase Program does not require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.  The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases will depend on factors such as the stock price, economic and market conditions, and corporate and regulatory requirements.  There is no fixed termination date for the New Share Repurchase Program.
 
On November 15, 2009, the Company's share repurchase program, which was approved on November 15, 2007, expired upon the termination of its two-year term.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
