Item 8.01.              Other Events
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("Agilent") will report results in three separate business segments comprised of the electronic measurement segment, the life sciences segment and the chemical analysis segment.  This Form 8-K provides information on this change in segment reporting and a summary of the effects of this change on Agilent's historical segment results. The change in segment reporting will be reflected retrospectively, but in no way revises or restates the GAAP Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period.
 
The life sciences and chemical analysis segments will be formed from the existing bio-analytical measurement segment.  The electronic measurement segment will recombine our existing electronic measurement and semiconductor board test segments, which were reported separately in fiscal 2009.  The three new operating segments were determined based primarily on how Agilent's chief operating decision maker views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Other factors, including technology and delivery channels, consumer-specific solutions and specialized manufacturing, were considered in determining the formation of these new operating segments.
 
The life sciences segment will include DNA microarrays and associated scanner, software, and reagents; microfluidics-based sample analysis systems; liquid chromatography systems, columns and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems; capillary electrophoresis systems; laboratory software and informatics systems; bio-reagents and related products; laboratory automation and robotic systems; services and support for the aforementioned products.
 
The chemical analysis segment will include gas chromatography systems, columns and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry products; spectroscopy analyzers; software and data systems; services and support for the aforementioned products.
 
The electronic measurement segment will now include the semiconductor board test segment by recombining laser interferometer, parametric test and printed circuit board manufacturing test equipment.
 
These changes were effective as of November 1, 2009. All segment financial information, beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2010, will reflect this change. This change will be reflected on a retrospective basis, with prior years also adjusted to reflect the change in segments. Agilent is issuing this Form 8-K in order to provide investors with summary financial information and historical data that is on a basis consistent with its new reporting structure.  Exhibit 99.1 provides quarterly financial summary information by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009.
Item 9.01.              Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).

In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)
 Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(b)
 Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Historical amounts were reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
