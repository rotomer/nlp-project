Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On May 14, 2010, pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") among Agilent Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Agilent"), Cobalt Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent ("Merger Sub"), and Varian, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Varian"), Agilent completed its acquisition of Varian via the merger of Merger Sub with and into Varian, with Varian continuing as the surviving company in the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent (the "Merger").
 
At the effective time and as a result of the Merger, each share of common stock of Varian issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than shares held by any Varian stockholders who properly exercised statutory appraisal rights and shares owned by Varian as treasury stock or by any subsidiary of Varian, was automatically converted into the right to receive $52.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. Varian's unvested restricted stock units and performance shares were also paid out at $52 per share and Varian's in the money stock options were paid out at $52 per share less the applicable exercise price, in all cases without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $1.5 billion.
