Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 13, 2010, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement with Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, on behalf of the several underwriters named therein, in connection with the offer and sale of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes") and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes" and, together with the 2013 Notes, the "Notes") in an underwritten public offering (the "Offering").  The offering is expected to be completed on July 20, 2010.  The underwriting agreement contains customary representations and covenants and includes the terms and conditions of the sale of the Notes, indemnification and contribution obligations and other terms and conditions customary in agreements of this type.
 
Upon completion of the Offering, the Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 24, 2007, (the "Indenture") between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and, in connection with the 2013 Notes, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of July 20, 2010, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), and, in connection with the 2020 Notes, the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, to be dated as of July 20, 2010, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture") with the following principal terms.
 
The 2013 Notes and 2020 Notes will be issued at a price to the public of 99.815% and 99.535%, respectively, of their principal amount.  The 2013 Notes and 2020 Notes will (a) mature on July 15, 2013 and July 15, 2020, respectively and (b) bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.50% and 5.00%, respectively, per annum, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2011. The Notes are unsecured and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other senior unsecured indebtedness.
 
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part at any time, at the Company's option, at a  redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the date of redemption: (a) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments thereon discounted to the date of redemption, on a semi-annual basis, at the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Fourth Supplemental Indenture or the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, as applicable) plus 25 basis points for the 2013 Notes and 30 basis points for the 2020 Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Fourth Supplemental Indenture or the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, as applicable) of the Company that results in a decrease of the ratings of the 2013 Notes and/or the 2020 Notes by one of Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch"), Moody's Investors Service Inc. (Moody's) or Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P"), such that the applicable Notes are rated below investment grade by each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
 
The Indenture will contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness, and to enter into sale and lease-back transactions, subject to certain exceptions.
 
The Notes will be subject to customary events of default, including: (a) the Company's failure to pay principal or premium, if any, on the Notes when due at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (b) the Company's failure to pay interest for 30 days after the interest becomes due and payable; (c) the Company's failure to repurchase Notes tendered for repurchase following the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined in the Fourth Supplemental Indenture or the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, as applicable); (d) the Company's failure to perform, or its breach of, any other covenant or warranty in the Indenture for 90 days after either the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have given the Company written notice of the default or breach in the manner required by the Indenture; (e) specified events involving the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization; and (f) (1) a failure to make any payment at maturity, including any applicable grace period, on any indebtedness of the Company (other than indebtedness of the Company owing to any of its subsidiaries) outstanding in an amount in excess of $100 million and continuance of this failure to pay or (2) a default on any indebtedness of the Company (other than indebtedness owing to any of its subsidiaries), which default results in the acceleration of such indebtedness in an amount in excess of $100 million without such indebtedness having been discharged or the acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, in the case of clause (1) or (2) above.
 
The descriptions above are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the Indenture, filed as Exhibit 4.01 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on October 24, 2007 (File No. 333-146892) and the underwriting agreement, the form of Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the form of Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the form of 2013 Notes and the form of 2020 Notes, filed as Exhibit Nos. 1.01, 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 and 4.04 hereto, respectively, and, in each case, incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
The information set forth above under Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
 
 
On July 13, 2010, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. Under the interest rate swaps the Company will receive fixed-rate interest payments and will make payments based on the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 174 basis points with respect to the 2020 Notes. The economic effect of these swaps will be to convert the fixed-rate interest expense on the 2020 Notes to a variable LIBOR-based interest rate.

Indemnification and Contribution
Indemnification of the Underwriters
 
(b)           .  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following:  the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus and the information contained in the sixth paragraph relating to stabilization under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Company
 
(c)           .  If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may

designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
 
(d)           .  If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in
Contribution
connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e)           .  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
 
(f)            .  The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
 
8.             .  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
 
9.             .

Termination
10.           .  (a)  If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement.  If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms.  If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
 
(b)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
 
(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters.  Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
 
(d)           Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
 
11.           .  (a)  Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the

12.           .  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.
