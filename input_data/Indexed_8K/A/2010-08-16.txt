(the "Company") issued its press release announcing financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2010.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between non-GAAP earnings and GAAP net earnings is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)
 Revenues, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, are a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impacts of the Varian acquisition and the divestitures of our Network Systems and Hycor businesses. A reconciliation between non-GAAP revenues, and GAAP revenues is set forth on page 9 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(3)
 Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q410 and full fiscal year 2010 excludes primarily the impacts of integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $31 million per quarter.
 
(4)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 7 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(5)
 Net Cash is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as (A) the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents, (2) restricted cash and cash equivalents and (3) investments  debt securities less (B) the sum of (1) short-term debt, (2) long-term debt and (3)
senior notes. The reconciliation of Net Cash can be found on page 10 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results "through the eyes" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Income (loss) from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income (loss) from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses.
 
In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)
   Agilent return is equal to non-GAAP net income from operations of $191 million plus net interest expense after tax of $17 million for Q3'10, and $53 million plus net interest expense after tax of $13 million for Q3'09. Please see "Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income from operations to GAAP income (loss) from operations.
(b)
   Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
(c)
   Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Revenue, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, is a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impacts of the Varian acquisition and the divestitures of our Network Systems and Hycor businesses.
 
Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by reflecting an additional way of viewing aspects of Agilent's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We excluded the effect of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures because the nature, size and number of these can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
 
 
 
The preliminary reconciliation of net cash is estimated based on our current information.
 
Management believes this metric provides useful information to investors about the Company's overall liquidity and financial position.  Net Cash is a measure at a point in time and does not reflect the Company's future financial prospects or liquidity.
