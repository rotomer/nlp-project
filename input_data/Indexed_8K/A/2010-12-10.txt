Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On November 12, 2010, Agilent Technologies, Inc.
(the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and year ended October 31, 2010.  The November 12 press release reported GAAP net income of $232 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the fourth fiscal quarter, and $624 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010.  The Company is now reporting that GAAP net income was $292 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, for the fourth fiscal quarter, and $684 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, for fiscal 2010.  This increase in GAAP net income resulted from a decrease in the Company's provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter created by a full release of the Company's U.K. valuation allowance.
 
The Company's previously reported fourth quarter non-GAAP net income, its fourth quarter consolidated net cash flow from operations and its working capital at October 31, 2010 remain unchanged.
 
The financial statements included with the November 12 press release and this update to those financial statements contain preliminary results.  Final financial statements for the 2010 fiscal year will be filed with the Company's annual report on Form 10-K later this month.
 
The information in this Item 2.02 of Form 8-K is furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
