Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 20, 2011, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among the Company, certain lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administration agent, and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London agent.  The Credit Agreement replaced the Company's prior Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of May 11, 2007, which was terminated upon the execution of the Credit Agreement.
 
The Credit Agreement provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility (the "Facility") that will expire on October 21, 2016.  The Company may, subject to certain customary conditions, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the Facility in an amount not to exceed $300 million in the aggregate (the "Incremental Facility") and on up to two occasions extend the maturity date for a period of one year. Each Lender will have discretion to determine whether it will participate in the Incremental Facility or in any such extension of the maturity date. The Company will use amounts borrowed under the Facility for general corporate purposes.  The Company is not borrowing under the Facility at this time, but may borrow under the Facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise.
 
Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest either at: (i) the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) JPMorgan's prime rate in effect from time to time,  (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect from time to time plus 0.5% or (c) the applicable London interbank offered rate for 30-day loans plus 1.00%, in each case plus the applicable margin for such loans, or (ii) the applicable London or EURO interbank offered rate plus the applicable margin for such loans.  The applicable margin for loans bearing interest at the base rate ranges between zero and 0.450%, and the applicable margin for loans bearing interest based on the London or EURO interbank offered rate ranges from 0.920% and 1.450%, in each case based on the Company's senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. At the Company's current credit ratings, the applicable margin for the base rate is 0.125%, and the applicable margin for London or EURO interbank offered rate loans is 1.125%. Additionally, the Company will pay an annual facility fee during the term of the Credit Agreement which varies depending on the Company's credit ratings. At the Company's current ratings, the facility fee will be 0.125% per year, or $500,000 per year.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of liens, and limitations on incurrence of indebtedness by the Company's subsidiaries.  In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a ratio of adjusted consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Lenders may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are acting as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the Facility.
 
The description of the Credit Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse any Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
Unreimbursed Amount
mutatis
mutandis
 
(f)    Each Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the applicable Borrower's obligations hereunder.  None of the Agents, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any other event or circumstance; that nothing in this Section shall be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of any Issuing Bank (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be
Obligations Absolute.
provided
 
deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(g)    The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit issued by it.  The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by fax) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders of their obligations with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures.
provided
 
(h)    If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment, and shall be payable on demand or, if no demand has been made, on the date on which the applicable Borrower reimburses the applicable LC Disbursement in full.
Interim Interest.
provided
 
(i)    If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, each applicable Borrower shall deposit in respect of each outstanding Letter of Credit issued for such Borrower's account (or, in the case of the Company, with respect to which it is a co-applicant), in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank, an amount in cash equal to the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to such Letter of Credit as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to cash collateralize shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of
Cash Collateralization.
provided
 
any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company or any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII.  The Borrowers also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.21.  Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers' risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Monies in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to (i) the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure and (ii) in the case of any such application at a time when any Lender is a Defaulting Lender (but only if, after giving effect thereto, the remaining cash collateral shall be less than the aggregate LC Exposure of all the Defaulting Lenders), the consent of each Issuing Bank), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  If the Borrowers are required to provide cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such cash collateral (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.  If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers as promptly as practicable, to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would not exceed the aggregate Commitments and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.21, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers as promptly as practicable, to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, no Issuing Bank shall have any exposure in respect of any outstanding Letter of Credit that is not fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders and/or the remaining cash collateral and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
(j)    From time to time, the Company may by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below.  The acceptance by a Lender of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement, which shall be in a form satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent, executed by such Lender, the Company and the Administrative Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an Issuing Bank.
Designation of Additional Issuing Banks.
 
(k)    The Company may terminate the appointment of any Issuing Bank as an "Issuing Bank" hereunder by providing a written notice thereof to such Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent.  Any such termination shall become effective upon the earlier of (i) such Issuing Bank acknowledging receipt of such notice and (ii) the 10th Business Day following the date of the delivery thereof.  At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the terminated Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b).  From and after the effective date of any such termination, the terminated Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not issue additional Letters of Credit.
Termination of an Issuing Bank.
 
(l)    Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the face amounts of the Letters of Credit issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not effect any issuance, renewal, extension or amendment resulting in an increase in the aggregate amount of the Letters of Credit issued by it without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such increase is then permitted under this Agreement, (ii) on any Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iii) on any Business Day on which the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.
Issuing Bank Reports.
 
(m)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the obligations of the Lenders to acquire participations in Letters of Credit and to reimburse any Issuing Bank for Unreimbursed Amounts (other than Unreimbursed Amounts arising from LC Disbursements made prior to the Maturity Date) shall terminate with respect to any Collateralized Letter of Credit on the Maturity Date (it being understood that the Lenders shall continue to participate in, and shall be required to reimburse in accordance with this Section, any LC Disbursement made prior to the Maturity Date).  Any participation held by any Lender in a Collateralized Letter of Credit on the Maturity Date (other than in respect of any Unreimbursed Amounts arising from LC Disbursements made prior to the Maturity Date) shall be deemed to have been assigned on the Maturity Date to the Issuing Bank that issued such Collateralized Letter of Credit.
Collateralized Letters of Credit.
 
SECTION 2.06.    (a)  Each Lender shall make each Revolving Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:30 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the
Funding of Revolving Borrowings.
 
Lenders.  The Applicable Agent will make such Revolving Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Revolving Loans identified by the applicable Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request to be made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
provided
 
(b)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.13 (it being understood that nothing in this paragraph shall require any Borrower to pay any interest in duplication of the interest payable under such Section).
 
SECTION 2.07.    (a)  Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03 and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request or as otherwise provided in Section 2.03.  Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Revolving Borrowing (if denominated in US Dollars) to a Revolving Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Revolving Borrowing and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section and on terms consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement.  A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of an affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Revolving Borrowing and the Loans resulting from an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections.
 
(b)  To make an election pursuant to this Section, the electing Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type, and in the currency, resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such Interest Election Request shall be
 
irrevocable and shall be made by hand delivery or fax to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Applicable Agent and signed by a Financial Officer on behalf of the applicable Borrower (or, in the case of any Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, by telephonic notification, confirmed promptly by hand delivery or fax to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by a Financial Officer on behalf of the applicable Borrower).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a Borrower shall not be permitted to change the currency of any Borrowing or to elect an Interest Period for LIBOR Loans or EURIBOR Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d).
 
(c)  Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
 
(i)  the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing;
 
(ii)  the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
(iii)  the Type of the resulting Borrowing, which shall comply with Section 2.02(b); and
 
(iv)  if the resulting Borrowing is to be a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
 
If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
 
(d)  Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Revolving Borrowing.
 
(e)  If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, (i) in the case of a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing and (ii) in the case of any other LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or a EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be
 
continued as a Borrowing of the applicable Type and currency for an Interest Period of one month.
 
(f)  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrowers ( that no such notice shall be required in the case of any Event of Default under clause (h) or (i) of Article VII with respect to any Borrower), then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) in the case of Borrowings denominated in US Dollars, no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing and, unless repaid, each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (ii) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Alternative Currencies, unless repaid, each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing and EURIBOR Borrowing shall be continued as a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing or a EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing, as applicable, with an Interest Period of one month.

provided
 
(c)  The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.

New Commitments and increases in Commitments created pursuant to this Section shall become effective (A) in the case of an Increasing Lender already a Lender under this Agreement, on the date specified in the applicable notice delivered pursuant to this Section and (B) in the case of an Increasing Lender not already a Lender under this Agreement, on the effective date of the applicable Accession Agreement.  Upon the effectiveness of any Accession Agreement to which any Increasing Lender is a party, such Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights, benefits and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the aggregate Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this Section unless (1) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered under Sections 4.01(b) and 4.01(c) as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrowers to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase and (2) on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in Sections 4.02(a) and 4.02(b) shall be satisfied (with all references in such Sections to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase and without giving effect to the parenthetical in Section 4.02(a)) and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company.  Following any extension of a new Commitment or increase of a Lender's Commitment pursuant to this paragraph, any Loans outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such increase or extension shall continue outstanding until the ends of the respective Interests Periods applicable thereto, and shall then be repaid and, if the Borrowers shall so elect, refinanced with new Revolving Loans made pursuant to Section 2.01 ratably in accordance with the Commitments in effect following such extension or increase.

(d)  The applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by a written notice signed by a Financial Officer on behalf of the applicable Borrower of any prepayment of a Borrowing hereunder (i) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) above, as soon thereafter as practicable), (ii) in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency or a EURIBOR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, three Business Days before the date of such prepayment (or, in the case of a prepayment under paragraph (b) above, as soon thereafter as practicable), (iii) in the case of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such prepayment and (iv) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08(c).  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Applicable Agent shall advise the
provided
 
Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each optional partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type and currency as provided in Section 2.02.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
 
SECTION 2.12.    (a)  The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; that if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure.  Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date, and on the date on which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Lenders shall have no Revolving Credit Exposure; that facility fees accruing after the Commitments shall have terminated shall be payable on demand.  All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
Fees.

(b)  The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to LIBOR Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Accrued participation fees and fronting fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
provided
 
(c)  The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
 
(d)  All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Banks, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and Letter of Credit participation fees, to the Persons entitled thereto.  Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
 
SECTION 2.13.    (a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate set forth under the caption "ABR Margin" in the definition of such term.
Interest.
 
(b)  The Loans comprising each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate set forth under the caption "LIBOR/EURIBOR Margin" in the definition of such term.
 
(c)  The Loans comprising each EURIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted EURIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate set forth under the caption "LIBOR/EURIBOR Margin" in the definition of such term.
 
(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00% per annum plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
 
(e)  Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion or continuation of any LIBOR Revolving Loan or any EURIBO Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion or continuation.  All interest shall be payable in the currency in which the applicable Loan is denominated.
provided
 
(f)  All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (a) interest on Borrowings denominated in Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days and (b) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Adjusted LIBO Rate, Adjusted EURIBO Rate or Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Applicable Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.14.    If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest.
 
(a)  the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period; or
 
(b)  the Applicable Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining the Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or fax as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Applicable Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, an affected LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing, as the case may be, shall be ineffective, (ii) any affected LIBOR Borrowing shall (A) if denominated in US Dollars, be continued as an ABR Borrowing, or (B) otherwise, bear interest, from and after the end of the immediately preceding Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate equal to the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to be representative of the Lenders' cost of funding the applicable Loans (with the applicable Borrower and each Lender agreeing that the Administrative Agent may make such determination in any manner it determines is reasonable, and that such determination shall be conclusive) plus the Applicable Rate set forth under the caption "LIBOR/EURIBOR Margin" in the definition of such term, (iii) any affected EURIBOR Borrowing shall bear interest, from and after the end of the immediately preceding Interest Period applicable thereto, at a rate equal to the rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to be representative of the Lenders' cost of funding the applicable Loans (with the applicable Borrower and each Lender agreeing that the Administrative Agent may make such determination in any manner it determines is reasonable, and that such determination shall be conclusive) plus the Applicable Rate set forth under the caption "LIBOR/EURIBOR Margin" in the definition of such term and (iv) any Borrowing Request for an affected LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing shall (A)
 
in the case of a Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, be deemed to be a request for an ABR Revolving Borrowing or (B) in all other cases, be ineffective.
 
SECTION 2.15.    (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
 
(i)  impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate) or any Issuing Bank;
 
(ii)  impose on any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the London or European interbank market any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans, EURIBOR Loans or any Letter of Credit or participations therein; or
 
(iii)  subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)  If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company would have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)  If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or the cost to any Lender or any Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any
 
Letter of Credit to a Borrowing Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or any Issuing Bank (or its applicable lending office) is reduced) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to be material, by reason of the fact that such Borrowing Subsidiary is incorporated in, has its principal place of business in, or borrows from, a jurisdiction outside the United States, such Borrowing Subsidiary shall indemnify such Lender or such Issuing Bank from time to time for such increased cost or reduction.
 
(d)  A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section and the manner in which such amount or amounts have been determined, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Company shall pay or cause the applicable Borrower to pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(e)  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16.    In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or an optional prepayment of Loans), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Borrowers shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (but not for any anticipated profits) attributable to such event, including, if any of the foregoing Loans are denominated in any Alternative Currency, the actual costs and expenses of such Lender attributable to the premature unwinding of any hedging agreement entered into by such Lender in respect of the foreign currency exposure attributable to such Loan.  In the case of a LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as applicable, that would have been applicable to
Break Funding Payments.
 
such Loan (and, for avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to any Applicable Rate that would otherwise have been applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market.  The Borrowers shall also compensate each Lender for the loss, cost or expense attributable to any failure by a Borrower to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
SECTION 2.17.    (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for Taxes except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) required the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
Taxes.
 
(b)  In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
 
(c)  The relevant Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Recipient on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or an Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
(d)  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall
 
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e)  Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agents, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Agents for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agents in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by either Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agents to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agents to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e).
 
(f)  (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is resident or located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Company or any Agent, as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; that such Lender has received written notice from the Company advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and containing all applicable documentation (together, if requested by such Lender, with a certified English translation thereof).  In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or any Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or any Agent as will enable the Company or the Agents to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
provided
 
(ii)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is a U.S. Person,
 
(A)  any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender
 
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
 
(B)  any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
 
(1)  in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;
 
(2)  executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
 
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a "10 percent shareholder" of the Company within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a "") and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
 
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-2 or Exhibit G-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit G-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
 
(C)  any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender
 
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
 
(D)  if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(g)  If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, under this Section with respect to Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of the indemnified party, agrees to repay the amount paid pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event the indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
 
SECTION 2.18.    (a)  Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements or
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
 
otherwise) prior to the time required hereunder for such payment or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without any defense, set-off, recoupment or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders to such account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company, except that payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as provided herein shall be so directly made and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  Each Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document of principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall be made in the currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars.  Any payment required to be made by an Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Agent to make such payment.
 
(b)  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Agents to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c)  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provided
 
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including pursuant to Section 2.09) or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
 
(d)  Unless an Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lenders or Issuing Bank hereunder that the such Borrower will not make such payment, such Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each applicable Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to such Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to such Agent, at a rate determined by such Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(e)  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder to or for the account any Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, then each Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by such Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations in respect of such payment until all such unsatisfied obligations have been discharged or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Sections 2.04(c), 2.05(e), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c)), in each case in such order as shall be determined by such Agent in its discretion.
 
SECTION 2.19.    (a)  If any Lender requests any payments under Section 2.15, or if any Loan Party is required to pay Indemnified Taxes or any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign and delegate its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment and delegation (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
 
to such Lender.  The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment and delegation.
 
(b)  If (i) any Lender requests any payments under Section 2.15, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, (iv) any Lender becomes a Declining Lender or (v) any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (A) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts), (C) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, (D) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the status of such Lender as a Declining Lender, the assignee shall have agreed to the applicable Maturity Date Extension Request and (E) in the case of any such assignment and delegation resulting from the status of such Lender as a Non-Consenting Lender, such assignment, together with any assignments by other Non-Consenting Lenders, will enable the Company to obtain sufficient consents to cause the applicable amendment, modification or waiver to become effective.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each party hereto agrees that an assignment and delegation required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Lender required to make such assignment and delegation need not be a party thereto.

The Company may at any time and from time to time designate, subject to the provisions of this Section 2.20, any wholly owned Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company.  As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall make a copy thereof available to each Lender.  Unless any Lender shall inform the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days (or, in the case of any such Subsidiary that is a Foreign Subsidiary, 15 Business Days) following the receipt of such Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement by such Lender that it is unlawful
Designation of Borrowing Subsidiaries.
 
for such Lender to extend credit to such Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Borrowing Subsidiary at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrowing Subsidiary shall be outstanding hereunder; that such Borrowing Subsidiary Termination shall be effective to terminate the right of such Borrowing Subsidiary to make further Borrowings under this Agreement.

(b)  the Commitment and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 10.02); that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders affected thereby shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance with the terms hereof;
provided
 
(c)  if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
 
(i)  the Swingline Exposure (other than any portion thereof with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Section 2.04(c)) and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender (other than any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements with respect to which such Defaulting Lender shall have funded its participation as contemplated by Sections 2.05(e) and 2.05(f)) shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure (in each case, excluding the portion thereof referred to above) does not exceed the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments;
 
(ii)  if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent or an Issuing Bank ( that such Issuing Bank shall immediately also notify the Administrative Agent) (A) first, prepay the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure that has not been reallocated as set forth in such clause and (B) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Banks the portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure that has not been reallocated as set forth in such clause in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(i) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
provided
 
(iii)  if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay participation fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure for so long as such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
 
(iv)  if any portion of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted to give effect to such reallocation;
 
(v)  if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure that is subject to reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above is neither reallocated nor reduced pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Swingline Lender or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such portion of its Swingline Exposure shall be payable to the Swingline Lender until and to the extent that such Swingline Exposure is reallocated and/or reduced to zero; and
 
(vi)  if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure that is subject to reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such portion of its LC Exposure, and all participation fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such portion of its LC Exposure, shall be payable to the Issuing Banks (and allocated among them ratably based on the amount of such portion of the LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender attributable to Letters of Credit issued by each Issuing Bank) until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
 
(d)  so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Swingline Lender shall be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless in each case it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure, as applicable, will be fully covered by the Commitments of the Non-
 
Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral provided by the Borrowers in accordance with clause (c) above, and participating interests in any such funded Swingline Loan or in any such issued, amended, renewed or extended Letter of Credit will be allocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(i) above (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 
(e)  In the event that (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent shall have occurred following the date hereof and for so long as such Bankruptcy Event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan, and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the applicable Borrower or such Lender satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
 
(f)  In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
The Company and each other Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks that:

Any Person serving as an Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender or an Issuing Bank as any other Lender or Issuing Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or Issuing Banks.
 
The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agents shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Agents shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Agents are required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as an Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose such Agent to liability or to be contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, rule or regulation, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Agents shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by any of them or any of their Affiliates in any capacity.  The Agents shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by them with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as an Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of their own gross negligence or willful misconduct (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).  Each Agent shall be deemed to have no knowledge of any Default unless
provided
and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Agents shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.  Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, each Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company.  Upon any such resignation, the Administrative Agent (in the case of a resignation by the London Agent) or the Company (in the case of a resignation by the Administrative Agent) shall have the right, in consultation with the Required Lenders, to appoint a successor.  If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor.  After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of the retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.
 
Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon either Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon either Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
The parties agree that none of the Arrangers or Syndication Agents referred to on the cover page of this Agreement shall, in its capacity as such, have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
In order to induce the Lenders and the Issuing Banks to extend credit to the Borrowing Subsidiaries hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of each Borrowing Subsidiary.  The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
 
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrowing Subsidiary of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment.  The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrowing Subsidiary under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of such Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in favor of any Borrowing Subsidiary or any other Person.
 
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
 
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrowing Subsidiary to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
 
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrowing Subsidiary arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrowing Subsidiary to the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders.
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full and indefeasible performance and payment of the Obligations.
