Item 8.01.              Other Events
 
Starting with the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Agilent Technologies, Inc. ("Agilent") will report results in four separate business segments comprised of the electronic measurement segment, the life sciences segment, the chemical analysis segment, and the diagnostics and genomics segment.  This Form 8-K provides information on this change in segment reporting and a summary of the effects of this change on Agilent's historical segment results.  The change in segment reporting will be reflected retrospectively, but in no way revises or restates the GAAP Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period. The summary historical segment results do not include the historical results from the business of Dako A/S ("Dako"). Dako was acquired by a subsidiary of Agilent on June 21, 2012, and Agilent will file the historical and pro forma financial information relating to this acquisition required by Item 9.01(a) and (b) of Form 8-K by September 6, 2012.
 
The diagnostics and genomics segment is formed from a portion of the pre-existing life sciences segment plus the business of the recent acquisition of Dako.  The new operating segment was determined primarily based on how Agilent's chief operating decision maker views and evaluates its operations.  Operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.  Other factors, including technology and delivery channels, customer-specific solutions and specialized manufacturing, were considered in determining the formation of this new operating segment.
 
The diagnostics and genomics segment is primarily composed of two businesses, the genomics portion and Dako. The business of the genomics portion provides product platforms that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables that enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level.  Applications addressed by this portfolio include DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as automated gel electrophoresis-based sample analysis systems.  The business of Dako provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software primarily for use in anatomic pathology laboratories worldwide.  Dako also collaborates with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also called companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy.
 
The life sciences segment provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products. Key product categories in life sciences include: liquid chromatography systems, columns and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems; laboratory software and informatics systems; laboratory automation and robotic systems, dissolution testing; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems along with X-Ray crystallography, and services and support for the aforementioned products.
 
These changes were effective in the third fiscal quarter of 2012. The life sciences segment and the diagnostics and genomics segment financial information, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2012, will reflect this change. This change will be reflected on a retrospective basis, with prior years and quarters also adjusted to reflect the change in segments. Agilent is issuing this Form 8-K in order to provide investors with summary financial information and historical data that is on a basis consistent with its new reporting structure.  Exhibit 99.1 provides quarterly financial summary information by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and the first two fiscal quarters for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2012.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs.
 
In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.
 
(a)
 Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 3 of these tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Historical amounts have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.
