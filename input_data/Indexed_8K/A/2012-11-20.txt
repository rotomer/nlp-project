When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a vote of a greater number or voting by classes is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
If a quorum be initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.

Any stockholder entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or, except when the matter is the election of directors, may vote them against the proposal; but if the stockholder fails to specify the number of shares which the stockholder is voting affirmatively, it will be conclusively presumed that the stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all shares which the stockholder is entitled to vote.
2.10
    
Validation of Meetings; Waiver of Notice; Consent
.  The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy.
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereto, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, will be deemed equivalent to notice.  Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.
2.11
    
No Stockholder Action by Written Consent.

Bylaws, by agreement or by applicable law.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.
The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws.
2.13
    
Proxies
.  Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy filed with the secretary of the corporation.  A written proxy may be in the form of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the person.  No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.  A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or by filing another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the secretary of the corporation.
A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the corporation.
2.14
    
Inspectors of Election
.  Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors shall appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
Such inspectors shall:
The inspectors of election shall perform their duties impartially, in good faith, to the best of their ability and as expeditiously as is practical. If there are three (3) inspectors of election, the decision, act or certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
ARTICLE III
DIRECTORS
3.1
    
Powers
.  Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to any limitations in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
3.2
    
Number
.  The authorized number of directors shall be fixed and may be changed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires. If for any cause, the directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.
3.3
    
Election and Term of Office of Directors
.  Except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or Section 3.4 of these Bylaws, directors shall be classified, with respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, one class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2000, another class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2001, and another class to be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2002, with each class to hold office until its successor is duly elected and qualified.  At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms then expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election, with each director to hold office until such person's successor shall have been elected and qualified or until such person's earlier resignation or removal.  Each director, including a director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these Bylaws, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  For purposes of this paragraph, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director.  The votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election.  If an incumbent director is not elected due to a failure to receive a majority of the votes cast as described above and his or her successor is not otherwise elected and qualified, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors promptly following the certification of the stockholder vote.  The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider the offer to resign and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken.  The Board of Directors will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.  Any director who tenders his or her offer to resign shall not participate in either the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee's or Board of Directors' consideration or other actions regarding whether to accept the resignation offer.  However, if each member of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee failed to receive a majority of the votes cast at the same election, then the independent directors who did receive a majority of the votes cast shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept them.  However, if the only directors who received a majority of the votes cast in the same election constitute three or fewer directors, all directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers.
If an incumbent director offers to resign pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and the resignation offer is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal.  If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 hereof or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2 hereof.
Except as otherwise provided in the foregoing two paragraphs, each director, including a director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws; wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed.  Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws; wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed.
3.4
    
Resignation and Vacancies
.  Any director may resign effective on giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the
president
chief executive officer
, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws:
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders solely for he purpose of electing directors in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of the then outstanding shares having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
3.5
    
Removal
.  Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed from office only for cause by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
