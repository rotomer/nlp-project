Alcoa Strategy in Latin America (I)
Focused downstream operations
:
FRP:
Focus on high-value thin foil markets and exports
Packaging:
Sell PET and Latasa
Closures business aligned globally with CSI
Extrusions:
Leverage low-cost base to grow exports
Focus on differentiated segments in the domestic market
Alcoa Strategy in Latin America (II)
Strengthen and grow our low-cost primary position
Alcoa's primary assets in Latin America are among the lowest cost in the system
Investments in low-cost hydroelectric power generation assets will secure the position of our smelters over the long-term
Securing additional power in the region will provide the basis for growth of smelting capacity
We are pursuing opportunities to expand refining capacity at Alumar, and to develop bauxite mining to support further growth in refinery capacity

Attractive Upstream Growth Opportunities in Brazil
Mining:
Greenfield bauxite mine - Juruti
Refining:
Brownfield expansion at Alumar
Opportunities for further greenfield and brownfield expansions
Smelting:
Brownfield expansion at Alumar
Additional greenfield smelters as we secure hydro power
All at attractive low investment cost
Alcoa is Actively Pursuing Growth in Asia
Asia is expected to comprise 55% of the worldwide Aluminum consumption growth through 2010
Over 50% of Asia's growth to occur in China
Participation in Asia offers tremendous opportunity for global players
Deficit today in many high-value products
Potential for very low-cost production
Alcoa has established an important presence in the region over many years
Alcoa is now pursuing an aggressive growth plan in Asia
Restructured can sheet joint venture with Kobe
Major Projects in China

Global Sourcing
Growth in China's Primary Capacity Had Modest Impact on World Market
China's primary metal supply has moved into slight export surplus
Capacity expanded strongly
Largely due to expansion of existing facilities
Little impact from small high-cost capacity exiting
Growth of production was more subdued
Deficit of high-cost alumina
Regional electricity shortages
Environmental crackdown
China remains a net importer of aluminum
Scrap and semi-fabricated imports off-setting primary exports
Demand growth reflects developing economic structure

(1) Alcoa believes that income from continuing operations excluding charges for restructurings and divestitures is a measure that should be presented in addition to income from continuing operations determined in accordance with GAAP. The following matters should be considered when evaluating this non-GAAP financial measure:
    - --  Alcoa reviews the operating results of its businesses excluding the impacts of restructurings and divestitures.  Excluding the impacts of these charges can provide an additional basis of comparison. Management believes that these charges are unusual in nature, and would not be indicative of ongoing operating results. As a result, management believes these charges should be considered in order to compare past, current, and future periods.
    --  The economic impacts of the restructuring and divestiture charges are described in the footnotes to Alcoa's financial statements. Generally speaking, charges associated with restructurings include cash and non-cash charges and are the result of employee layoff, plant consolidation of assets, or plant closure costs. These actions are taken in order to achieve a lower cost base for future operating results.
    --  Charges associated with divestitures principally represent adjustments to the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and do not typically require a cash payment. These actions are taken primarily for strategic reasons as the company has decided not to participate in this portion of the portfolio of businesses.
    --  Alcoa's growth over the last five years, and the onset of the manufacturing recession led to the aforementioned charges in 2001 and 2002. Before the start of the current manufacturing recession, Alcoa last recorded charges associated with restructuring and divestitures in 1997.
    --  Restructuring and divestiture charges are typically material and are considered to be outside the normal operations of a business. Corporate management is responsible for making decisions about restructurings and divestitures.
    --  There can be no assurance that additional restructurings and divestitures will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both income from continuing operations determined under GAAP as well as income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and divestiture charges.
(2) Special items totaled $15 of income for the second quarter before taxes and minority interests.  The amount is comprised of adjustments to the estimated proceeds on several businesses to be divested that resulted in net gains, and was offset by additional layoff charges primarily for businesses serving the aerospace and primary metals markets.  After tax and minority interests, special items amounted to a loss of $2 in the quarter.
