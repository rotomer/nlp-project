At this point, I'd like to turn it over to (Rick) Kelson.
 
 
The 4th quarter had many highlights worth mentioning. Safety performance continues to top the list. Including recent acquisitions, we had a lost workday rate of 0.11 in the quarter, continuing to make progress toward our goal of 0 work-related injuries and illnesses.
 
Income from continued operations reached thirty-nine cents per share, versus a loss of seventeen cents in the 4th quarter of 02. Revenues were up on a sequential quarter based on higher realized primary pricing, both metal and alumina, offset by normal seasonal declines in can sheet, closures and the building and construction business.
 
We continue to significantly reduce our debt to capital ratio, which stood at 35.1% at the end of the year, and 800 basis points improvement over the ending 2002 figure. We paid down over $1.2 billion in debt this year. We continued to spend capital wisely in the 4th quarter, with $120 million reduction over the 4th quarter of last year. The 4th quarter spend was $293 million, or 94% of depreciation.
 
In addition, we took $12 million of costs out of the businesses in the 4th quarter, meeting our cost challenge for 2003. And lastly, we've been

successful in executing our divestiture plan, with two sales closed in the 4th quarter, the sale of packaging equipment business already announced in 1st quarter and two additional closings anticipated this quarter.
 
Moving on to some more detail; as always, let me start with safety. Including recent acquisitions, as I noted, we achieved a 0.11 lost workday rate, and a 1.68 total recordable rate in the 4th quarter of last year. In the quarter, we had 94repeat that, 94% of our facilities without a lost workday. And 64% without a recordable injury. As you can see from the graph, for the full year, we avoided 44 injuries by lowering our lost workday rate.
 
To put this in perspective, in the quarter, we had just 33 lost workday incidents, for nearly 65 million hours worked across Alcoa's global location. Our target remains 0.075 lost workdays by 2005. Our substantial continued improvement is evidence of the strong desire in this organization to continually improve upon the way we do our work.
 
Let's move on to the financials for the quarter. This slide compares our 4th quarter results with the prior quarter. Relative to the 3rd quarter, GAAP earnings from continuing operations improved by $58 million, or 21%. This is attributable to a continued strong alumina market, higher metal realizations, as well as focused cost reductions helping to overcome unfavorable currency and power costs.
 
We also benefited from insurance settlements and higher special items, each of which I'll address in a couple minutes.
 
Revenues in the 4th quarter were $5.5 billion, up 4% sequentially, and 9% year over year. Cost of goods sold rose to 80.2% of sales, versus 79.2% in the prior quarter on the weaker dollar and higher energy costs. SG&A also

increased over the 3rd quarter, based largely on increased deferred compensation expense and the usual 4th quarter timing of resource unit spending.
 
Other income in the quarter was up $97 million, largely based on a gain associated with the settlement of insurance litigation for environmental coverage between 1956 and 1985.
 
Our effective tax rate declined in the 3rd quarter, to 21% from 22%, stemming from a ruling in a non-US subsidiary that allowed us to capture net operating losses. As we discussed in the past, we're unable to forecast these discrete tax benefits and the current accounting requires us to take the benefits in the period they are realized, as opposed to spreading it out during the year for a smooth ETR. This net operating loss benefit was somewhat offset by higher taxes associated with the (Latasa) sale.
 
As you've seen, we've achieved a number of these discrete items this year. Without these items, our underlying tax rate would have been closer to 30%. For 2004, our best estimate of the tax rate less discrete items, is about 30%.
 
Many of you have asked about the effect of the weakening US dollar on the results. The translation effect on the results was an unfavorable $27 million after tax, versus the 4th quarter of 2002, and $19 million after tax on a linked sequential quarter basis.
 
Note, this is only the effect of foreign currencies associated with translating monetary assets on the balance sheet, and does not include the effect of the weaker US dollar on the cost structure in non-US locations.

A few other items of note. In the quarter, we reversed the previously recorded loss in two facilities that we took back into continuing operations. These were the Magnolia and Plant City facilities. In addition, we had a loss associated with discontinued operations due to lower than expected proceeds on a particular business.
 
Now let me turn to one of the major highlights of the quarter and of the yearcash generation. We continued to make substantial progress on cash generation in the quarter. We generated $733 million in cash from operations in this quarter alone. This was driven by strong earnings and working capital reduction. For the year, cash from (ops) was up $591 million.
 
On the working capital front, even with higher sales, we were able to reduce receivables and inventories in the quarter. Day sales outstanding, or DSO's, improved by two days, to 42 days from 44 days in the 3rd quarter. Inventory days on hand improved by three days, to 52 days from 55 days in the 3rd quarter. And days payable improved by 2 days, rising to 41 days from 39 days in the prior quarter.
 
As you know, we had a capital expenditure target to spend less than $1 billion in 2003. We ended the year with a total capital outlay of $867 millionour lowest capital spend since 1994. This (restraint in) capital spending freed up cash flow to pay down debt, and given the growth projects we have upcoming, we don't expect to be able to sustain this low capital spending rate and for 2004, we plan to maintain a $1 billion budget for sustaining capital in the normal ongoing growth projects. However we would expect an additional $300-400 million of spending on our announced upstream growth projects. Most notably, Iceland, (Suriname) and (Pinjarra). Just to put this in perspective for you, this level is similar to our spending rate in 2002, of $1.3 billion.

Now let me address each of the segments in turn, and we'll start with alumina and chemicals. Once again, with the pie charts, we tried to give you an idea of the relative importance of the various markets and the segments. These are all based on 4th quarter revenues.
 
Looking on a sequential quarter basis, strong realized prices contributed to a $9 million, or 8% increase in ATOI from the prior quarter. Realized prices increased 5% sequentially, or $9 a ton. Less shipments were flat. The higher prices were driven by a combination of higher contracts and spot prices. On a year over year basis, realized alumina prices were up 33%, resulting in a 45% after tax operating income increase.
 
Moving to the current business conditions. On the positive side, the Jamaica expansion is complete and along with normal production creep, will add incremental volume in the quarter. On the negative, the strong A dollarstrong Australian dollarhas and will continue to negatively impact the segment. As I've eluded in prior workshops, we're doing less currency hedging; therefore, we are more exposed to the higher A dollar than we've been in the past.
 
And in 2003, we completed the alumina purchase agreement from the Sherwin facility that we divested in 2001. The net impact of this will be that we have less material to sell on the spot market in 2004.
 
Next, let's turn to primary metals. On a sequential quarter basis, ATOI improved $3 million, or 2% from the prior quarter. Realized pricing increased 2 cents per pound, or 3% with shipments up 9%. We experienced higher energy and alumina costs, as well as a negative currency impact. Relative to the year ago quarter, realized prices increased by 11%, while total shipments were up 6%.

Moving to business conditions. On the positive side, (LME) on a 30 day lag basis is up a nickel a pound. On the negative side, obviously we still expect to see higher alumina and power costs, as well as the negative impact of currency.
 
We'll move on to flat roll product segment. The can sheet business contributes nearly half of the revenue for this segment, with the rest split between transportation markets, building and construction and the distribution channel. You can see the increase in can sheet this quarter associated with the inclusion of the Australian rolling assets that we picked up with the dissolution of our Kaal joint venture with Kobe. On a sequential quarter basis, both shipments and revenue were positively affected by the inclusion of the Australian rolling assets. Without this inclusion, both would have been flat.
 
ATOI for the segment was down $6 million. As to the current business conditions, we expect to see stronger demand for US sheet and plate, and the Australian rolling assets will be consolidated into the segment for a full quarter.
 
We're going to move to the engineered product segment. We typically see a 4th quarter decline in profitability in this segment and this quarter was no exception. On a sequential quarter basis, while shipments for the segment were offdown about 4%overall revenues held up well, finishing flat for the quarter. Profitability declined 30% on a sequential quarter basis, with the largest driver being maintenance shutdowns at a couple of our businesses within the segment.

As to business conditions, on the positive side, we see demand improving in some areasparticularly commercial transportation. And we see the aero and auto businesses remaining steady. The 4th quarter maintenance outages that I've mentioned are now completed so we won't see that reoccur. On the negative side, we continue to see pressure in the industrial gas turbine market, and higher raw material costs, specifically energy.
 
Let's turn to the packaging and consumer segment. Sequentially ATOI was flat, with normal seasonal profit increases at the consumer businesses being offset by seasonal declines at closures. On a year ago basis, revenues are down 3%, due to the sale of Latin America PET business. The profitability decline has also been driven in large part by higher resin prices. On a year ago basis, resin prices are up between 5-24%, depending upon the type of resin.
 
When we look at the current business conditions for this segment, we will see a seasonal decline in consumer business from the 4th quarter level and the sale of Latin America PET and (Latasa) had been completed, therefore these businesses will no longer contribute to the segments results. And we would expect continued pressure on margins due to resin price.
 
Now we'll move to the "other" segment. Just to refresh your memory, the "other" segment now has four businesses in it. The two AFL businessestelecommunications and automotive. Alcoa Home Exteriorsour residential building products business and our automotive structures business.
 
On a sequential quarter basis, ATOI was up $9 million in this segment, driven by cost savings at the two automotive businesses, both AFL and the structures businessas well as top line improvement in telecommunications. Looking

to the business conditionsautomotive build rates remain steady, while residential building and construction is expected to be seasonably soft.
 
Next, let's move on to discuss our cost challenge. As I've highlighted, we completed our second cost challenge in six years, with a 4th quarter cost savings of $12 million. This quarter savings were driven by purchasing and prior period restructuring savings at the AFL automotive business, Purchasing savings in alumina, and productivity savings at auto structures. As you can see from the chart on the right, over the life of the three-year challenge, 45% of the savings has come from manufacturing productivity; while procurement savings contributed roughly 38%, with the rest coming from overhead reductions, both in the plants and at corporate.
 
The next slide looks at the cost challenge in another way. Take a look at the next one. This bridge gives you another perspective on the cost challenge that we've just completed. When you look back to the start of the programJanuary 2001you can see that significant declines in prices, volumes and mix have contributed to our earnings negatively. This chart shows a 4th quarter 2000 earnings indexed to 100% and the relative changes from the major drivers. So specifically, prices eroded 39% of our earnings. This is just not a lower LME price, it's lower realized primary pricing, lower realized FRP prices, as well as the lower prices that we saw in the engineered products segment.
 
Volume is off also 44% from that time period, and then mix an additional 19% of the cost. However cost savings have been able to mitigate approximately 45% of this downturn.
 
Let's turn to our ROC challenge on the next slide. By now, all of you are familiar with this chart, which shows profitability as measured by ROC. The

red line represents Bloomberg top (quintile) ROC entries. The blue line represents Bloomberg's measure of Alcoa over a four quarter rolling time horizon. The green line shows our quarter returns annualized.
 
On this basis, we've made considerable progress over the course of this year, reaching an annualized ROC of 7.6% in the 4th quarter, up from 6.4% at the start of the year. Later along, we'll address our 2006 goals.
 
I'd like to turn to one other issue that we've addressed annuallyand that's pensions, on the next slide. There are three key drivers for pension calculations. The first one is actual plan asset returns. And in 2003, our actual overall return for our plans is 19.75%. The second driverlong-term asset returns assumptions. Here, we're going to continue to use 9% as our long-term assumptions. Our 10-year return average exceeds 10-

/
2
%. And the third driver is the discount rate assumption. This is the rate used to discount the projected benefits paid to the employee. We've changed this assumption to 6.25% from 6.75%. Now, with all that given the strong asset performance, we did not have the material (charge) for the balance sheet for pensions in 2003.
 
In addition, as we've told you before, we did not need to make material increases in pension funding in 2004. Last year, we contributed approximately $100 million globally and we do not expect to have any material change in that. On the income statement, we are projecting an additional $50 million of after tax expense due to the lower discount rate again this year.
 
Let me just sum up before I turn this over to Alain. In summary, we've continued to execute in the 4th quarter. We continue to drive cost savings,

pay down debt, and invest for the future. I think with that, I'll turn it over to Alain.
 
 
Well we went out and I think we continued to show that we've managed our values and continue to deliver on the values. (Rick) talked about the strong safety performance. We continue to track our environmental targets and going for the 20/20 challenges that you know about. We improved our profitability and strengthened our balance sheet, giving it all kind of flexibility, which is the objectives that we told you we have. And we continue to build for the future.
 
In every segment of our company, we had activities that not only worked on the present, on the past, but also built for the future. Every one of them had growth. Every one of them had cost reduction programs. Every one of them had divestitures when needed and investment to increase competitiveness. You can see them all there. In some we position ourselves with the customers better than we were before and some we changelike in the flat roll product in Australia. We did a deal with the Japanese partners and is up with 100% of those two rolling mills in Australia in exchange for the half ownership we have there and in Japan.
 
We continued to invest in Brazil in our bauxite In power generation. Continued to make progress on inert anodescan talk about that two

minutes. We're doing better in this. We have made progress. We still have the same issues we talked the last quarter, which has to do with the length of life of anodes and the cost of it. We will come back to you by the end of this year in the 3rd quarter and tell you where we are.
 
We continue to invest in the primary business of the company and in the fabricating business of the company. We continue to shoot for better performance. We're never happy with the kind of performance we have. We continue to live our values, provide superior returns, continue to reduce cost. We've announced another $1.2 billion cost reduction on a run rate basis at the end of 2006 and aim to maintain a strong balance sheet, with debt between 25-35%.
 
And finally, 2003 performance showed significant improvement over 2002. We continue to position the company for the success for 2004 and beyondthinking and acting forward. Our Alcoa strategy is clear. Our actions are very focused. Our goals remain high. And I'd like to talk about two issues that you might ask a question about.
 
One was some of you discounted the insurance case and the taxes. And I'd like to say that we manage our whole balance sheet. We drive for costs everywhere. To get those insurance proceeds, we had to invest over $25 million in legal fees, which are in the numbers that you asked us aboutwhy are they at that levelwe had over $30 million of legal settlements and issues all over the country. But it came to the bottom line and it came to the cash of the company.
 
As I told the board, if I'm playing tennis and the ball hits the net and gets over to the other side, I say, "Sorry, but it counts." And when I used to play footballsoccerand the ball hit the other guy and it went into the net, guess

what? We didn't even ask. Sorry, it just counted. We count this one. We worked very, very hard to get it and we always worked hard to get any income from any of the resources given by shareholders to the management of this company. Thank you. We are ready for questions.

I think in the totality of it all, we think that cost savings that we've taken outas I've said, many of those were structural on the manufacturing side. Those will put us in great stead when these markets come back. We try real hard not to discount cyclicalwe don't cyclical procurement savings. So we try to get
ALCOA

01-22-04/3:00 pm CT
Page 15
 
structural ones of those, although as markets come back, there will be more pressure on the procurement side. So we like to think that those cost savings are in large part, they don't prepare us for any upswings in the market. But again, obviously there will be pressure from the material side as well.
 
 
 
 
Our people met with the governor of the state of (Barah) and discussing their intentionswhat they were thinking about. Their total project was something like $1.4 billion over ten years, which includes not only bauxite mining, it
ALCOA
Fourth Quarter Analysis

includes the expansion that in the smelter and refinery area, as well as power investments in different places in Brazil. And I guess the governor thought it was a great number and he went out and announced that we're going to make a $1.4 billion project in (Barah). If you know anything about a bauxite mine, it costs you about $100 per ton to build. If you're going to have a two million ton bauxite mine, it's $200 million. But anyway, as to the drop, this is part of negotiating (power) contracts and availability of concessions.
 
Brazil is defining how they are going to deal with wheeling of power and what role the government has in power generation and so this is all part of those discussions. We're still aiming at continuing to grow in Brazil in energy and smelter and the whole primary sector.

targeted. Most of those are already included in the prior challenge. So there's very little left in that. But yes, to the extent Ivex and Fairchild continue to save be it productivity or procurement, it would be in the ($1.2) billion.

And with regard to the Bonneville area, you know that it's pretty simple for us. If the cash cost is higher or close to the market price, if we close the plant and sell the alumina in this case, or sell the energy when it's our own energy, or we have long term contracts. Specifically in the Bonneville area, we have a partnership with a Japanese company that might have a difference of opinion with us as to what should operate.

and The amount Excluding the impacts of these charges can provide an additional basis of comparison. Management believes that of ongoing operating results. As a result, management primarily for strategic reasons as the company has decided After tax and minority interests, special items amounted to income of $25 in the impairment is a measure that should be presented in addition to income from continuing operations determined in accordance with GAAP. The following matters should be considered when evaluating this non-GAAP financial measure: Alcoa reviews the operating results of its businesses excluding the impacts of restructurings and divestitures and goodwill impairment. these charges are unusual in nature, and would not be indicative believes these charges should be considered in order to compare past, current, and future periods. The economic impacts of the restructuring and divestiture charges are described in the footnotes to Alcoa's financial statements. Generally speaking, charges associated with restructurings include cash and non-cash charges and are the result of employee layoff, plant consolidation of assets, or plant closure costs. These actions are taken in order to achieve a lower cost base for future operating results. Charges associated with divestitures principally represent adjustments to the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities do not typically require a cash payment. These actions are taken not to participate in this portion of the portfolio of businesses. Alcoa's growth over the last five years, and the onset of the manufacturing recession led to the aforementioned charges in 2001 and 2002. Before the start of the current manufacturing recession, Alcoa last recorded charges associated with restructuring and divestitures in 1997. Restructuring and divestiture charges are typically material and are considered to be outside the normal operations of a business. Corporate management is responsible for making decisions about restructurings and divestitures. There can be no assurance that additional restructurings and divestitures and goodwill impairment will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both income from continuing operations determined under GAAP as well as income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and divestiture charges and goodwill impairment. principally represents net gains from assets held for sale including the reversal of previously established reserves for businesses that Alcoa decided to retain, and a realized gain on the sale of a business, partially offset by adjustments to estimated proceeds for ongoing sale activities. fourth quarter and full year of 2003. Notes to Reconciliation (1) Alcoa believes that income from continuing operations excluding charges for restructurings and divestitures and goodwill       (2) Special items totaled $26 of income for the fourth quarter and full year of 2003 before taxes and minority interests.
