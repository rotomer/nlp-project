On September 15, 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Alcoa Inc. ("Alcoa") approved the following changes for performance-based equity awards granted for 2005 and future years under the shareholder-approved 2004 Alcoa Stock Incentive Plan:
 
 
 
 
No change was made to the performance period (one-year), vesting provisions (three-year cliff vesting after the date of grant) or dividend equivalent payment provisions of the awards. Approximately 60 Alcoa senior executives, including the five executive officers named in the 2005 Proxy Statement and Alcoa's other executive officers, are eligible for performance-based equity awards.
 
Alcoa has previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the 2004 Alcoa Stock Incentive Plan (see exhibit 10(c) to Alcoa's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004), and the original Form of Agreement for Performance Share Awards and Rules for Performance Share Awards (see exhibits 10(c) and 10(f), respectively, to Alcoa's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004).
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
