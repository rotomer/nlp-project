Operator
 
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the fourth quarter 2005 ALCOA Inc. earnings conference call. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS] As a reminder today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today's presentation, Mr. Bill Oplinger, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
 
Bill Oplinger
- ALCOA Inc - Director, IR
 
Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for attending ALCOA's fourth quarter 2005 analyst workshop. At today's conference, Joe Muscari, Chief Financial Officer will review the fourth quarter and current business conditions and Alain Belda, Chairman and CEO will review 2005 and discuss our priorities for 2006.
 
Before I turn it over to Joe, I would like to remind you that in discussing the Company's performance today, we have included some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements relate to future events and expectations and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. ALCOA's actual results or actions may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For a summary of the specific risk factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements see ALCOA's annual report and Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, and Form 10-Q, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, filed with the SEC. In our discussion today, we have also included some non-GAAP financial measures. You can find our presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our related reconciliation on our website, at www.alcoa.com under the invest section.

- ALCOA Inc - CFO
 
Thanks, Bill. We will start today by jumping straight into the fourth quarter performance and first off let me just say that we were disappointed with where we ended up on a net basis but are encouraged by the improvement track we see in a number of businesses, specifically Alumina, primary metals, and engineered solutions. In addition, the business fundamentals continue to be very positive. Demand for aluminum is robust driven by strong long term growth especially coming from China. Pipe [primary] metal inventories and high input costs have boosted LME prices above $2,000 per ton. Aerospace sales continued to grow in the fourth quarter rising 7% across the Company. These positive cyclical aspects were offset by seasonal declines in our automotive, building and construction, and can sheet markets. Lastly, commodity, raw materials, and energy costs continue to increase. Alain will share more on cost inflation and the impact on ALCOA later.
 
In this environment, ALCOA grew total revenue to $6.7 billion, an increase of 2% on a sequential basis, earnings from continuing operations of $210 million, included a negative net $93 million of significant items. Our upstream businesses had strong performances and cash from operations improved significantly, totaling $1 billion in the quarter. The balance sheet strengthened with debt to total capital improving to 30.8%. We continued to execute on our major long-term growth initiatives which are now starting to deliver. I will spend more time on this area in a few minutes.
 
In the third quarter, we told you about operational issues in our Alumina and AFL businesses. This quarter Alumina showed output improvement and posted the highest level of monthly production on record. And AFL is now on a more solid improvement track. Finally, our Davenport facility achieved a record level of plate production which helped to meet increasing demand from our aerospace customers.
 
Let's take a quick look at the fourth quarter from a market standpoint. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the relative percentage change in revenue from the sequential and year-ago quarters. We've provided you with general guidelines in the past to help understand pricing and our upstream businesses. These will inevitably vary based on particular market conditions and customer contracts, but over the long run, should give you a good directional sense of pricing.
 
As I mentioned initially, the markets for our upstream products are very strong. Average LME prices for the quarter are up $247 a ton. As you recall, we typically price metal sales on the lag of approximately one month or so. On this basis, average prices for the quarter increased $147 a ton. ALCOA's third party realized price increased by 11% in the quarter. We generally recognize LME price changes on a one quarter lag for alumina. The average LME on a one quarter lag basis is higher by about $43 per ton or 2%. ALCOA's realized price for alumina was up 6% for the quarter.
 
Now, turning to the downstream markets, aerospace is clearly the leader, rising sharply on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. This is an extremely attractive market for us, and we are expanding capacity as you know to better serve these customers. Most of the downstream markets experienced seasonal declines although they were higher year-over-year based in part on higher metal prices.

Let's now move to our key areas of management focus beginning with safety. We ended the year with 428 locations around the world, and 129,000 employees. Our lost workday rate equaled the benchmark performance of 0.090 that we achieved in 2004. At this lost workday rate we totaled just 115 lost workdays on over 254 million hours worked. 82% of our facilities did not experience a lost workday in 2005. Our recordable rate for the year was 1.37. We experienced 1,748 recordable events in 2005, which was a very, very dramatic improvement of 19% over 2004. In addition, here as well, 44% of our facilities had no recordable injuries. We continue to be a benchmark of safety performance among major industrials.
 
At this point, I would like to discuss the progress we've made on our growth projects in the quarter. Starting with Alumar, this 63,000 metric ton expansion is the completion of pot line three in San Luis, Brazil and belongs to ALCOA 100%. The first pots were energized in the fourth quarter and the expansion will be complete this quarter. This brownfield expansion will come on line with capital costs of less than $3,000 a ton and conversion costs among the lowest in the world. This will bring ALCOA's overall ownership of the Alumar smelter to 60%. In Guinea we found [signed] an MOU with the government of Guinea and another partner to explore the feasibility of a greenfield refinery which would be sourced from the CBG bauxite mine. In Rockdale, ALCOA and the Texas Utility signed a letter of intent in the fourth quarter which paves the way for TXU to build a fifth generating unit at the power plant. ALCOA would enter into a long-term agreement to receive power from the new unit. This will effectively replace units one through three which are scheduled to be shut down early next year. The agreement is important in that it adds to the size and scale of our Three Oaks lignite mine and extends the life of our 265,000-ton smelter at Rockdale.
 
Juruti, this area is one of the best and largest single bauxite deposits in the world with favorable logistics so it constitutes a unique opportunity as a source for the Alumina [Alumar] refinery expansion. The initial mine will be 2.6 million tons but can be expanded to 12 million tons as bauxite demand in the region grows.
 
In October, we formed the Bohai joint venture where ALCOA is the managing partner holding a 73% stake. This investment is the foundation piece for ALCOA's global flat-rolled product strategy in China, with a focus on high value-added products. In addition to the initial 50,000 tons of foil capacity, ALCOA plans to invest over $200 million in a major hot mill expansion of the facility. We anticipate having the mill commissioned by 2008 with output growing at more than 220,000 tons. The Merck's [Merxheim's] fine architectural coating line is a new line that will be capable of coating thin aluminum coils, it is a $40 million facility and it's going to enable our building and construction systems business to meet increasing demand and we are expected to have this operational by early 2007.
 
In Hungary, we initiated a modernization. This is an $83 million investment at Kofem. The project includes an expansion of flat-rolled mill products capability, the addition of Dura-Bright production, and the launching of a manufacturing operation for airflow castings. The modernization itself will create nearly 200 new jobs and is expected to be completed by the end of 2007.
 
Our ALCOA fastening systems business created two new 50,000 square foot manufacturing sites in Suzhou, the industrial park in China, this is about 100-kilometers from Shanghai and these were put in to support the rapidly-growing commercial aviation and rail car production markets in China. These were expected to be in production early  earlier this year. Ingen [Tianjin] is the first of two closure facilities we established in China in 1994, the second facility which has always been wholly owned was opened in Honjou [sp] in 2004 and we took full ownership of that.
 
Next, I would like to give you a brief update on some of our new products under development. Simultaneous multi-alloy continuous casting, better known internally in ALCOA as SMACC is a proprietary technique for a simultaneous casting of multialloy slabs used in the production of brazing sheet, and other high-added value applications and what we've done here is we've initiated a pilot facility in [Amorebieta] so that is under way. The hurricane resistant panels, this is a major building product innovation that uses proprietary ALCOA technology and is targeted at a growing market of roughly $125 million. Demand for the hurricane impact products is being fueled by usage beyond the Gulf and Florida coast to coastal locations as far north as Canada. These products have passed the required test internally and are currently under approval by state authorities and we're planning to launch in early 2006.
 
Dura-Bright, and other commercial vehicle components, what we're doing here is leveraging the success of our Dura-Bright truck wheels into new opportunities. Dura Flange for heavily loaded trucks and Dura-Bright fuel tanks are receiving high grades in their market testing. And we are working on Dura-Bright applications for OEM, OEM car wheels, and have developed specialty wheels with the unique patterns that will be introduced to the marketplace during 2006.
 
We've also developed and specified recently a range of proprietary fasteners that are applicable to composite structures including the Boeing 787. As you will recall, approximately two-thirds of our aerospace portfolio is now propulsion and fasteners and these new products establish new avenues for growth. We continue to see interest globally in the aluminum bottle, as can makers and beverage companies in Japan, Europe, and the U.S. increase their development efforts and test marketing of this packaging innovation. We've also developed closures that reduce oxygen

ingress and are cost competitive to conventional closures. Vinyl Lock [Vino-Lok] has received a strong reception in the marketplace and we're currently in trials at wineries in every major wine growing region. We've also launched the slow cooker liner to meet convenience and quick cleaning needs as consumers return to long duration cooking. Anyway, I just wanted to give you a quick overview. We've got a number of others going, but we plan to periodically give you updates of how we're progressing in our various product development areas. Let's now move to operational excellence.
 
I would like to just briefly share a few highlights of how the ALCOA business system has been an integral part of impacting the bottom line. An all-time production record on the 220-inch mill was set this quarter. This is the most critical piece of equipment, I think as many of you know, in the Davenport aerospace flow path and the improvement was achieved through focused application of TPM and daily management, two very powerful ABS processes.
 
I touched on our refining system earlier. But our entire global refining system improved output by 2% in 2005, and much of this occurred in the fourth quarter, despite forced shut downs in Jamalco with Point Comfort. The western Australia system had record production in the fourth quarter and six of our nine refineries had new annual production records in 2005. We're on a track for  we were on a track for production records in the Atlantic system before the hurricanes. And also, in Latin America, we are able to improve our flow facilities by over 35%, again through the focused application of daily management control and TPM to review bottlenecks and basically free up untapped capacity that we could sell.
 
We'll look at portfolio management. In the quarter, we completed the sale of Southern Graphics in December for approximately $408 million in cash. Southern Graphics is a packaging design and imaging business we acquired in the Reynolds acquisition. We also curtailed Eastalco. The plant's power contract expired on December 31, and to date, we've been unable to secure a new competitive power supply agreement. The plant is a 195,000-ton smelter that is 61% owned by ALCOA. And we will continue to operate the cast house during a transition period to continue serving our customers until new billet capacity in Quebec is brought online next year.
 
We also announced the realignment of our global extrusion assets and this alignment and technology gives us the opportunity to serve our customers with global capacity and capabilities better by combining our hard alloy and rod and bar assets worldwide. We're able to more fully explore opportunities, particularly in the aerospace sector, and industrial rod and bar markets. Bringing together our soft alloy extrusion assets globally will create, will actually enable us to drive adoption of best practices more effectively across the system, and at the same time, enable specialization within each of these soft alloy separate market segments.
 
You've all seen our press release for the quarter. Income from continuing operations was $210 million or $0.24 per share, which includes a net negative impact of $0.11 as I mentioned earlier per share associated with several items that I will discuss in a moment. We generated strong cash flow in the quarter, with cash from ops of $1 billion. This enabled us to improve our debt to total capital by 0.7 percentage points to 30.8. We've been able to fund our growth projects increasing capital expenditures to $2.1 billion this year, while maintaining debt within our target range. Our revenues for the quarter were up on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. 2005 ROC was 8.3%, and 9.5% when growth projects such as Iceland and Russia are excluded. This performance marks the fourth consecutive year of improvement in our return on capital.
 
Let me now turn to the major variances on the income statement. SG&A rose to 5.4% of sales due mainly and in part to a prior period adjustment related to Russia. Not recurring. And several year-end charges. I will talk about restructuring that you see on here on the next page. You will also notice the interest expense improved by 18 million in the quarter. This is the result of three items, a rise in project spending, a decrease in our debt balance, and a capitalized interest adjustment in one of our regions. The change in other income is due to the gain on the sale of railroads in the third quarter and various mark-to-market adjustments in the fourth quarter. Minority interest rose and improved performance in our Alumina business, and the increase in discontinued ops reflects the performance and gain from the sale of Southern Graphics during the quarter.
 
As noted, previously, we experienced items in the fourth quarter that totaled a negative $93 million. Let me provide some further detail on these. Hurricane and business interruptions resulted in losses of $55 million. The impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita accounted for a large part of this, which was higher than we actually advised at the end of the third quarter. This also included part of that in the hurricane estimates, or hurricane number, I should say, includes losses for lower production, higher  as well as higher material and energy costs that we experienced. Production rates at Jamalco and Point Comfort were also negatively impacted by approximately 92,000 metric tons as a result of the hurricanes. These facilities by the way are actually still struggling to get back to pre-hurricane output levels.
 
Business interruptions include the previously announced outages at our ABI and Wenatchee smelters along with an unplanned outage at our Portland facility and those smelter-related events resulted in losses of approximately $15 million. The unplanned outage of the Portland facility resulted in production losses of 3,000 tons per month and the facility is not expected to be fully operational until the fourth quarter of 2006. We

also realized noncash mark-to-market losses of $22 million, the largest portion of which relates to imbedded derivatives in certain power contracts. These losses have no immediate cash impact to the Company.
 
Restructuring efforts totaled $19 million in the fourth. These actions include the previously announced curtailment of the Eastalco smelter, approximately $10 million, and the continuation of the comprehensive restructuring program initiated in 2005. Net cost to integrate and transform our Russian facilities totaled $14 million, $21 million of losses were recorded in the segments with $7 million offset attributable to inter-company transactions. This increases the total for the year to $69 million, which is an improvement over the estimate of $80 million we provided in the second quarter. For 2006, we expect this growth investment to result in $45 million of additional losses. Finally, we had credits of $17 million, the largest of which was $10 million for power purchases in our Italian operations, which relate to prior periods.
 
We'll look at cash flow. Cash from operations totaled $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter, in part due to an improvement in working capital despite higher metal prices. This comes on the back of a $240 million working capital improvement in the third quarter as well. The strong cash performance helped bring our 2005 cash from ops to $1.7 billion after having made a voluntary $300 million cash pension contribution in the third quarter. Capital expenditures rose to $762 million in the quarter, as we continued to invest in advantaged large upstream growth projects. Nongrowth capital expenditures totaled 93% of depreciation in the quarter. And for the year, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion. In 2006, we expect CapEx to be between $2.5 and $3 billion.
 
Before we talk about the segments in detail, I thought it would be useful to provide some broader context for these results. You will see in the chart that over the period, from the beginning of 2003, we've realized a steady increase in third party revenues. These gains have come on higher metal and product pricing, and have been consistent over the seasonal movements in our businesses. Through the latter half of 2004, we were able to translate that to improved after-tax operating income. More recently, however, rapid cost inflation and operational issues have limited our ability to drive this revenue growth to the bottom line. This has been and will continue to be a major point of focus for us as we attack the cost side, as well as the output and operational excellence side of the equation. As I mentioned earlier, as we look at the first quarter, we continue to see the operational side improving within the context of a continuing very strong aluminum market.
 
As we look at Alumina, on the left side, you will see that Alumina had a great quarter. Revenues were up 6% based on higher metal prices and segment ATOI was up 17%. The production increased by roughly 1% versus the third quarter, despite the lost production due to hurricanes. On the right side, you will see the strong progress in production increases driven largely by operating improvements. In the early part of this year, we had operating performance issues which the primary group have worked hard to overcome and now expect to accelerate our rate of improvement. Alumina pricing has been driven by significant increases in LME and LME percentages over the past few years, but has been accompanied unfortunately by equivalent increases in the cost of production inputs. In the fourth quarter, increases of $3 million in energy and $4 million in caustic soda costs contributed to the increase in production costs. Looking ahead, we expect steady improvement in production levels, lower input costs, specifically caustic and labor, but are expected to be offset by higher natural gas costs.
 
Moving to primary metals, primary metals also had a strong quarter, total revenues grew by 7%, and segment ATOI rose 44% sequentially to $242 million. The major driver of quarterly results was higher metal price, operational efficiencies, and stabilized costs. Total shipments declined as the Company purchased less primary metal for internal use. Purchases for the quarter were 164,000 metric tons, down from 189,000-tons in the third quarter. Primary metal production for the quarter was 900,000-tons, essentially even with the prior quarter. Increased production from the Alumar expansion was offset by the outage in the Portland smelter and idle capacity now stands at a 525,000 tons following a curtailment at Eastalco. Note that for the quarter, substantially all of the mark-to-market impact is recognized in the primary segment's results. [Alcoa correction: As stated in Alcoa's press release announcing its fourth quarter 2005 financial results, the mark-to-market impact on metal and metal-related activity is not recognized in the segment results for the Primary Metals segment.]
 
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2006, production will decline approximately 26,000 tons with the curtailment of Eastalco. The Alumar smelter in Brazil is expected to contribute roughly 4 to 6,000 tons incrementally for a net decrease of around 20 to 22,000 tons. Further, from a pricing standpoint, the majority of our aluminum is open to the market.
 
Moving to flat-rolled products, we had continued strong performance in the flat-rolled products segment, which, when we exclude Russia rose $20 million or 37% against the year-ago quarter. Strong productivity improvements in the quarter and favorable aerospace mix were offset by raw material energy increases and we also had seasonally lower can sheet volumes along with the Russian losses. In the first quarter of 2006, we expect aerospace demands to remain strong. We also expect to see the seasonal upticks in canned sheet and automotive and the Russian costs as I mentioned earlier also expected to be lower.
 
Construed [Extruded] and end products, seasonal declines in building and construction, coupled with overall weak market conditions and soft alloy extrusions and higher energy costs drove revenue declines of 6% and ATOI down by $26 million. Performance overall was basically

comparable to last quarter, to prior year quarter. Looking ahead, we expect building and construction and the automotive markets to experience their seasonal increases in demand.
 
As I touched on earlier, the engineered solutions business group had a great quarter. ATOI for the segment increased 42% sequentially to $46 million on a revenue increase of 2%. Year-over-year revenues and ATOI were higher by 10%. Continued strong aerospace demand drove performance at our investment castings and forged products fastening systems and wheel products businesses. The previously mentioned operational issues at AFL automotive began to abate in the quarter and we expect that to continue to improve in the first quarter. Looking forward to the first quarter, aerospace will remain strong. And the segment will benefit from continued progress both at AFL and some of the other units.
 
In packaging and consumer, hurricane-related events had a significant impact on the business by approximately $12 million after tax due largely to higher resin costs that occurred during the period and that have been occurring. Segment ATOI declined $8 million as the fourth quarter strength and our consumer business was more than offset by the higher raw material costs and seasonally lower volumes of our closures business. On a year-over-year basis, performance at our packaging businesses has been negatively impacted by higher raw material costs, both resin and metal. Looking ahead, consumer products volumes will decline and we expect sustained high resin costs combined with higher metal costs.
 
Just to briefly summarize our view of the first quarter of 06, the current strong metal prices, aerospace strengths, and some seasonal upswings in building and construction did have a positive impact on our results. In addition to these, we have made progress on the various operational issues that have occurred in the fourth quarter. In summary, while the fourth quarter was difficult, the actions we're taking to cut costs and regain momentum on productivity improvement projects could result in better operational results. Now, I will turn it over to Alain.
 
Alain Belda
- ALCOA Inc - Chairman, CEO
 
Well, thanks, Joe. Since reviewing the quarter, I'm going to take a few minutes to put 2005 into perspective and discuss our strategic priorities going into 2006. This year, we've accomplished many things. We continued to deliver values with strong safety performance, less environmental impact, and continued strong community engagement. We battled higher input costs all year, and I will show you more. And we managed our markets well, strategically positioning the Company to capitalize on the strength of our key markets. We managed what was under our control, improved return on capital, cash flow, balance sheet, costs, mix, pricing, and volumes. Excluding the LME price effect on primary, we have achieved revenue growth of $1.9 billion or 8%. We managed our portfolio, sold some assets, restructured others, and changed management where we were not doing enough progress. Lastly, we continued to invest in our growth projects, globally both upstream and downstream, and repositioning assets for lower costs, and higher competitiveness.
 
The financial results are an outcome of the action. Double digit top line growth, $1.2 billion income from continuing operations, a stronger, flexible balance sheet, and a 9.5% return on capital excluding Russia and construction work in progress. This is, like Joe said, this is the fourth year of continuing improvement. Was our execution perfect or are we satisfied with the results and the answer is, no. But I won't minimize the accomplishments we've made in 2005. In the integrated aluminum industry and the flat-rolled products business, in the investment casting business, including forgings and fasteners, we are the only company that has created value in the current cost environment while continuing to invest and laying the foundation for future organic growth, and we will talk more about this.
 
You've become accustomed to seeing this chart from us, which shows the major impacts in the year. I'm sure many of you recall the chart we showed at the beginning of the year, where we estimated that input cost inflation, excluding energy and productivity would both be about $600 million, pre-tax, for 2005. As you can see from the chart, the input costs were higher than expected.
 
Let me look at it at the following way. Input costs inflation, energy inflation, and currency increases on our operating costs, resulted in a $747 million after-tax increase over the previous year. Passing through the LME prices, we took the risk of not selling forward and [deltas conscripts with contract constrained and increases] [dealt with contract constraints and increases], we bought scrap and selling and sold value-added products passing through raw material prices wherever we could, increasing prices wherever we could, improving mix, productivity, and volume. Net of added depreciation and overhead expenses, this resulted in an increasing comp [income] by $875 million. For a net positive of our actions against the costs of $128 million positive. In addition, we had tax benefits of $126 million, which also took some planning to get done. So we had a total of $254 million net positive from managing what was under our control.
 
To complete the picture, we also made other management decisions that affected negatively the P&L statement. The Russian investment, cost us $69 million for the year, and the restructuring business that contributed to total cost of our decision, up to $210 million. It still left a positive margin. But at the end of the day, we ended up with our results, about $140 million below the previous year results. And this was a consequence

of these $58 million nonrecurring charges that Joe talked about, plus additional ins and outs like the  how do you call, LIFO adjustment, and minority interest, and others.
 
Included in the significant actions we've taken during the course of this year, and previous years, were actions that contained health core and  health care and pension costs obligations in the United States. We now have more than 80% of U.S. employees participating in a consumer-based health care plan, with an average family contribution of more than $200 per month in 2006. Thanks to this health care costs have remained almost flat over the last three years in the U.S., on a per capita basis, despite continuing increases of over 15% per annum, for the less than 20% of the U.S. work force that still has a first dollar coverage. ALCOA's overall health care spending in the U.S. has declined over the last two years as a portion of our work force in the states has declined, and we took these actions to tackle inflation. We plan to address these issues in the contract negotiations with the union this year.
 
In 2005, we continued to manage our cash wisely. As you can see from this chart, our underlying cash generation, coupled with a rigorous divestiture program, largely funded the significant growth we are undertaking in the upstream. By the way, as we said we would do, at the beginning of the year. We improved our overall balance sheet flexibility during the year, as measured by a lower debt to cap, while investing nearly $1.3 billion in growth CapEx. This included spending in Iceland, motion anode [Mosjoen anode] plants, modernizations in Latin America and Brazil, Pinjarra upgrade, and further funding of our major pension plan by $383 million. We've also continued to improve our return on capital investments.
 
We weren't alone in seeing these higher costs. Our best estimates are that the entire industry across a cost curve experienced higher costs in 2005, on top of the cost increases from 2004. In aggregate, average costs per ton for the industry is up over $300 per ton since the end of 2003, upsetting much of the improvement in price. This shift in the cash cost curve has been driven by higher energy, carbon products, and alumina costs. While there are many ways to cope with this in a rising cost environment, we have focused on the key controllables within the upstream. These are getting the tons out of the door, which means production, and with the best productivity possible.
 
As you can see from these charts, we continued to make progress in both refinery and smelting production trends, during 2005. In refining, we increased production nearly 2% over the year, and continued on the four-year trend of production improvements. Productivity wasn't as strong as expected in the refinery business, as we struggled during the course of the year to overcome issues in Western Australia, commissioning issues in Suriname and outages caused by the hurricanes. At continuously operating smelters we increased production by nearly 2%.
 
We have restructured considerably in certain of our downstreams, where we have fundamentally strong franchises. Both Howmet and fasteners have experienced strong sales and margin growth in the year, underpinned by the surging aerospace market and our position with the major manufacturers. In air foil, we have a minimum of 53% market share, and up to 100% proprietary market share on the emerging Eclipse, the joint strike fighters, the A380, the F-22 and the 787 platforms. In fasteners, when you look at the programs that are emerging, we have the majority position on every one of these programs, both military and commercial. We are number one in the segment of the industry, and we have every reason to believe we will continue to be number one. In packaging, the closure business grew by 7%, and the overall revenue by 11%. And year-over-year, aerospace revenues are up 20%, driving both our flat-rolled products and hard alloy extrusion business to better returns.
 
The industry outlook is very bright. We see positive fundamentals. The last two, three months are the highest quarters in 10 years, and the present price is the highest one in 17 years. And inflation in general is in control. As you can see from this, general global aluminum consumption should double between 2005 and 2020. Which is being driven by the consumption growth in the BRIC countries. Asia will account for 60% of the growth and in 2020, will consume as much aluminum as the entire world does today. Putting this in perspective, this will require nearly 80 new smelters of 400,000 metric tons annual capacity, assuming that all of today's capacity stays online. This means adding five smelters per year, or 2 million tons per year, or adding 4 million tons of refineries every year.
 
Demand, as I said, is strong and we are in the best position to take advantage of the opportunities in alumina with our brownfield options, and have taken several initiatives in aluminum, also. Our existing global system of 26 smelters and nine refineries give us the perfect opportunity to capture the growth in the alumina and aluminum markets. This chart shows the current production profile of each of our major projects in smelter and refineries. Some important facts about these projects. All of the projects, both refinery and smelters will be in the lowest quintile of the cash cost curve. In addition to the refinery projects listed, the Guinea project could come on line after 2009.
 
The refining project would add 6 million metric tons to our existing base of 14 million tons, or a 40% growth. The refining projects will lower our overall refining costs per ton by approximately 15%. The smelting projects will add over 700,000 metric tons a year of base capacity to our 4 million metric ton present capacity. Or 17%. At today's metal price, and assuming the alumina is sold on long-term contracts, these projects will generate over $3 billion in revenue by 2009.

We are also positioning the Company to take advantage of accelerated growth in the semi-fab market by investing in a series of rolling, hard alloy extrusion, and forging investments, that will broaden our global footprint and increase our manufacturing flexibility. You've heard me talk often about Russia and Bohai. These two projects provide us with low cost global platforms for growth. Next, this means adding 500,000 metric tons of capacity, brownfield, and mostly in lower cost countries, at a much  and at much lower capital cost per ton of production, compared to the present capitalization of the group. In 2009, we will have roughly 42% of our production in low cost countries.
 
So just to recapture, in 2005, we made a number of strategic portfolio moves, curtailed smelters due to high energy prices, Eastalco and the Hamburg facilities. Sold our Elkem equity stake, sold Integris and Southern Graphics and swapped the telecommunication business with AFL. And we restructured a number of downstream businesses, reducing head counts by 7%, and targeting over $200 million in cost savings. Much of the divestiture and restructuring work was done in downstream businesses and investments were made in bulk side [sp], refinery, power, smelting, and rolling.
 
Well, let me end by reiterating our goals for 2006. First and foremost, we will continue to deliver values. We are consistently recognized to be a leader in the industry in safety and sustainable development. We will continue to deploy the ALCOA business system to achieve operational excellence, and capture the structural cost savings that were put in place this year. In addition to the growth plan in the upstream and integration that are new rolling assets, we will continue to actively manage the portfolio. We will keep a strong balance sheet and grow our return on capital. And lastly, we will continue to achieve profitable growth by capitalizing on the strong markets using technology as a strategic advantage, integrating Russia, and making opportunistic acquisitions that create value. At this point I'd like to turn it over to Bill to manage the questions and answers.

And the actions we have taken, both in restructuring and what you call productivity should result in an improvement over 2005.

Well, GM and Ford only  10% of our sales go to automotive, and the GM and Ford, it is mostly a question of what their volume is, and how the switch is happening between SUVs and new lines of products, like the crossovers. So that doesn't change our investment at all. Constraint of volume is mostly when you hit limits like at the moment the 220 mill which hit the record return  or record volume production, but there is still more to go there. So I don't think we're hitting market constraints  volume constraints at the moment. It is more we're managing the mixes, and defining what volume we want and where.

and the quality of the bauxite affected production. We talked also on refineries about the results of the hurricanes on both Jamaica and Point Comfort. In the smelter area, we had a problem in Portland, Australia, with a problem with a transformer that had slowed down production and taken some pots out of line until sometime mid this year. And then in ABI, and Canada, which if you remember, we had a strike last year, and we're still battling the life  the pot lives.

Good afternoon. I wonder if you gentlemen could just remind us about the percentage of your contracts for both RCS and Alumina which are going to roll over for this current year? And if you could give us a little bit of flavor on that, on the Alumina side and the new contracts, that you're entering into, over the medium term, are you guys generally realizing the percentage linkage closer to the 15, 16% we're hearing? Actually I'm hearing numbers higher than that, but could you talk about that that a little bit.
 
Joe Muscari

Yes, we're talking about Alumina?
 
Tony Rizzuto
- Bear Stearns - Analyst
 
Both Alumina and I want to try to mix into that one question, Joe, also RCS if we can.
 
Joe Muscari
- ALCOA Inc - CFO
 
Let me start with the RCS. As you know, we have been negotiating with our major customers, through a good part of 2005. And what we see right now is that after 2006, we will have two customers with no caps. So we have been relatively successful so far, but this is an ongoing process, and after 2007, directionally where we're headed now, there will be another customer with caps removed so we continue to make progress on that. With regard to Alumina, roughly I believe, was it last year, we had about a third of our contracts were renegotiated, and we were able to improve by about 2 points, 200 basis points in the contracts that we're seeing the benefit of now. Going forward in the next year, I think we're looking at roughly 10% of our Alumina supply, would be renegotiated. That's roughly from a rough estimate standpoint, that's what we're looking at right now.
 
Alain Belda
- ALCOA Inc - Chairman, CEO
 
Tony, on the RPD side, I would like to emphasize that of the aluminum production of ALCOA, less than 7% is side with a cap or a nonhedge price. And even in that case, the price is on specifically in the RPD, it is an $0.85 plus a midwest premium so that takes you over to $0.90 and we have substantially increased our use of scrap, which has a margin somewhere above $0.05. I mean contribution to costs. So the effect is pretty  it is still money, but it is much less significant to us, and then for the first quarter this year, the numbers we're talking about are  we are realizing more than $2,250 per ton on the metal. Including these.

Yes, the facility that we will be putting in there, the hot mill is going to be capable to make can sheet and that is part of our forward plans. It's going to be a multipurpose mill and we're focused on the higher value added segments once we start up in 2008 and can sheet will be part of the mix. The question is going to be how much of that will we actually do, and so we're still working through how much canned sheet we'll be making there but our focus is going to be to try to move up the value chain in China as fast as we possibly can and we have the technical capability to be able to do that. Because as you probably know, most of the rolled product imports into China are the higher value added products like can sleet, some of the automotive sheet products that are going in there, lighting sheet, and litho sheets.

Good evening. In past cycles, when smelters were announced shut, such as the 550,000 tons in your Maryland smelter and by various entities in Europe in the second half of last year, sometimes when better times came, those smelters reopened, bought for a token by an investor group such as the so-called Lazarus smelters at the Pacific Northwest a generation ago. Rather than have some new competitor enter the business, what measures would ALCOA take concerning Frederick, Maryland to keep it in the family and will you go so far as to bid on the smelters that may become available in Europe that people are shutting down?

On page 13 when you talk about your significant items, you have here for hurricanes and business interruptions, a charge of $55 million, and just to clarify, have you included higher raw material costs in that $55 million? I believe I heard you as well saying that it was natural gas and?
 
Alain Belda
- ALCOA Inc - Chairman, CEO
 
Yes, there were spots, when we  what occurred was there were shortages and so we were forced to go into the market because of the shortages and it cost us more than the even higher prices we were paying for resins. In case of  this was an earlier question that I wanted to come back to, so I'm glad you raised it. In the case of some of our facilities like our Tennessee facility, that the gas lines themselves had curtailment where there was no gas coming through so we also were forced to go out and pay prices sometimes 2X, 3X of the rates that we were incurring. So for those periods of time, when we had to go out to do it, we estimated those costs in here.

John Hill
- Citigroup - Analyst
 
Yes, thank you. I was hoping that you could shed a little bit more light on the extrusion business, and just explain for us one more time how that came to notch negative ATOI. I understand the hard alloys extrusions better than the soft but if you could just kind of walk us through the deterioration there, that would be great.
 
Joe Muscari
- ALCOA Inc - CFO
 
Well, a good part of what you're seeing, if you  again, if you look at quarter 04, quarter 05, were basically the same. Typically, you have you a seasonal drop-off for the soft alloy extrusions which is very, very heavy building and construction so that is primarily what you've seen there, what we're seeing.
 
Alain Belda
- ALCOA Inc - Chairman, CEO
 
John, we've separated those two types of markets, the hard alloy extrusion and the industrial products and rod and bar on one side, and separated the soft alloy extrusion, which is a sizable business worldwide, and this year, we will be talking every  basically every quarter when we review with you what progress we're making there, this is a challenge business, it is a commodity business, very local, very service-oriented. We had some problems with it. We have lost the management right in the middle of a big transformation. We brought some new people in. And this is going to be the challenge for 2006. And we will be talking as we go every quarter about the progress we're making there and we expect to make a lot of progress.
