Ladies and Gentlemen:
This opinion is being furnished in connection with:
 
 
As a Counsel of the Company, I am generally familiar with its legal affairs. In addition, I have examined the Articles and By-Laws of the Company; the Indenture dated as of September 30, 1993, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated January 25, 2007 (together, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee, as Trustee, under which the Notes will be issued; the Registration Statement; the resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the filing of the Registration Statement and the issuance and sale of the Securities; the Certificate of Designated Officer Establishing Terms of Debt Securities dated January 22, 2007; and such other certificates of officers of the Company and other documents and corporate records as I have considered necessary for the purposes of this opinion.
On the basis of the foregoing, I advise you that, in my opinion, the Notes have been duly and validly authorized by the Company, and, upon proper execution, delivery and authentication in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture against payment therefor, the Notes will be legally issued and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with and subject to their respective terms and the terms of the Indenture, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and by general equitable principles, and except that no opinion is expressed as to the availability of the remedy of specific performance.
I am a member of the bar of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and my opinion is limited to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the laws of the United States of America.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company dated the date hereof and to the reference to me under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement and under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving my consent, I do not admit that I come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act.
Very truly yours,

The Offer is being made upon and is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated January 22, 2007 (the "Offer to Purchase") and the related Letter of Transmittal. Under the terms of the Offer, the purchase price for each $1,000 principal amount of 2007 Notes validly tendered and accepted for payment will be based on a fixed spread of 10 basis points, or 0.10%, over the yield to maturity based on the bid side price of the 4% U.S. Treasury Note due August 31, 2007. The yield to maturity of the reference U.S. Treasury Note used in the fixed spread formulas will be set at 2:00 p.m. ET, on January 26, 2007 or a later date if the Offer is extended (the "Price Determination Date").
The Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. ET on January 30, 2007, unless the Offer is extended or earlier terminated. Tendered 2007 Notes may be withdrawn at any time before the expiration time.

It is expected that payment will be made on February 1, 2007. Alcoa intends to raise proceeds through the issuance of securities to pay for all, or a portion of the 2007 Notes purchased pursuant to the Offer. Alcoa, however, may elect to use cash on hand or available borrowing under its commercial paper program to pay for all, or a portion of the 2007 Notes purchased pursuant to the Offer.

1. (a) Alcoa Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Company"), proposes to issue and sell from time to time certain of its debt securities ("Debt Securities") and warrants ("Warrants") to purchase Debt Securities ("Warrant Debt Securities"), which Debt Securities or Warrant Debt Securities may be convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"), registered under the registration statements referred to in Section 2(a) ("Registered Securities"). The Debt Securities and Warrant Debt Securities will be issued under an indenture, dated as of September 30, 1993 ("Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, N.A.

The Warrants will be issued under Warrant Agreements (each a "Warrant Agreement"), between the Company and a bank or trust company, as Warrant Agent, on such terms as shall be determined at the time of sale. Particular series of the Debt Securities and Warrants will be sold pursuant to the Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, for resale in accordance with the terms of offering determined at the time of sale. Any Debt Securities and any Warrants involved in any such offering are hereinafter referred to as the "Offered Debt Securities" and "Offered Warrants", respectively, and collectively as the "Securities", and Warrant Debt Securities issuable upon exercise of Offered Warrants are hereinafter referred to as the "Offered Warrant Debt Securities". The firm or firms which agree to purchase the Securities ("Underwriters") and the representative or representatives of the Underwriters, if any, specified in a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 are hereinafter referred to as the "Representatives"; provided, however, that if the Terms Agreement does not specify any representative of the Underwriters, the term "Representatives", as used in this Agreement (other than in Sections 2(b), 5(c) and 6 and the second sentence of Section 3), shall mean the Underwriters.

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:

Status under the Act.
 
3. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities will be evidenced by an exchange of facsimile or other written communications ("Terms Agreement") at the time the Company determines to sell the Securities. The Terms Agreement, except as otherwise provided therein, will incorporate by reference the provisions of this Agreement in their entirety and will specify the firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the names of any Representatives, the principal amount of any Offered Debt Securities (including, if applicable, the number of shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion or exchange of the Offered Debt Securities) and the number and certain other terms of any Offered Warrants (including the principal amount of the related Offered Warrant Debt Securities and, if applicable, the number of shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion or exchange of the Offered Warrant Debt Securities) to be purchased by each Underwriter, the purchase price to be paid by the Underwriters, any compensation or commissions to be paid to the Underwriters, the initial public offering price, the terms of the Securities and any Offered Warrant Debt Securities not already specified in the Indenture and the Warrant Agreement, including, but not limited to, interest rate, maturity, any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements, and whether any of the Securities may be sold to institutional investors pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined below) as hereinafter provided. The Terms Agreement will also specify the time and date of delivery and payment (such time and date, or such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as the Representatives and the Company agree as the time for payment and delivery, being herein and in the Terms Agreement referred to as the "Closing Date"), the place of delivery and payment and any details of the terms of offering that should be reflected in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Securities. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities will be several and not joint. It is understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus. The Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date will be in definitive form, in such denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters may request.
Purchase, Offering and Delivery.
If the Terms Agreement provides for sales of Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, the Company authorizes the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Annex I attached hereto ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") with such changes therein as the Company may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors of the types set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. On the Closing Date the Company will pay, as compensation, to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the principal amount of Securities to be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts ("Contract Securities"). The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If the Company executes and delivers Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract Securities will be deducted from the Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and (a) in the case of an offering of Debt Securities with attached Warrants the aggregate principal amount of Offered Debt Securities and the number of Offered Warrants to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount of Offered Debt Securities and (b) in all other cases the aggregate principal amount of Offered Debt Securities
 
and the number of Warrants to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount of Offered Debt Securities and the number of Offered Warrants, respectively, in each such case set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in such Terms Agreement, except to the extent that the Representatives determine that such reduction shall be otherwise and so advise the Company. The Company will advise the Representatives not later than the business day prior to the Closing Date of the principal amount of Contract Securities.
4. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that it will furnish to the Representatives and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, two signed copies of any Registration Statement relating to the Registered Securities, including all exhibits, in the form it became effective and of all amendments thereto and that, in connection with each offering of Securities:
Covenants of the Company.
(a) The Company will file any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (including the Term Sheet in the form attached to the Terms Agreement) to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Act and will file the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 424(b) not later than the time required by such rules.
(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will advise the Representatives promptly of any proposal to prepare, use, authorize, approve, refer to or file any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or to amend or supplement any of the Registration Statements or the Prospectus and will afford the Representatives a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such proposed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or amendment or supplement and the Company will also advise the Representatives promptly of any use, authorization, approval, reference to or filing of any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the filing of any such amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any stop order proceedings or any proceedings pursuant to Section 8A of the Act in respect of the Registration Statement or of any parts thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.
(c)(1) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities, the Offered Warrant Debt Securities and the shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion or exchange of the Offered Debt Securities or the Offered Warrant Debt Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, or required to be delivered but for Rule 172 under the Act (the "Prospectus Delivery Period"), any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance and (2) if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Information as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Information to comply with law, the Company will immediately notify the Underwriters thereof
 
and forthwith prepare and, subject to paragraph (b) above, file with the Commission (to the extent required) and furnish to the Underwriters and to such dealers as the Representatives may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Information as may be necessary so that the statements in the Time of Sale Information as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Information will comply with law. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.
(d) As soon as practicable, but not later than 16 months, after the date of each Terms Agreement, the Company will make generally available to its security-holders an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12 months beginning after the later of (i) the effective date of any registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, (ii) the effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to any of the Registration Statements to become effective prior to the date of such Terms Agreement and (iii) the date of the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 1O-K filed with the Commission prior to the date of such Terms Agreement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act.
(e) The Company will furnish to the Representatives copies of the Registration Statements, including all exhibits, any prospectus, any related preliminary prospectus supplement, any related Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as are reasonably requested.
(f) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities, any Offered Warrant Debt Securities and any shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion or exchange of the Offered Debt Securities or the Offered Warrant Debt Securities for sale and the determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution.
(g) During the period of five years after the date of any Terms Agreement, the Company will furnish to the Representatives and, upon request, to each of the other Underwriters, if any, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to shareholders for such year; and the Company will furnish to the Representatives (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report or definitive proxy statement of the Company filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act or mailed to shareholders, unless they are otherwise available on the Commission's EDGAR system, and (ii) from time to time, such other information concerning the Company as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(h) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Underwriters for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by them in connection with qualification of the Registered Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, for the filing fee, if any, of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. relating
 
to the Registered Securities and for expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectuses, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any Time of Sale Information and any preliminary prospectus supplements to Underwriters.
(i) The Company will not, without the prior consent of the Underwriters or the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of (i) if the Securities are not convertible into Common Stock, any securities of the Company (other than pursuant to director or employee stock or other benefit plans existing or the conversion of convertible securities outstanding on the date of such Terms Agreement) which are substantially similar to its United States dollar-denominated debt securities having a maturity of more than one year, or (ii) if the Securities are convertible into Common Stock, shares of Common Stock or any other securities convertible into shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to director or employee stock or other benefit plans existing or the conversion of convertible securities outstanding on the date of such Terms Agreement) during the period beginning on the date of execution of a Terms Agreement with respect to the Securities and ending on (x) in the case of (i), the later of the related Closing Date or the date on which any price restrictions on sale of the Securities are terminated and (y) in the case of (ii), 30 days following the Closing Date.
(j) The Company will use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement in respect of any Offered Warrant Debt Securities during the entire period during which any Offered Warrants may be exercised.
(k) The Company will, pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433 under the Securities Act.
5. The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Securities will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent:

(g) The Representatives shall have received a letter, dated the Closing Date, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which reconfirms the matters set forth in their letter delivered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section and states in effect that:
(i) in their opinion, any financial statements or schedules examined by them and included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and not covered by their letter delivered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the related published Rules and Regulations;
(ii) they have made a review of any unaudited financial statements included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as indicated in their report or reports attached to such letter;
(iii) on the basis of the review referred to in (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A) the unaudited financial statements or summarized financial data, if any, included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus do not comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
(B) the unaudited capsule information, if any, included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus does not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which it was derived or was not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
(C) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than five business days prior to the Closing Date, there was any change in the capital stock or any increase in short-term indebtedness or long-term debt of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest available financial
 
information read by such accountants, there was any increase in the short-term debt of, the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus; or
(D) for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement of the Company read by such accountants there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding amount in the corresponding period of the previous year, in consolidated sales and operating revenues, income from operations, income before extraordinary gains (losses) or income of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, except in all cases set forth in clauses (C) and (D) above for changes, increases or decreases which the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(iv) they have compared certain agreed dollar or tonnage amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar or tonnage amounts) and other financial information contained in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and not covered by their letter delivered pursuant to subsection (a) of this section (in each case to the extent that such dollar or tonnage amounts or percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, which are subject to the internal controls of the accounting systems of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, or may be derived directly from such records by analysis or computation), with the general accounting records of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, and have found such dollar or tonnage amounts and percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such result, except as otherwise specified in such letter.
The Company will furnish the Representatives or, if there are no Representatives, the Underwriters with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents they reasonably request.
6. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in
Indemnification and Contribution.
 
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution to liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 11 (f) of the
 
Act. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by each party from the offering of the Securities (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be suitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose). No Underwriter or person controlling such Underwriter shall be obligated to make contribution hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total public offering price of the Securities purchased by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed any of the Registration Statements or any parts thereof and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
7. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities under the Terms Agreement and, in the case of an offering of Debt Securities or Debt Securities with attached Warrants, the aggregate principal amount of Offered Debt Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Debt Securities, or, in the case of an offering of Warrants only, the number of Offered Warrants which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total number of Offered Warrants, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under this Agreement and the Terms Agreement, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and, in the case of an offering of Debt Securities or Debt Securities with attached Warrants, the aggregate principal amount of Offered Debt Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Offered Debt Securities or, in the case of an offering of Warrants only, if any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the number of Warrants with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total number of Offered Warrants, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, such Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-
Default of Underwriters.
 
defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. In all other cases, unless otherwise specified in the Terms Agreement, if any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities under the terms of such Agreement and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within thirty-six hours after such default, such Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. The foregoing obligations and agreements set forth in this Section will not apply if the Securities are being purchased pursuant to a "firm bid" which is identified as such in the Terms Agreement. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. The respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts of Offered Debt Securities or, in the case of an offering of Warrants only, the number of Warrants, set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by the Company.
The foregoing obligations and agreements set forth in this Section will not apply if the Terms Agreement specifies that such obligations and agreements will not apply.
8. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters under the Terms Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
9. Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that

Attn.: Chief Financial Officer
Ladies and Gentlemen:
On behalf of the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto and for their respective accounts, we offer to purchase, severally and not jointly, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements contained in the Underwriting Agreement, dated January 22, 2007, relating to your Debt Securities and Warrants to Purchase Debt Securities, the form of which was incorporated as an exhibit to your Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-74874) ("Underwriting Agreement"), but subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein modified as set forth below (the provisions of which Underwriting Agreement, as amended, are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety and deemed to be a part hereof to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein), the respective principal amounts of Debt Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto ("Securities"), on the following terms:
 
 
 
Each of the Underwriters has agreed that it will not offer, sell, or deliver any of the Notes, directly or indirectly, or distribute the prospectus supplement or prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Notes, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will, to the best of the underwriters' knowledge and belief, result in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations and which will not impose any obligations on Alcoa except as set forth in this underwriting agreement.
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a Relevant Member State), each Underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the Relevant Implementation Date) it has not made and will not make an offer of notes to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the notes which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant
 
Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of notes to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time:
(a) to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
