IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD REFERRED TO ABOVE, THE HOLDER MUST CHECK THE APPROPRIATE BOX SET FORTH ON THE REVERSE HEREOF RELATING TO THE MANNER OF SUCH TRANSFER AND SUBMIT THIS CERTIFICATE TO THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS "OFFSHORE TRANSACTION," "UNITED STATES" AND "U.S. PERSON" HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.
IN ADDITION, PRIOR TO ANY TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY, THE HOLDER MUST FURNISH TO THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS BEING MADE PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Security to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Security.

In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Notice of redemption will be given by mail to Holders of Securities of this series, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Indenture.

repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities of this series repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase event provisions of this Security, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of this Security by virtue of such conflict.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a
 
Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Ratings Event).
"Change of Control" means the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company, its subsidiaries, or its or such subsidiaries' employee benefit plans, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture, and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture, shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place(s) and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (formerly Chase Manhattan Trust Company, National Association), as successor trustee to PNC Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.

The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Security to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Security.

In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Notice of redemption will be given by mail to Holders of Securities of this series, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Indenture.
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs and this Security has not been previously redeemed, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Holder's Securities of this series at a
 
repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities of this series repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase event provisions of this Security, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of this Security by virtue of such conflict.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a
 
Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Ratings Event).
"Change of Control" means the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company, its subsidiaries, or its or such subsidiaries' employee benefit plans, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

Holders of the Securities of this series shall have the rights set forth in, and shall be deemed to be bound by the provisions of, the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of February 23, 2007 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") between the Company and Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of September 30, 1993 (herein, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated January 25, 2007 between the Company and the Trustee (as defined below), called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to J. P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (formerly Chase Manhattan Trust Company, National Association), as successor trustee to PNC Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of (U.S.) $627,182,000.
The Securities of this series are subject to redemption, as a whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at any time or from time to time, on at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior notice to the Holders of the Securities of this series given as described below, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
 
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date:
 
 
The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Security to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Security.

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P.

"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be deemed to be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such redemption date.
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Notice of redemption will be given by mail to Holders of Securities of this series, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Indenture.
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs and this Security has not been previously redeemed, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Holder's Securities of this series at a
 
repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities of this series repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase Securities of this series on the payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase event provisions of this Security, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of this Security by virtue of such conflict.
On the repurchase date following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Securities of this series properly tendered the purchase price for the Securities of this series, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Security of this series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities of this series surrendered; provided that each new Security of this series will be in a principal amount of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a
 
Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Ratings Event).
"Change of Control" means the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company, its subsidiaries, or its or such subsidiaries' employee benefit plans, becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's Voting Stock or other Voting Stock into which the Company's Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed measured by voting power rather than number of shares.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

Holders of the Securities of this series shall have the rights set forth in, and shall be deemed to be bound by the provisions of, the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of February 23, 2007 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") between the Company and Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co.

P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (formerly Chase Manhattan Trust Company, National Association), as successor trustee to PNC Bank, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of (U.S.) $627,182,000.

The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of this Security to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of this Security.

In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Notice of redemption will be given by mail to Holders of Securities of this series, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, all as provided in the Indenture.
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs and this Security has not been previously redeemed, the Company will make an offer to each Holder of Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of that Holder's Securities of this series at a
 
repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Securities of this series repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the option of the Company, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase Securities of this series on the payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase event provisions of this Security, the Company may comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of this Security by virtue of such conflict.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Below Investment Grade Ratings Event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating shall not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular Change of Control (and thus shall not be deemed a
 
Below Investment Grade Ratings Event for purposes of the definition of Change of Control Repurchase Event hereunder) if the Rating Agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at its request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable Change of Control (whether or not the applicable Change of Control shall have occurred at the time of the Ratings Event).

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

(i) include information substantially to the effect of Annex A hereto in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, Annex B hereto in the underwriting or plan of distribution section of the Prospectus forming a part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and Annex C hereto in the letter of transmittal delivered pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer (it being understood that a Holder's participation in the Registered Exchange Offer is conditioned, among other things, on the Holder, by executing and returning the letter of transmittal, representing in writing to the Company as set forth in Riders A and B of Annex C hereto); and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act during the Exchange Offer Registration Period in order for Exchanging Dealers to deliver the Prospectus forming a part thereof in connection with their sales of Exchange Securities received pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 4(h) below.
 
3. If, (i) because of any change in law or applicable interpretations thereof by the Commission's staff, the Company determines upon advice of its counsel (who may be an employee of the Company) that it is not permitted to effect the Registered Exchange Offer as contemplated by Section 2 hereof, (ii) for any other reason the Registered Exchange Offer is not completed within 270 days after the date of the original issuance of the Securities, or (iii) if a Holder notifies the Company in writing prior to the 20
Shelf Registration.
th
day following the completion of the Registered Exchange Offer that it is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or in the case of any such Holder that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradable Exchange Securities in exchange for tendered securities, other than by reason of such Holder being an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act (it being understood that, for purposes of this Section 3, the requirement that an Exchanging Dealer deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales of Exchange Securities acquired in the Registered Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities acquired as a result of market making activities or other trading activities shall not result in such Exchange Securities being not "freely tradeable"), the following provisions shall apply:
(a) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 60 days after so required or requested to do so pursuant to this Section 3), file with the Commission and thereafter use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective under the Securities Act a Shelf Registration Statement, or shall, if permitted by Rule 430B under the Act, otherwise designate an existing effective filing with the Commission for use by the Holders of Registrable Securities and by Exchanging Dealers of Exchange Securities as a Shelf Registration Statement, relating to the offer and sale of such securities from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by the Majority Holders participating in the Shelf Registration Statement and set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement (such securities to be sold by such Holders under such Shelf Registration Statement being referred to herein as "Shelf Registration Securities"; , , that no Holder shall be entitled to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or to use the Prospectus forming a part thereof for resales of Registrable Securities unless such Holder has signed and returned to the Company a notice and questionnaire as distributed by the Company consenting to such Holder's inclusion in the Prospectus as a selling securityholder and providing such further information to the Company as the Company may reasonably request.
provided
however
(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders of securities covered thereby for a period of two years from the date of the original issuance of the Securities or such shorter period that will terminate when all securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or cease to be outstanding or otherwise cease to be Registrable Securities (in any such case, such period being called the "Shelf Registration Effectiveness Period").
 
4. In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement and, to the extent applicable, any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the following provisions shall apply:
Registration Procedures.
(a) (i) The Company shall furnish to you, prior to the filing or designation thereof with the Commission, a copy of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, each amendment thereof and each amendment or supplement, if any, to the Prospectus included therein and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reflect in each such document, when so filed or designated with the Commission, such comments as you reasonably may propose.
(ii) The Company shall furnish to you, prior to the filing or designation thereof with the Commission, a copy of any Shelf Registration Statement, each amendment thereof and each amendment or supplement, if any, to the Prospectus included therein and shall use its best efforts to reflect in each such document, when so filed or designated with the Commission, such comments as any Holder whose securities are to be included in such Shelf Registration Statement reasonably may propose.
(b) The Company shall ensure that (i) any Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any Prospectus forming part thereof and any amendment or supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective (or, in the case of a previously filed registration statement that is effective at the time it is designated as a Shelf Registration Statement, when it is so designated), contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any Prospectus forming part of any Registration Statement, and any amendment or supplement to such Prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(c) (1) The Company shall advise you and, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall advise the Holders of securities covered thereby:
(i) when such Registration Statement and any amendment thereto has been filed (or, in the case of a previously filed registration statement that is effective at the time it is designated as a Shelf Registration Statement, when it is so designated) with the Commission and when such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective (or, in the case of a previously filed registration statement that is effective at the time it is designated as a Shelf Registration Statement, when it is so designated); and
 
(ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus included therein or for additional information.
(2) In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall advise you and the Holders of securities covered thereby, and, in the case of an Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall advise any Exchanging Dealer which has provided in writing to the Company a telephone or facsimile number and address for notices:
(i) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;
(ii) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the securities included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and
(iii) of the happening of any event that requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement or the Prospectus included therein so that, as of such date, the statements therein are not misleading and do not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading (which advice shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes have been made).
Each such Holder or Exchanging Dealer agrees, that, upon being so advised by the Company of any event described in clause (iii) of this paragraph (c)(2), such Holder or Exchanging Dealer agrees that it shall forthwith discontinue disposition of such securities under such Registration Statement or Prospectus, until such Holder's or Exchanging Dealer's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by paragraph 4(k) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed.
(d) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement at the earliest possible time.
(e) The Company shall furnish to each Holder of securities included within the coverage of any Shelf Registration Statement, without charge, at least one copy of such Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if the Holder so requests in writing, any documents incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto (including those incorporated by reference therein).
 
(f) The Company shall, during the Shelf Registration Effectiveness Period, deliver to each Holder of securities included within the coverage of any Shelf Registration Statement, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary Prospectus) included in such Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Holder may reasonably request; and the Company consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders of such securities in connection with the offering and sale of the securities covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(g) The Company shall furnish to each Exchanging Dealer which so requests, without charge, at least one copy of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules and, if the Exchanging Dealer so requests in writing, any documents incorporated by reference therein and all exhibits thereto (including those incorporated by reference therein).
(h) The Company shall, during the Exchange Offer Registration Period, promptly deliver to each Exchanging Dealer, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus included in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Exchanging Dealer may reasonably request for delivery by such Exchanging Dealer in connection with a sale of Exchange Securities received by it pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer; and the Company consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by any such Exchanging Dealer, as aforesaid.
(i) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Securities under all applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement shall reasonably request by the time the applicable Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission or otherwise becomes effective, and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable each such Holder to consummate the disposition in each such jurisdiction of such securities; , that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this provision, (ii) take any action which would subject it to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or (iii) make any changes to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or other organizational documents) or any agreement between it and holders of its ownership interests.
provided, however
(j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraph (c)(2)(iii) above, the Company shall promptly prepare a post-effective amendment to any Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to the related Prospectus or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include an untrue
 
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(k) Not later than the effective date (or the designation date, in the case of a previously filed registration statement that is effective at the time it is designated as a Shelf Registration Statement) of any such Registration Statement hereunder, the Company shall provide a CUSIP number for the Exchange Securities registered under such Registration Statement, and provide the Trustee with certificates for such Exchange Securities, in a form, if requested by the applicable Holder, eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company or any successor thereto under the Indenture.
(l) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission to the extent and so long as they are applicable to the Registered Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration and will make generally available to its security holders a consolidated earnings statement (which need not be audited) covering a twelve-month period commencing after the effective date (or the designation date, in the case of a previously filed registration statement that is effective at the time it is designated as a Shelf Registration Statement) of the Registration Statement and ending not later than 15 months thereafter, as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of such period, which consolidated earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.
(m) The Company shall cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, on or prior to the effective date (or the designation date, in the case of a previously filed registration statement that is effective at the time it is designated as a Shelf Registration Statement) of any Shelf Registration Statement or Exchange Offer Registration Statement.
(n) The Company may require each Holder of securities to be sold pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company in writing such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request for inclusion in such Registration Statement. The Company may exclude from any such Registration Statement the securities of any such Holder who fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request. Each Holder as to which any Shelf Registration is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading. Each Holder further agrees that, neither such Holder nor any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement on such Holder's behalf, will make any offer relating to the securities to be sold pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement that would constitute an issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company
 
under Rule 433 of the Securities Act, unless it has obtained the prior written consent of the Company (and except for as otherwise provided in any underwriting agreement entered into by the Company and any such underwriter).
(o) (i) In the case of any Shelf Registration Statement, if any of the securities covered by such Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the underwriter or underwriters and manager or managers that will manage such offering shall be selected by the Majority Holders of such securities included in such offering and shall be acceptable to the Company. The Company shall enter into such agreements (including underwriting agreements in the form contained in the Company's existing shelf registration statement (Reg. No. 333-74874) (the "existing shelf registration statement"); , that the Company shall not be required to enter into such agreement more than once with respect to all the Registrable Securities and Exchange Securities considered in the aggregate and may delay entering into such agreement until the consummation of any underwritten public offering which the Company may have then undertaken and in such connection whether or not an underwriting agreement is entered into and whether or not the registration is an underwritten registration), and in connection therewith, if an underwriting agreement is entered into, cause the same to contain indemnification provisions and procedures no less favorable than those set forth in the existing shelf registration statement (or such other provisions and procedures acceptable to the Majority Holders and the Managing Underwriters, if any), with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to Section 6 hereof.
provided
(ii) Without limiting in any way paragraph (o)(i), no Holder may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (x) agrees to sell such Holder's securities to be covered by such registration on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Majority Holders and the Managing Underwriters and (y) completes and executes in a timely manner all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required by the Company or the Managing Underwriters in connection with such underwriting arrangements.
(p) In the case of any Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall (i) make reasonably available for inspection by the Holders of securities to be registered thereunder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney or accountant retained by the Holders or any such underwriter, all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries reasonably requested by such person; (ii) use reasonable efforts to cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by such person in connection with any such Registration Statement, in each case, as is customary for due diligence examinations in connection with similar primary underwritten offerings; , , that any information that is nonpublic at the time of delivery of such information shall be kept confidential by the Holders or any such underwriter, attorney,
provided
however
 
accountant or agent, unless such disclosure is made in connection with a court proceeding or required by law, or such information becomes available to the public generally or through a third party without an accompanying obligation of confidentiality; (iii) make such representations and warranties to the Holders of Registrable Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters, if any, as may be reasonably requested by them, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in similar primary underwritten offerings; (iv) obtain opinions of counsel (which includes its employees who are attorneys) to the Company (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Underwriters, if any) addressed to each selling Holder and the underwriters, if any, covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by such Holders and underwriters; (v) obtain "cold comfort" letters (or, in the case of any person that does not satisfy the conditions for receipt of a "cold comfort" letter specified in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72, an "agreed-upon procedures" letter under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 35) and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), addressed to each selling Holder of Registrable Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters, if any, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with similar primary underwritten offerings; and (vi) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Majority Holders and the Managing Underwriters, if any. The foregoing actions set forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this Section 4(p) shall be performed (A) on the effective date of such Registration Statement and each post-effective amendment thereto and (B) at each closing under any underwriting or similar agreement as and to the extent required thereunder.
5. The Company shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof and, in the event of any Shelf Registration Statement, will reimburse the Holders for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm or counsel (in addition to one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) designated by the Majority Holders to act as counsel for the Holders in connection therewith and acceptable to the Company ("Holders' Counsel"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders of the securities being registered and the Exchanging Dealers shall pay all agency or brokerage fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of such securities, the fees and disbursements of any other counsel or other advisors or experts retained by such Holders and Exchanging Dealers (severally or jointly), transfer taxes on resale of any of such securities any advertising expenses incurred by or on behalf of such Holders in connection with any offers they may make.
Registration Expenses.
 
6. (i) In connection with any Registration Statement, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of securities covered thereby (including with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer), the directors and officers, of each such Holder and each other person, if any, who controls any such Holder or Exchanging Dealer within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same degree, upon the same terms and subject to the same conditions as provided in the existing shelf registration statement. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution.
(b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers and each other person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Holder may otherwise have.
(c) The provisions of this Section 6 will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder, the Company or any underwriter or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.
7. . (a) If any of the following events (each a "Registration Default") shall occur, then the Company shall pay certain additional interest ("Special Interest") to the Holders of the series of Securities affected thereby in accordance with Section 7(b):
Registration Defaults and Special Interest
(i) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has not been filed with the Commission on or prior to the 120th day following the date of the original issuance of such Securities;
(ii) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has not been declared effective on or prior to the 225th day following the date of the original issuance of such Securities;
(iii) neither the Registered Exchange Offer with respect to such series of Securities has been completed nor the Shelf Registration Statement with respect to such series of Securities has become effective on or prior to the 270th day following the date of the original issuance of the Securities;
 
(iv) the Exchange Offer Registration Statement with respect to such series of Securities has become effective but ceases to be effective or usable prior to the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer with respect to such series of Securities; or
(v) the Shelf Registration Statement, if applicable, has become effective, but ceases to be effective or usable in connection with resales of the securities covered thereby for a period of time that exceeds 90 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period in which the Company is obligated to maintain the effectiveness thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
(b) Special Interest shall accrue (in addition to stated interest on the affected securities) on the aggregate principal amount of the series of securities affected by the Registration Default from and including the date on which the first such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the affected securities; , , that such rate per annum shall increase by 0.25% per annum from and including the 91st day after the first such Registration Default unless and until all Registration Defaults have been cured. Accrued Special Interest, if any, shall be paid in cash in arrears on each semi-annual interest payment date for the affected securities and the amount of accrued Special Interest shall be determined on the basis of a year consisting of 360 days comprised of twelve 30-day months. Any accrued and unpaid interest (including Special Interest) on any of the Securities shall, upon the issuance of an Exchange Security in exchange therefore cease to be payable to the Holder thereof but such accrued and unpaid interest (including Special Interest) shall be payable on the next interest payment date for such Exchange Security to the Holder thereof on the related record date. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults the accrual of Special Interest will cease, the interest rate will revert to the original rate and, upon any subsequent Registration Default following any such cure of all Registration Defaults, Special Interest will begin accruing again at one quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum and will increase to a maximum of one half of one percent (0.50%) per annum as provided above until all Registration Defaults have been cured. Special Interest shall not be payable with respect to Registration Defaults for any period during which a Shelf Registration Statement is effective and usable by the Holders.
provided
however
The Company shall notify the Trustee within three business days after each and every date on which an event occurs in respect of which Special Interest is required to be paid (an "Event Date"). Special Interest shall be paid by depositing with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of Registrable Securities, on or before the applicable interest payment date, immediately available funds in sums sufficient to pay the Special Interest then due on such interest payment date. Each obligation to pay Special Interest shall be deemed to accrue from and including the day following the applicable Event Date. The Special Interest due is payable to the Holders of record on the applicable record date as set forth in the Indenture.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to pay Special Interest with respect to the Securities to any Holder if the Registration Default arises from the Company' failure to file, or cause to become effective, a Shelf Registration Statement within the time periods specified in this Agreement by reason of the failure of such Holder to provide such information as (i) the Company may reasonably request, with reasonable prior notice, for use in the Shelf Registration Statement or any prospectus included therein to the extent the Company reasonably determines that such information is required to be included therein by applicable law, (ii) the NASD or the Commission may request in connection with such Shelf Registration Statement or (iii) is required to comply with the agreements of such Holder as contained herein to the extent compliance thereof is necessary for the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared or otherwise become effective, including, without limitation, a signed notice and questionnaire as distributed by the Company consenting to such Holder's inclusion in the prospectus as a selling securityholder and providing such further information to the Company as the Company may reasonably request.
8.
Miscellaneous.
(a) The Company has not, as of the date hereof, entered into, nor shall it, on or after the date hereof, enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that limits the rights granted to the Holders herein or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements.
(b) The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Securities (or, after the consummation of any Registered Exchange Offer in accordance with Section 2 hereof, of Exchange Securities). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of securities being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.
Amendments and Waivers.
(c) All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail, facsimile, or air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery:

(i) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8(c), which address initially is, with respect to each Holder, the address of such Holder maintained by the registrar under the Indenture;
 
(ii) if to you, initially at the address set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement; and
(iii) if to the Company, initially at its address set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement.
All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when actually received.
The Trustee or the Company by notice to the other may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications.
(d) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties, including, without the need for an express assignment or any consent by the Company or subsequent Holders of Securities and/or Exchange Securities. The Company hereby agrees to extend the benefits of this Agreement to any Holder of Securities and/or Exchange Securities and any such Holder may specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if an original party hereto.

(h) In the event that any one of more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected thereby, it being intended that all the rights and privileges of the parties shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Severability.
(i) Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of principal amount of Securities or Exchange Securities is required hereunder, Securities or Exchange Securities, as applicable, held by the Company or its Affiliates (other than subsequent Holders of Securities or Exchange Securities if such subsequent Holders are deemed to be Affiliates
Securities Held by the Company, etc.
 
solely by reason of their holdings of such Securities or Exchange Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage.
 
Please confirm that the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement between the Company and you.
 
The foregoing Agreement is hereby confirmed
and accepted as of the date first above written:
 
 
 
 
ANNEX A
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Securities where such Exchange Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, starting on the date hereof (the "Expiration Date") and ending on the close of business on the day that is 90 days following the Expiration Date, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to make this Prospectus, as supplemented or amended, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution."
ANNEX B
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. To date, the SEC has taken the position that broker-dealers may use a prospectus such as this one to fulfill their prospectus delivery requirements with respect to resales of Exchange Securities received in an exchange such as the exchange pursuant to the exchange offer, but only if the old notes for which the Exchange Securities were received in the exchange were acquired for such broker-dealers' own accounts as a result of market-making or other trading activities. Therefore, this Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Securities where such Securities were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, beginning on the Expiration Date and ending on the close of business on the day that is 90 days following the Expiration Date, it will make this Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.
The Company will not receive any proceeds from any sale of Exchange Securities by broker-dealers. Exchange Securities received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the Exchange Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any of the Exchange Securities. Any broker-dealer that resells Exchange Securities pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were received by it for its own account and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Exchange Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resales of such Exchange Securities. Any profit on any such resale of Exchange Securities and any commissions or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act. The Letter of Transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.
The Company has agreed to pay certain expenses incident to the Exchange Offer (other than the expenses of counsel for the holders of the Securities and commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers) and will indemnify the holders of the Exchange Securities (including any broker-dealers) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We note, however, that, in the opinion of the Commission, indemnification agreements for liabilities under the federal securities laws are against public policy and may be unenforceable.
ANNEX C
 
If the undersigned is not a broker-dealer, the undersigned represents that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, a distribution of Exchange Securities. If the undersigned is a broker-dealer that will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, it acknowledges that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities; however, by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, the undersigned will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.
