Alcoa Inc. (Alcoa) hereby amends its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 4, 2007 in order to provide additional details related to the impacts of Alcoa's recent portfolio review decisions in accordance with Item 2.05 and Item 2.06 of Form 8-K.
 
As previously reported on October 4, 2007, Alcoa announced management completed its review of strategic alternatives related to the Electrical and Electronic Solutions business (formerly the Alcoa Fujikura Limited wire harness business) and determined the best course of action is to improve the returns and profitability of this business through a targeted restructuring plan.
In the third quarter of 2007, Alcoa recorded severance charges of $53 million ($36 million after-tax) related to restructurings at various facilities in North America and Europe associated with the Electrical and Electronic Solutions business. Alcoa anticipates recognizing an additional $5 million or less ($4 million after-tax) of costs, such as contract termination costs, retention payments, legal fees and other exit costs, associated with these restructuring actions. The majority of the severance associated with the North American and European facilities is anticipated to be complete by the end of 2008, and the remaining portions of the plan are expected to be complete no later than the first half of 2009. Additionally, Alcoa recorded charges of $207 million ($153 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2007 for the impairment of goodwill and various fixed assets associated with the Electrical and Electronic Solutions business, as the forecasted future earnings and cash flows of this business no longer supported the carrying values of such assets.
 
The information set forth above in Item 2.05, "Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" relating to the impairment charges recorded by Alcoa in the third quarter of 2007 as a result of its decision to restructure its Electrical and Electronic Solutions business is incorporated herein by reference.
As previously reported on October 4, 2007, Alcoa announced management completed its review of strategic alternatives related to the Automotive Castings business and the businesses within the Packaging and Consumer segment, which includes Flexible Packaging, Closure Systems International, Consumer Products, and Food Packaging, and determined the best course of action is to sell these businesses.
In the third quarter of 2007, Alcoa recorded impairment charges of $68 million ($51 million after-tax) related to the Automotive Castings business and $215 million ($140 million after-tax) for the Packaging and Consumer businesses. These impairment charges reflect the write-down of the carrying value of the assets of these businesses to their respective estimated fair values. Also, Alcoa recorded a $464 million income tax charge related to goodwill associated with the Packaging and Consumer businesses that is non-deductible for tax purposes. Severance and other exit costs may be incurred subsequent to the third quarter of 2007 as Alcoa negotiates the sale of these businesses with potential buyers.
