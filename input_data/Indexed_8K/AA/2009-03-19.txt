Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to
such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

6. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
Indemnification and Contribution.
 
which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying
 
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that actual conflicts of interest exist between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there are legal defenses relating to a material aspect of such action available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to control, and otherwise participate in, the defense of such action and the indemnifying party will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending such action as such expenses are incurred.
(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution to liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 11(f) of the Act. Each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the second sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed any of the Registration Statements or any parts thereof and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
7. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities under this Agreement on the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date and the aggregate number of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total number of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date or the applicable Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under this Agreement, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate number of the Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total number of the Securities to be purchased on such date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. In all other cases, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, if any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities under the terms of this Agreement and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
Default of Underwriters.
8. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters under this Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
9. Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that
Certain Agreements of the Underwriters.

Concurrent of Offering of Convertible Notes
Concurrently with this offering of common stock, pursuant to a separate prospectus supplement, we are offering $[            ] million aggregate principal amount of [            ]% convertible notes due 2014 (or $[            ] million aggregate principal amount of [            ]% convertible notes due 2014 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) in an underwritten public offering (the "Convertible Notes Offering"). Neither the completion of this offering nor of the Convertible Notes Offering is contingent on the completion of the other. Assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option with respect to the Convertible Notes Offering, the net proceeds of the Convertible Notes Offering,, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, will be approximately $[            ] million.

Each purchase date must be at least one business date after the written notice is given and may not be earlier than the Closing Date for the Firm Securities nor later than 10 business days after the date of such notice. On each day, if any, that Additional Securities are to be purchased (each, an "Option Closing Date"), each Underwriter agrees to purchase the principal amount of Additional Securities (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional securities as the Representatives determine) that bears the same proportion to the total number of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date as the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name on Schedule I hereto bears to the total principal amount of Firm Securities.
(b) The Representatives have advised the Company that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Securities as soon after this Agreement has become effective as in the judgment of the Representatives is advisable.

The time and date of such payment and delivery are herein referred to as the "Closing Date").
(ii) If the option provided for in Section 3(a)(ii) hereof is exercised after the third business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, payment for any Additional Securities shall be made to the Company in Federal or other funds immediately available
 
in New York City against delivery of such Firm Securities for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date specified in the corresponding notice delivered pursuant to Section or at such other time on the same or on such other date, not later than May 1, 2009, as shall be designated in writing by the Representatives. If an Option Closing Date occurs after the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to the Representatives on each such Option Closing Date, and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Additional Securities shall be conditioned upon receipt of, supplemental opinions, certificates and letters confirming the opinions, certificates and letters delivered on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 5 hereof.
(iii) Delivery of the Firm Securities and the Additional Securities, if any, shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company and shall be in global form unless, in each case, the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.

Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters.
(a) The Representatives shall have received a letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published Rules and Regulations thereunder and stating in effect that:

Prospectus listed in Schedule II hereto, as amended at the date of such letter, comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the related published Rules and Regulations;
(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than five business days prior to the Closing Date, there was any change in the capital stock or any increase in short-term indebtedness or long-term debt of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest available financial information read by such accountants, there was any change in the capital stock or increase in the short-term indebtedness or long-term debt of, the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included in the Registration Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus; or
(B) for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included in the Registration Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus to the closing date of the latest available income statement of the Company read by such accountants there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding amount in the corresponding period of the previous year, in consolidated sales and operating revenues, income from operations, income before extraordinary gains (losses) or income of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, except in all cases set forth in clause (A) above and this clause (B) for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(iii) they have compared certain agreed dollar or tonnage amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar or tonnage amounts) and other financial information contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus listed in Schedule IIA hereto (in each case to the extent that such dollar or tonnage amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries which are subject to the internal controls of the accounting systems of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries, or may be derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar or tonnage amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter.
All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed included in such the Registration Statement and the Preliminary Prospectus for purposes of this subsection.

(d) The Representatives shall have received an opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, of the General Counsel, an Assistant General Counsel or a Counsel of the Company to the effect that:

(v) Neither the execution or delivery by the Company of the Indenture, the Securities, any shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Securities or this Agreement, nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions therein or herein contemplated, nor the fulfillment by the Company of the terms, conditions or provisions thereof or hereof has or will (A) conflict with, violate or result in a breach of any law, administrative regulation or court decree applicable to the Company or (B) conflict with, or result in a breach of, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any agreement or instrument, known to such counsel, to which the Company is a party or by which any of its properties or assets is bound, or constitute a default thereunder;

The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents they reasonably request.
6. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance
Indemnification and Contribution.
 
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that actual conflicts of interest exist between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there are legal defenses relating to a material aspect of such action available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to control, and otherwise participate in, the defense of such action and the indemnifying party will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending such action as such expenses are incurred.
 
(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution to liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 11(f) of the Act. Each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the second sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed any of the Registration Statements or any parts thereof and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
7. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities under this Agreement on the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons,
Default of Underwriters.
 
including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date or the applicable Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under this Agreement, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. In all other cases, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, if any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Securities under the terms of this Agreement and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
8. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters under this Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.

This term sheet to the preliminary prospectus supplement dated March [    ], 2009 should be read together with the preliminary prospectus supplement before making a decision in connection with an investment in the securities. The information in this term sheet supersedes the information contained in the preliminary prospectus supplement to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith.

 If holder elects to convert notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate for the notes surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of our common stock, as described below.
[Adjustment to Conversion Rate upon Certain Fundamental Changes
The following table sets forth the stock price and increase in the conversion rate, expressed as a number of additional shares to be added to the conversion rate:
[INSERT TABLE]
The exact stock price and effective dates may not be set forth on the table, in which case:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of additional shares added to the conversion rate exceed [            ] per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment as described above.]
1
In addition, if a noteholder elects to convert his notes prior to the effective date of any fundamental change, and the fundamental change does not occur, such holder will not be entitled to an increased conversion rate in connection with such conversion.
Our obligation to deliver the additional shares could be considered a penalty, in which case the enforceability thereof would be subject to general principles of reasonableness of economic remedies.
Concurrent Offering of Common Stock
Concurrently with this offering of Convertible Notes, pursuant to a separate prospectus supplement, we are offering [            ] shares ([            ] shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option with respect to that offering in full) of our common stock in an underwritten public offering (the "Common Stock Offering"). Neither the completion of the Common Stock Offering nor the completion of this offering is contingent on the completion of the other. Assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option with respect to the Common Stock Offering, the net proceeds of the Common Stock Offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, will be approximately $[            ] million.
 
 
We have filed a registration statement (including a preliminary prospectus supplement) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the preliminary prospectus supplement included in that registration statement and other documents we have filed with the SEC for more complete information about us and this offering.
