(c)
Indemnification Procedure.
(i) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of written notice of the threat or commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 5, promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim; that the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5 or otherwise, to the extent that the indemnifying party is not prejudiced as a result of such failure.
provided
(ii) In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party notifies an indemnifying party thereof and seeks or intends to seek indemnity from such indemnifying party, such indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in, and to the extent that it may determine, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, to assume, the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; that, if the defendants in any such action include both such indemnified party and such indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict between its position
provided
 
and the position of such indemnifying party with respect to the conduct of the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to such indemnifying party, in each case, such indemnified party shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party. Upon receipt of notice from such indemnifying party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's counsel, such indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense of such action; that the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel of such indemnified party shall be at the expense of such indemnifying party if (A) such indemnified party shall have employed such counsel in connection with the assumption of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the preceding sentence (it being understood that such indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (B) such indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action.
provided
(d)
Contribution.
(i) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any Loss referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such indemnifying party on the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Loss, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and of such indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.
(ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), in no event shall the Manager be required to contribute any amount in excess of the aggregate fees received by the Manager pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
pro
rata
 
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(e) The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any indemnified person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.
(f)  The obligations of the Company and the Manager under this Section 5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the completion of the disposition of the Registrable Securities.
Surviving Obligations.
6.  For such period as the Trust holds any Registrable Securities received pursuant to the Contribution, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file all reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such reasonable further action to the extent required to enable the Manager to sell the Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 144.
Rule 144 Information.
7.  All of the rights and benefits conferred on the Manager pursuant to this Agreement are intended to inure to the benefit of the Trust.
