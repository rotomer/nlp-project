New York, NY, August 9, 2010 
As of the Early Tender Date, which was 5:00 p.m. ET on August 6, 2010, the aggregate principal amount of 2012 Notes tendered and not withdrawn was $188,053,000, representing 36.39% of the $516,709,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2012 Notes outstanding, and the aggregate principal amount of 2013 Notes tendered and not withdrawn was $187,194,000, representing 31.20% of the $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Notes outstanding.
Alcoa also announced today the extension of the previously announced Early Tender Date to coincide with the final expiration of the Maximum Tender Offer. Accordingly, all holders of 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes that are validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to the Maximum Tender Expiration Date, which is 5:00 p.m. ET on August 23, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated, and that are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer, will receive the applicable tender offer consideration plus the applicable early tender premium.
Withdrawal rights in connection with the Maximum Tender Offer expired at the Withdrawal Deadline, which was 5:00 p.m. ET on August 6, 2010. Tendered 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes, whether submitted prior or subsequent to such time, may not be withdrawn.
The Maximum Tender Offer is being made upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated July 26, 2010 and the related Letter of Transmittal.
The Maximum Tender Amount is $484,234,165 in aggregate principal amount, or $750 million less the aggregate purchase price of Alcoa's 6.50% Notes due 2011 accepted for purchase pursuant to the any and all tender offer of its 2011 Notes that expired on August 2, 2010. Alcoa will apply the Maximum Tender Amount first to purchase 2012 Notes and then, to the extent any amount remains, Alcoa will apply the balance to purchase up to an aggregate purchase price of the 2013 Notes equal to the lesser of (i) the remaining Maximum Tender Amount and (ii) $50 million, in each case, subject to proration as applicable.
Payments for 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes purchased in the Maximum Tender Offer will include accrued and unpaid interest from and including the last interest payment date applicable to the relevant series of Notes up to, but not including, the settlement date.
Alcoa's obligation to accept for payment and to pay for the 2012 Notes and 2013 Notes in the Maximum Tender Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the Offer to Purchase related to the Maximum Tender Offer.
