On August 24, 2010, Alcoa Inc. ("Alcoa") issued a press release announcing the expiration and final results of its previously announced tender offer for its outstanding 6.00% Notes due 2012 and 5.375% Notes due 2013. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.
On August 24, 2010, Alcoa elected to redeem all of its outstanding 6.50% Notes due 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $330,055,000. The redemption date is set for September 27, 2010. The redemption price, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the 2011 Notes, will be the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 2011 Notes or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the 2011 Notes, discounted to the redemption date as described in the 2011 Notes, using a reference rate for a comparable U.S. Treasury security plus 20 basis points. In either case, the redemption price will also include accrued and unpaid interest on the 2011 Notes to the redemption date. The reference rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
In the third quarter of 2010, Alcoa expects to recognize an after-tax net loss of approximately $9 million on the early retirement of debt and the associated settlement of interest rate swaps in connection with the completion of the tender offers for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 Notes and the redemption of the remaining outstanding 2011 Notes. Amounts are still being finalized. Additional details will be provided in Alcoa's 2010 third quarter Form 10-Q.
