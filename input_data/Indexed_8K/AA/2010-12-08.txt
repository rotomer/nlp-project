Every person who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise which such person serves or served as such at the request of the Company (hereinafter referred to as an "eligible person") shall in accordance with this Article V, but not if prohibited by law, be indemnified by the Company as hereinafter provided against reasonable expense and any liability paid or incurred by such person in connection with or resulting from any claim in which such person may be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such person's being or having been a director, officer or employee of the Company or such other enterprise, whether or not such person continues to be such at the time such liability or expense shall have been paid or incurred.
Indemnification Granted
Section 2. . As used in this Article V, the term "claim" shall mean any threatened or actual claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether brought by or in the right of the Company or such other enterprise or otherwise), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative; the term "expense" shall mean counsel fees and disbursements and all other expenses (except any liability) incurred in connection with any claim; and the term "liability" shall mean amounts of judgments, fines or penalties against, and amounts paid in settlement by, an eligible person with respect to any claim.
Certain Definitions
Section 3. . Any eligible person who has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, with respect to any claim shall be reimbursed by the Company for such person's reasonable expense. Any eligible person who has been partially successful shall be proportionately reimbursed by the Company for such person's reasonable expense.
Expense Reimbursement to the Extent Successful
Section 4. . Any eligible person who has been partially unsuccessful and any other eligible person not described in Section 3 of this Article V shall be reimbursed by the Company for such person's reasonable expense and for any liability if a Referee shall deliver to the Company the written finding of such Referee that such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company, and in addition with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful.

The termination of any claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), adverse decision, or conviction after trial or upon a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that an eligible person did not meet the foregoing standards of conduct.

appear before the Referee and answer questions which the Referee deems relevant and shall be given ample opportunity to present to the Referee evidence upon which such person relies for indemnification; and the Company shall at the request of the Referee, make available to the Referee facts, opinions or other evidence in any way relevant for the Referee's finding which are within the possession or control of the Company.

The rights of indemnification provided in this Article V shall be in addition to any rights to which any eligible person may otherwise be entitled by contract or as a matter of law; and in the event of such person's death, such rights shall extend to the heirs and legal representatives of such person.
Article V Not Exclusive; Survival of Rights

Share Certificates
Section 2. . The board of directors may from time to time appoint one or more transfer agents and may appoint one or more registrars of transfer, each to act with respect to such preferred and common shares of the Company as the board of directors may designate.

Transfer Agent and Registrar
Section 3. .

Signatures by Former Corporate Officers or Agents
These By-laws may be altered, amended, added to or repealed by the board of directors at any meeting of the board duly convened with or without notice of that purpose, subject to the power of the shareholders to change such action.
 
 
 
Section 1. . Except as prohibited by law, every director of the Company shall be entitled as of right to be indemnified by the Company against expenses and any liability paid or incurred by such person in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding, civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, whether brought by or in the right of the Company or otherwise, in which he or she may be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such person being or having been a director of the Company or by reason of the fact that such person is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or other representative of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other entity (such claim, action, suit or proceeding hereinafter being referred to as a "claim"); provided, that no such right of indemnification shall exist with respect to a claim brought by a director against the Company except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 1. Indemnification hereunder shall include the right to have expenses incurred by such person in connection with a claim paid in advance by the Company prior to final disposition of such claim, subject to any obligation which may be imposed by law, By-law, agreement or otherwise to reimburse the Company in certain events. As used herein, "expenses" shall include fees and expenses of counsel selected by any such director and "liability" shall include amounts of judgments, excise taxes, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement. With respect to any claim brought by a director or other person against the Company, the director or other person shall be entitled to be indemnified for expenses incurred in connection with such claim pursuant to this Section 1 only (i) if the claim is a suit brought as a claim for indemnity under Section 2 of this Article VIII or otherwise, (ii) if the director or other person is successful in whole or in part in the claim for which expenses are claimed or (iii) if the indemnification for expenses is included in a settlement of the claim or is awarded by a court.
Right to Indemnification
Section 2. . If a claim under Section 1 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the Company within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Company, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such suit to recover indemnification that the claimant's conduct was such that under Pennsylvania law the Company is prohibited from indemnifying the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company. Neither the failure of the Company (including its board of directors, legal counsel and its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its board of directors, legal counsel or its shareholders) that the claimant's conduct was such that indemnification is prohibited by law, shall be a defense to the suit to recover indemnification or create a presumption that the claimant's conduct was such that indemnification is prohibited by law. The only defense to any such suit to receive payment of expenses in advance shall be failure to make an undertaking to reimburse if such an undertaking is required by law, By-law, agreement or otherwise.
Right of Claimant to Bring Suit
Section 3. . The Company may purchase and maintain insurance to protect itself and any person eligible to be indemnified hereunder against any liability or expense asserted or incurred by such person in connection with any claim, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability or expense by law or under the provisions of this Article. The Company may create a trust fund, grant a security interest, cause a letter of credit to be issued or use other means (whether or not similar to the foregoing) to ensure the payment of such sums as may become necessary to effect indemnification as provided herein.
Insurance and Funding
 
 
 
Section 4. . The right of indemnification provided for in this Article VIII (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights, whether now existing or hereafter created, to which those seeking indemnification hereunder may be entitled under any provision of the Articles or By-laws, or any agreement, vote of shareholders or directors or otherwise, (ii) shall be deemed to create contractual rights in favor of persons entitled to indemnification hereunder, (iii) shall continue as to persons who have ceased to have the status pursuant to which they were entitled or were denominated as entitled to indemnification hereunder and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of persons entitled to indemnification hereunder and (iv) shall be applicable to claims commenced after the adoption hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after the adoption hereof. The right of indemnification provided for herein may not be amended or repealed so as to limit in any way the indemnification provided for herein with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to any such amendment or repeal.
