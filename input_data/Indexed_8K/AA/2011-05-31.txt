On May 27, 2011, Alcoa Inc. ("Alcoa") elected to redeem all of its outstanding 5.375% Notes due 2013 (the "5.375% Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $283,902,000. The redemption date is set for June 28, 2011. The redemption price, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the 5.375% Notes, will be the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the 5.375% Notes or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the 5.375% Notes, discounted to the redemption date as described in the 5.375% Notes, using a reference rate for a comparable U.S. Treasury security plus 20 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest on the 5.375% Notes to the redemption date. The reference rate will be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
In the second quarter of 2011, Alcoa expects to recognize an after-tax net charge of approximately $30 million on the early retirement of debt and the associated settlement of interest rate swaps in connection with the previously announced completion of the tender offers for the 5.375% Notes and the 6.00% Notes due 2013 and the redemption of the remaining outstanding 5.375% Notes.
