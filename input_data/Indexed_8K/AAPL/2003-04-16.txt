Apple Reports Second Quarter Results
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaApril 16, 2003Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2003 second quarter ended March 29, 2003. For the quarter, the Company posted a net profit of $14 million, or $.04 per diluted share. These results compare to a net profit of $40 million, or $.11 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $1.475 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter, and gross margins were 28.3 percent, up from 27.4 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 47 percent of the quarter's revenues.
Apple shipped 711 thousand Macintosh units during the quarter.
"Our 'year of the notebook' is off to a great start, led by the incredible demand for our new aluminum 12-inch and 17-inch PowerBook G4s," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "This quarter over 40% of the Macs we shipped were notebooksour highest percentage ever and well ahead of the industry average."
"We are very pleased to have achieved our revenue target for the second quarter while maintaining channel inventories under 4.5 weeks," said Fred Anderson, Apple's CFO. "Continued strong asset management enabled us to increase cash to over $4.5 billion. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2003, we expect revenue to be relatively flat with the March quarter and expect a slight profit for the quarter."
