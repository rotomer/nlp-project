iPod Shipments Top 2 million
 
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaOctober 13, 2004Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2004 fourth quarter ended September 25, 2004. For the quarter, the Company posted a net profit of $106 million, or $.26 per diluted share. These results compare to a net profit of $44 million, or $.12 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $2.35 billion, up 37 percent from the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 27.0 percent, up from 26.6 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 37 percent of the quarter's revenue.
 
The quarter's results include an after-tax restructuring charge of $4 million. Excluding this charge, the Company's net profit for the quarter would have been $110 million, or $.27 per diluted share.
 
Apple shipped 836,000 Macintosh units and 2,016,000 iPods during the quarter, representing a 6 percent increase in CPU units and a 500 percent increase in iPods over the year-ago quarter.
 
"We are thrilled to report our highest fourth quarter revenue in nine years," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "We shipped over 2 million iPods, our Retail store revenue grew 95 percent year-over-year, and the new iMac G5 has received phenomenal reviews and is off to a great start."
 
"We're pleased to report 37 percent revenue growth for the quarter and operating margin above 5 percent," said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. "Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we expect revenue of between $2.8 and $2.9 billion, operating margin above 7 percent and earnings per diluted share of $.39 to $.42."
 
For the year, the Company reported net income of $276 million on revenue of $8.28 billion compared to net income of $69 million on revenue of $6.21 billion in 2003.
Non-GAAP Measures
The Company believes that presentation of results excluding items such as restructuring charges and investment gains provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's core operating results and facilitates comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company includes a full income statement reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to provide a more complete view of their effect on results.
