Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Apple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan
On December 14, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") approved participants, performance goals and a bonus formula for fiscal year 2006 under Apple's Performance Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan").
The Committee designated all of Apple's executive officers, other than Apple's Chief Executive Officer, as Bonus Plan participants for fiscal year 2006. The Committee also designated other Apple key employees who are not executive officers as Bonus Plan participants for fiscal year 2006.
As set forth in the Bonus Plan, which was approved by Apple's shareholders at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Committee may choose from a range of defined performance measures.   For fiscal year 2006, the Committee approved two equally-weighted performance measures. These goals relate to Apple achieving certain levels of annual revenue and operating margin.
The target bonus payable under the Bonus Plan for fiscal year 2006 to Apple's executive officers, other than Apple's Chief Executive Officer, is equal to 50% of annual base salary. The maximum bonus payable is equal to 100% of annual base salary. The maximum bonus pool approved for all participants is approximately $6 million.
The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2006 (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Committee. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not increase) the bonus that otherwise would be payable based on actual performance. Each of the Bonus Plan participants must remain an employee for all of fiscal year 2006 in order to be eligible for any bonus.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
