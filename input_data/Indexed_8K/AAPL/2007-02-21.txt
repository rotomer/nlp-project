Bylaws
2.2
                              
Number
The number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of directors shall be eight (8) until changed within the limits specified above, by a bylaw amending this , duly adopted by the Board of Directors or by the shareholders.  The indefinite number of directors may be changed, or a definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite number, by a duly adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by amendment to these Bylaws duly adopted by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided, however, that an amendment reducing the fixed number or the minimum number of directors to a number less

than five (5) cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting of the shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action by written consent, are equal to more than sixteen and two-thirds percent (16-2/3%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum number of authorized directors to a number greater than two (2) times the stated minimum number of directors minus one (1).

Compensation
Directors and members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services, and may be reimbursed for expenses, as fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  This shall not be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation for those services.
Section 2.3
2.4
                              
Election and Term of Office

2.5
                              
Vacancies and Resignations
A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist (i) in the event of the death, resignation or removal of any director, (ii) if the authorized number of directors is increased, (iii) if the shareholders fail, at any meeting of shareholders at which any director or directors are elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be elected at that meeting or (iv) if the Board of Directors declares vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony.
(a)
                                 
Except for a vacancy caused by the removal of a director as provided in of these Bylaws, a vacancy may be filled (i) by a person selected by a majority of the remaining directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum or (ii) by a sole remaining director.  Vacancies created by the removal of a director shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of shares holding a majority of the voting power represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the voting power required to constitute a quorum), or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon.
(b)
                                
Section 2.6
The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a vacancy or vacancies not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by removal, shall require the consent of shares holding a majority of the voting power that are entitled to vote thereon.  A director may not be elected by written consent to fill a vacancy created by removal except by unanimous consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.
(c)
                                 
Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Secretary or the Board of Directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation.  If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the Board of Directors may elect a successor
(d)
                                
2
to take office when the resignation becomes effective.  A reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not remove any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.
2.6
                              
Removal
The entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without cause from office by an affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no director shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be voted cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most recent annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for whom removal is being sought, were then being elected. If any or all directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting or at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares is entitled to elect one (1) or more directors under authority granted by the Articles of Incorporation, the provisions of this shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

Notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the Corporation after either one of the following: (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver two (2) consecutive notices to the shareholder by that means or (ii) the inability to so deliver such notices to the shareholder becomes known to the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of the notice.

Consent to Shareholders' Meetings
The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to approval of contracts between the Corporation and any of its directors, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of the Corporation or winding up the affairs of the Corporation.

Quorum

Shares shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such shares at the meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot be lawfully voted at the meeting.  The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue
11
to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

Adjourned Meetings
Any shareholders' meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in of these Bylaws, in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be transacted at such meeting.  When any meeting of shareholders, either annual or special, is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if its time and place (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the Corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which the shareholders may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than forty-five (45) days or if after adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting.  At any adjourned meeting the shareholders may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

(b)

(a)
                                 
If the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have not been solicited in writing, the Secretary shall give prompt notice of any corporate action approved by the shareholders without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent to those shareholders entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.  Such notice shall be given in the manner specified in of these Bylaws and applicable law.

(c)
                                 
When written consents are given with respect to any shares, they shall be given by and accepted from the persons in whose names such shares stand on the books of the Corporation at the time such respective consents are given, or any shareholder's proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares or a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received by the Corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary, but may not do so thereafter. Such revocation is effective upon its receipt by the Secretary.
(d)
                                
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors; provided that the shareholders may elect a director to fill a vacancy not filled by the
(e)
                                 
13
Board of Directors, other than a vacancy created by removal, by the written consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

Election of Directors
In any election of directors, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal effect.

Proxies
Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one (1) or more agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such person's duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary.  No proxy shall be valid (a) after revocation thereof, unless the proxy is specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this and applicable law, or (b) after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which such proxy is to continue in force. Revocation may be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy. A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless, before the vote is counted, a written notice of such death or incapacity is received by the Corporation.
(a)
                                 
Section 5.12
A proxy which states that it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following: (i) a pledgee, (ii) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of such person's shares in the Corporation to the maker of the proxy, (iii) a creditor or creditors of the Corporation or the shareholder who extended or continued credit to the Corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the proxy if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension or continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing the credit, (iv) a person who has contracted to perform services as an employee of the Corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of employment contracted for or (v) a person designated by or under a close corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement. In addition, a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation secured by it.
(b)
                                
Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of the Corporation or dies, the debt of the Corporation or the shareholder is paid, the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting trust agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, notwithstanding a provision making it
(c)
                                 
14
irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate representing such shares. Every form of proxy or written consent, which provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect to any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate space marked "abstain," whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her shares on the proposal. A proxy marked "abstain" by the shareholder with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for or against such proposal. In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which is marked by a shareholder "withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.

If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the Chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one (1) or more shareholders or proxies, the holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (l) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.  These inspectors shall:

Where the owner of any certificate for shares of the Corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of the original certificate if the owner (a) so requests before the corporation has notice that the original certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, (b) files with the Corporation an indemnity bond in such form and in such amount as shall be approved by the Chief Executive Officer, the President or a Vice President, and (c) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the Corporation. The Board of Directors may adopt such other provisions and restrictions with reference to lost certificates, not inconsistent with applicable law, as it shall in its discretion deem appropriate.  The Board of Directors may require indemnification of the Corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
