EXHIBIT 99.1 News Release [LOGO] AmerisourceBergen Contact: Michael N. Kilpatric 610-727-7118 mkilpatric@amerisourcebergen.com AMERISOURCEBERGEN REPORTS RECORD OPERATING REVENUE AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE MARCH QUARTER Operating Revenue Up 13 percent, and Diluted EPS Up 23 percent VALLEY FORGE, PA, April 24, 2003 -- AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC) today reported record results for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2003. The following results are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Fiscal Second Quarter Highlights . Record diluted earnings per share of $1.03, including special charges of $0.02, up 23 percent. . Record net income of $116.4 million, up 27 percent. . Record operating revenue of $11.2 billion, up 13 percent. . Return On Committed Capital (ROCC) of 26.2 percent. Fiscal First Six Months Highlights . Record diluted earnings per share of $1.87, including special charges of $0.01, up 26 percent. . Record net income of $209.2 million, up 31 percent. . Record operating revenue of $22.3 billion, up 14 percent. "AmerisourceBergen again delivered outstanding performance," said R. David Yost, AmerisourceBergen's Chief Executive Officer. "We had excellent results across all of our businesses. Strong operating revenues in combination with operating expense efficiency drove significant operating margin expansion. This performance combined with solid working capital management resulted in improved return on committed capital and excellent earnings per share."
Discussion of Results Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 were $1.03, a 23 percent increase over the $0.84 in the prior year's second quarter. Included in these results were special charges of $2.4 million, net of tax, in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 for facility consolidations and employee severance and a $2.9 million charge, net of tax, in the same period of the previous fiscal year for merger integration activities. The earnings per share impact of the special charges was a decrease of $0.02 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 and a decrease of $0.03 in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Also in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company wrote down $5.5 million of its equity investment in a technology company, which is included in the "equity in losses of affiliates and other" line in the income statement. AmerisourceBergen's operating revenue, which excludes bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, rose 13 percent to $11.2 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to $9.9 billion for the same period last year. For the first six months of fiscal 2003, diluted earnings per share were $1.87, a 26 percent increase over the $1.48 in the same six-month period last year. Special items related to facility consolidation and employee severance in the first half of fiscal 2003 and merger costs in the first six months of fiscal 2002 resulted in a net decrease in earnings per share of $0.01 and $0.06, respectively. Operating revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2003 increased 14 percent to $22.3 billion from $19.6 billion in the same period of the previous fiscal year. "Our excellent operating performance in the quarter was driven primarily by continued strong merger integration cost savings, excellent growth in our specialty pharmaceuticals business, and contributions from recent acquisitions," said Kurt J. Hilzinger, AmerisourceBergen's President and Chief Operating Officer. "Throughout the period, the building of our new pharmaceutical distribution network continued on time and on budget," he continued. "We consolidated two distribution centers, one in Lynchburg, Virginia, and one in Joplin, Missouri, into other facilities and remain on track to consolidate three more facilities before the end of this fiscal year. We have now consolidated ten distribution centers." "In our PharMerica segment, strong, disciplined operating revenue growth of 10 percent reflects improved growth in both our long term care pharmacy and workers' compensation fulfillment 2
businesses," said Hilzinger. "Continued focus on improved operating practices and customer mix drove operating expenses down and expanded operating margins in the quarter to record levels." Segment Review AmerisourceBergen operates in two segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution (which includes the AmerisourceBergen Drug Company and AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group operations) and PharMerica (which includes the long term care pharmacy and workers' compensation fulfillment businesses). Intersegment sales of $192.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 from AmerisourceBergen Drug Company to PharMerica, which are included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment operating revenue, are eliminated for consolidated reporting purposes. Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment Operating revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 increased to $11.0 billion compared with $9.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2002, a 13 percent increase. Pharmaceutical Distribution customer mix in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 was 55 percent institutional and 45 percent retail. Institutional customers, which include mail order facilities, hospitals and specialty pharmaceutical customers, continued to grow faster than retail customers. Gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was 4.11 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, a 7 basis point improvement over the same period in the prior fiscal year. Higher gross margins were positively impacted by recent acquisitions, which offset the impacts of customer mix and the competitive environment. Total operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 were 2.15 percent, an 8 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year, driven by merger integration cost savings, customer mix, and operating efficiencies, offset in part by higher expense ratios within recent acquisitions. Operating income as a percentage of operating revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 expanded 17 basis points to 1.97 percent compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2002. AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, with annualized revenue of more than $3 billion, continued its strong quarterly performance, building significant positions in oncology, blood plasma, and injectables distribution primarily to physicians, as well as growing its manufacturing services businesses. PharMerica PharMerica's operating revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 10 percent to $397.1 million from $359.8 million in the previous year's second quarter. 3
Gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was 32.35 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, a 117 basis point decline over the same period in the prior fiscal year due primarily to the more rapid growth of the lower gross margin workers' compensation business. The decline in gross margin was more than offset by a 181 basis point improvement in total operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue due primarily to improved operating practices and the change in customer mix. Operating income as a percentage of operating revenue expanded 64 basis points in the quarter ended March 31, 2003 to 6.07 percent from 5.43 percent in the same period of the prior year. Looking Ahead "For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2003, we continue to expect to grow operating revenue approximately 13 percent, with the second half of the fiscal year growing between 11 percent and 12 percent. We continue to expect earnings per share growth of 20 percent for the remainder of fiscal year 2003, excluding the impact of special items and the cost of exercising the call option on the PharMerica bonds in April 2003," said Yost. "ROCC is expected to remain well above our 20 percent long-term target, and we continue to be confident in our ability to achieve annual merger integration cost savings of approximately $150 million by the end of fiscal year 2004, followed by additional cost savings as we complete the build out of our distribution network."

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION EARNINGS PER SHARE (In thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of stock options. Additionally, the diluted earnings per share calculation considers the convertible subordinated notes as if converted and, therefore, the effect of interest expense related to those notes is added back to net income in determining income available to common stockholders.
