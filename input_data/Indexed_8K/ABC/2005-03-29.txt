Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On March 29, 2005, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a news release announcing the settlement of the action initiated in 2004 by the Office of Inspector General ("OIG") of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services against PharMerica Drug Systems, Inc. ("PDSI") and PharMerica, Inc. ("PharMerica"), PDSI's parent and an indirect subsidiary of the Registrant, for alleged violations of federal anti-kickback laws attributable to PDSI's 1997 acquisition of Hollins Manor I, LLC ("HMI"), an institutional pharmacy business. PDSI's acquisition of HMI in 1997 predated both Bergen Brunswig Corporation's acquisition of PharMerica in 1998 and the subsequent merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation and Bergen Brunswig Corporation to form AmerisourceBergen in August 2001. A copy of the news release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 PharMerica, Inc., a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC), today announced a settlement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) regarding all issues related to the OIG's June 2004 administrative action against PharMerica Drug Systems, Inc. (PDSI) and PharMerica for PDSI's 1997 purchase of Hollins Manor I, LLC, a Virginia-based pharmacy.
Valley Forge, PA, March 29, 2005
 
Under the terms of the settlement, PharMerica paid $5.975 million to HHS and entered into a three-year corporate integrity agreement (CIA) with the OIG. In turn, the OIG provided PharMerica and PDSI with a full release for the conduct covered by the administrative action, including an agreement not to pursue the exclusion of PharMerica or PDSI from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or federal healthcare programs. Also as part of the settlement, the Company denied any wrongdoing.
 
The OIG had demanded $21.8 million in damages and penalties from PharMerica and PDSI and the companies' exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs for 10 years.
 
"The settlement allows PharMerica to put this matter from the past behind us," said William Shields, President of PharMerica. "The settlement's emphasis on corporate integrity is consistent with PharMerica's policies and its overriding commitment to quality, compliance and ethical conduct, and does not affect any ongoing business with any customer or payor, including the federal government."
 
The OIG administrative action arose from the 1997 purchase by PDSI, a PharMerica subsidiary, of Hollins Manor I, LLC. There were no allegations of patient harm in the action, which was based on an alleged violation of the Medicare anti-kickback statute resulting from the purchase. The 1997 purchase predated the acquisition of PharMerica by Bergen Brunswig and the subsequent merger that created AmerisourceBergen in 2001.
 
PharMerica, one of the nation's leading pharmacy providers to the long-term care setting, supplies medication and related services to approximately 200,000 nursing home residents in 37 states.
