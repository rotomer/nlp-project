Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
On April 6, 2005, the AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen Corporation ("AmerisourceBergen" or the "Registrant") received a subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (the "NYAG") requesting documents and responses to interrogatories concerning the manner and degree to which the Registrant purchases pharmaceuticals from other wholesalers, often referred to as the alternate source market. AmerisourceBergen, which purchases less than 0.5 percent of the pharmaceuticals it distributes from sources other than the manufacturer, was advised by the NYAG that similar subpoenas have been issued to other industry participants. AmerisourceBergen was not advised of any allegations of misconduct by the Registrant.
 
AmerisourceBergen has been working closely with many manufacturers to minimize the need for pharmaceutical purchases from alternate sources. AmerisourceBergen purchases from alternate sources to maintain high service levels to customers when products are in short supply and in some cases to improve its margin. Purchases in the alternate source market by the Registrant are from less than 20 licensed wholesalers, which must adhere to AmerisourceBergen's product integrity program. AmerisourceBergen's program, which is more stringent than state licensing standards, begins with an extensive application process and background investigation, and includes ongoing monitoring and annual inspections.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
