* eliminate certain events of default contained in the Original Indentures, including those relating to compliance with covenants and representations, defaults under certain secured debt instruments and the entry of certain judgments;
 
* modify the defeasance provision contained in the Original Indentures by simplifying the procedures for defeasance to require only that the Registrant place on deposit an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of all the outstanding notes under the Original Indentures being defeased plus required interest payments and servicing fees; and
 
* modify certain other provisions contained in the Original Indentures, including elimination of the trustee's right to assert certain general remedies and the right of the trustee to bring a suit for collection under the notes issued under the Original Indentures upon a default.
