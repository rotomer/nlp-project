Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
For purposes hereof, the "Registrant" means AmerisourceBergen Corporation.
 
On or about October 7, 2005, an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Registrant's $700 million senior unsecured credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") became fully effective. The Credit Agreement was entered into as of December 2, 2004 among AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant"), JPMorgan Chase, N.A. (as administrative agent), J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC (as co-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners), Bank of America, N.A. (as syndication agent), The Bank of Nova Scotia, Wachovia Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (as documentation agents), and various commercial lenders.
 
The terms of the Amendment relaxed certain covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and provided for the future elimination of certain subsidiary guarantees upon achievement of specified investment grade ratings. The covenants which were relaxed will provide the Registrant with additional flexibility in incurring indebtedness, making foreign acquisitions, making investments and issuing guarantees in connection with its business.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
