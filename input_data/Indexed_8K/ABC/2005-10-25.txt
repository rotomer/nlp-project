Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant") has received notice of termination effective mid-December 2005 of its contract with United Drugs, a group purchasing organization for independent retail pharmacies. Notwithstanding the notice of termination, the Registrant expects to retain a substantial majority of its business with the members of United.
 
The Registrant expects that a large number of the members of United will terminate their affiliation with United and elect to continue to do business with the Registrant. Among other things, the majority of the members of United are participants in one or more of the Registrant's retail programs, including Good Neighbor Pharmacy, Performance Plus Network and Diabetes Shoppe, and a number of them also have separate contracts directly with the Registrant. However, there can be no assurance that the Registrant will retain a majority, or any, of the members of United as customers following the termination of the contract between the Registrant and United.
 
The Registrant believes that United has contracted with a competitor of the Registrant. Purchases by the members of United represented approximately 4% of the Registrant's operating revenues for the nine months ended June 30, 2005.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
