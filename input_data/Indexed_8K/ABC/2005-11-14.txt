On November 10, 2005, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") announced that it raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant") to BBB-' from BB+'. S&P affirmed its A-3' short-term credit rating on the Registrant. S&P's upgrade raised the Registrant to investment grade status. As a result of the upgrade, the Registrant is entitled to substantially relaxed covenants under the indenture governing its 5.625% senior notes due 2012 and 5.875% senior notes due 2015, and to a lesser extent, under its $700 million senior credit facility. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Registrant will no longer be obligated to guarantee the obligations of the Registrant under the senior credit facility or the senior notes.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
