The Board of Directors of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today announced a 100 percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.05 per common share from $0.025 per common share and a two-for-one stock split of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock.
VALLEY FORGE, Pa. November 15, 2005
 
R. David Yost, AmerisourceBergen Chief Executive Officer, said, "The doubling of the dividend and the two-for-one stock split reflect our continued confidence in our performance and our disciplined use of cash to deliver long-term value to our shareholders."
 
For the current quarter, the Company's Board declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share of common stock, payable December 12, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 25, 2005.
 
The split will be in the form of a stock dividend, whereby each stockholder will receive one additional share for each share owned. The new shares will be distributed December 28, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 13, 2005. The Company currently has approximately 104.3 million shares outstanding. After the split, the Company expects to have approximately 208.6 million shares of common stock outstanding, excluding any share repurchase or option exercise activity between now and the split date. As a result of the stock split, future declared quarterly cash dividends are expected to be paid at a rate of $0.025 per common share.
 
AmerisourceBergen reaffirmed its fiscal 2006 expectations of operating revenue growth in the range of 6 percent to 8 percent and diluted earnings per share of between $3.95 and $4.25, $1.98 to $2.13 on a post-split basis. Diluted earnings per share expectations include the impact of a $0.09, $0.045 post-split, charge for equity compensation expense and the anticipation that litigation recovery gains will be offset by facility consolidation and employee severance expense. For fiscal 2006, the Company continues to expect pharmaceutical distribution segment operating margins to be in the range of 115 basis points to 125 basis points, and cash flow from operations to be in the range of $500 million to $600 million.
