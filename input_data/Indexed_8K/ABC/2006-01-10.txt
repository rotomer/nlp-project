Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE:ABC) today will raise its operating revenue growth expectations and reaffirm its previous diluted earnings per share guidance for the December quarter and fiscal year 2006 at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. President and Chief Operating Officer, Kurt J. Hilzinger, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Michael D. DiCandilo, will speak at the conference.
Valley Forge, Pa. January 10, 2006
 
The Company expects the December quarter operating revenue growth to be between 10 percent and 11 percent, due to greater sales to its larger customers in the December quarter. For fiscal year 2006, AmerisourceBergen is raising its operating revenue growth expectations to a range of 7 percent to 9 percent from the previous range of 6 percent to 8 percent.
 
AmerisourceBergen continues to anticipate diluted earnings per share for the December quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.43.
 
The Company also continues to expect diluted earnings per share of between $1.98 and $2.13 for fiscal year 2006. Diluted earnings per share expectations for the fiscal year include the impact of a $0.045 charge for equity compensation expense and the anticipation that expected litigation recovery gains will be offset by facility consolidation and employee severance expense. The Company also reaffirmed that for fiscal year 2006, pharmaceutical distribution segment operating margins are expected to be in the range of 115 basis points to 125 basis points, and cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in the range of $500 million to $600 million.
 
AmerisourceBergen also continues to expect to repurchase approximately $400 to $450 million of its stock by the end of fiscal 2006 under its previously announced $750 million share repurchase authorization.
 
AmerisourceBergen plans to release its results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 on Wednesday, January 25, 2006 prior to the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company will host a conference call to discuss the results at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on January 25, 2006.
