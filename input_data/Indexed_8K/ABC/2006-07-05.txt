Item 8.01. Other Events.
AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant") previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 8, 2006 with the SEC (the "Prior 8-K") that the Registrant had filed a lawsuit on behalf of the long-term care business ("Long-Term Care") of the Registrant's PharMerica reporting segment against Beverly Enterprises, Inc. ("Beverly") and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "Beverly Entities") seeking declaratory judgment and an order requiring the Beverly Entities to abide by the terms and conditions of the existing pharmacy services agreement between Long-Term Care and Beverly.
The Registrant has agreed to delay taking further steps in the lawsuit for a period of time pending negotiation by the parties of a potential agreement that would resolve the dispute and supersede the existing agreement. To assure the continuation of quality care to Beverly's patients, the parties have agreed that they will continue to abide by the terms and conditions of the existing pharmacy services agreement while the negotiations proceed. The parties have agreed to a standstill of their respective legal positions during the negotiations and have agreed that the passage of time during these negotiations will not affect their respective legal positions should they fail to successfully negotiate an agreement.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
