Exhibit 99.1
 
 
AmerisourceBergen Corporation (NYSE: ABC) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Health Advocates, Inc. of Tampa, Florida, for approximately $83 million in cash. Health Advocates is a leading provider of Medicare set-aside cost containment services to insurance payors primarily within the workers' compensation industry. The new business is expected to be slightly accretive to the Company's fiscal 2007 earnings.
Valley Forge, Pa, October 13, 2006 
Health Advocates, with revenues of approximately $20 million over the last 12 months, will be renamed PMSI MSA Services and will operate under PMSI, AmerisourceBergen's workers' compensation services business.
Medicare set-asides are required in certain worker's compensation settlements. The set-asides are funds established to cover future medical and prescription drug expenses incurred as a result of a job-related injury that would have been paid by Medicare. The amount of the set-aside is dependent on a number of complex factors, and ultimately must take Medicare into consideration in order for a workers compensation settlement to be finalized. The purpose of the set-aside is to ensure that Medicare is not burdened with costs that should be covered by the private workers' compensation insurer.
