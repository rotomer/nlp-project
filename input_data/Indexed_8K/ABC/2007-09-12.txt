This report incorporates by reference the information previously reported under Item 8.01 of the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant") on September 6, 2007.
 
The Registrant reported on the status of certain legal proceedings, including the "Bridge Medical Matter" in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth under Item 1 of Part I of the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007 and under Item 8.01 of the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K filed September 6, 2007.
On September 12, 2007, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered a final order and judgment in the matter against the Registrant in the amount of $21 million, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $5.9 million. The amount of prejudgment interest is based on a legal rate of 7% per annum, compounded quarterly, from February 15, 2004. Registrant will record a total charge of $24.6 million, net of income taxes, in discontinued operations in its fourth quarter ending September 30, 2007. The Registrant expects to receive a tax benefit only with respect to interest incurred in this matter by the Registrant. The Registrant believes that the decision of the Delaware Court of Chancery underlying the final order and judgment was in error and intends to appeal the decision.
The Registrant's fiscal 2007 expectations for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations have not been affected by this decision and remain unchanged.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
