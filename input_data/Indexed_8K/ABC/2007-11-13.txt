On November 7, 2007, the Compensation and Succession Planning Committee ("Committee") of the Board of Directors of AmerisourceBergen Corporation ("Registrant") approved performance measures for fiscal year 2008 under the Registrant's annual incentive plan ("AIP"), an annual cash bonus program. Cash bonus awards to the Registrant's named executive officers will depend primarily on the achievement of specified corporate-level and/or business group financial performance measures and secondarily on the achievement of non-financial individual goals. The financial performance measures for fiscal year 2008 include various combinations of the following for each executive officer: earnings per share ("EPS"), return on invested capital and earnings before interest and taxes at the Registrant level and, to the extent applicable for the particular executive officer, earnings before interest and taxes and return on invested capital at the business group level.
The Committee also approved target incentive levels under the AIP for the Registrant's executive officers for fiscal year 2008. Target incentive levels for the named executive officers for fiscal year 2008 range from 100% to 120% of base salary.
The Committee also approved a long-term incentive award for the Registrant's President and Chief Executive Officer, R. David Yost, under the 2002 Management Stock Incentive Plan, as amended. Payout of the incentive award will depend upon the achievement of specified EPS and total stockholder return ("TSR") goals over a three-year performance period, beginning October 1, 2007 and ending September 30, 2010. The Committee approved this award because Mr. Yost's total compensation is substantially below the Committee's target level for him based on the compensation of chief executive officers in the peer group that Registrant uses for purposes of benchmarking executive compensation. The award provides Mr. Yost with the opportunity to earn a cash incentive of $2,700,000 if Registrant meets the target EPS and TSR goals each year over the three-year performance period. The award could pay a maximum achievable bonus of $4,050,000 in the aggregate if we achieve 15% EPS growth and TSR equal to or greater than the 75th percentile relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index each year during the performance period. Any payout of the incentive award is generally subject to Mr. Yost's continuous employment throughout the performance period.
 
On November 8, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Registrant approved amendments to Article II, Section 2.09 of the Registrant's Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws") to change the vote standard for the election of directors from a plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In contested elections where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast. In connection with the change in the required vote for directors, the Board adopted a policy relating to the resignation of directors upon the failure to obtain such required vote and amended the Registrant's Corporate
Governance Principles to include this policy. In accordance with this policy, the Board will only nominate for director, and fill vacancies with, candidates who agree to tender, promptly following the annual meeting at which they are elected or re-elected as director, irrevocable resignations that will be effective upon (i) the failure to receive the required vote at the next annual meeting at which they face re-election and (ii) Board acceptance of such resignation. Under this policy, if an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for re-election, the Registrant's Governance and Nominating Committee will determine whether to accept the director's resignation and will submit its recommendation for prompt consideration by the Board. The Board expects the director whose resignation is under consideration to abstain from participating in any decision regarding his or her resignation. The Board also adopted amendments to Article II, Section 2.03(c) of the Bylaws to require that a stockholder nominating a candidate for director provide the Registrant in advance with a statement as to whether the stockholder's nominee intends to comply with the foregoing policy and, if elected, to tender an irrevocable resignation as described above.
Additionally, in accordance with Article VI, Section 6.01 of the Bylaws, the Board adopted a resolution authorizing newly issued shares of the stock of the Registrant to be uncertificated and approved amendments to Article VI, Sections 6.02 and 6.03 of the Bylaws to allow for the transfer of uncertificated shares and the issuance thereof in the event of lost certificates. By being able to issue uncertificated shares, the Registrant may participate in the Direct Registration System, which is currently administered by The Depository Trust Company. The Direct Registration System allows investors to have securities registered in their names without the issuance of physical certificates and allows investors to electronically transfer securities to broker-dealers in order to effect transactions without the risks and delays associated with transferring physical certificates.
The amended Bylaws are effective as of November 8, 2007 and are attached as Exhibit 3(ii) to this report.
 
On November 8, 2007, the Registrant issued a news release announcing a 50% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.075 per common share of common stock. The quarterly dividend of $0.075 per common share will be payable December 3, 2007 to the stockholders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2007. The Registrant also announced that its Board had authorized a $500 million increase in its existing $850 million share repurchase program. A copy of the news release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 2.05.
Quorum
 
outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Two or more classes or series of stock shall be considered a single class if the holders thereof are entitled to vote together as a single class at the meeting. In the absence of a quorum of the holders of any class of stock entitled to vote on a matter, the meeting of such class may be adjourned from time to time in the manner provided by these Bylaws until a quorum of such class shall be so present or represented. Shares of its own capital stock belonging on the record date for the meeting to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of Directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

The Chairman of the Board shall act as chairman at all meetings of stockholders at which he or she is present, and as such chairman shall call such meetings of stockholders to order and preside thereat. If the Chairman of the Board shall be absent from any meeting of stockholders, the duties otherwise provided in this Section 2.06 to be performed by him or her at such meeting, shall be performed at such meeting by a chairman designated by the Board, or in the absence of such designation, by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary at all meetings of the stockholders, but in his or her absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person present to act as secretary of the meeting.
SECTION 2.06.
Organization
. Prior to any meeting of stockholders, the Board, or a Chairman of the Board designated by the Board, shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting and make a written report thereof and may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at the meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, count all votes and ballots, determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons to assist them in the performance of their duties. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxy or vote, nor any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted therewith, any information provided by a stockholder who submits a proxy by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the proxy was authorized by the stockholder,

Inspectors of Elections
 
ballots and the regular books and record of the Corporation, and they may also consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable information for such purpose, they shall, at the time they make their certification, specify the precise information considered by them, including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors' belief that such information is accurate and reliable.
. The Board may fix a date not more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date of any meeting of stockholders, as a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting and any adjournment thereof, and in such case such stockholders and only such stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid. No record date shall precede the date on which the Board establishes such record date. The Secretary shall prepare and make or cause to be prepared and made, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each such stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place, specified in the notice of the meeting, within the city where the meeting is to be held, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. Such list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.
SECTION 2.08.
Fixing of Record Date
. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. If the Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share on any matter, every reference in these Bylaws to a majority or other proportion of shares of stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such shares of stock. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with a Secretary. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting or the Board.
SECTION 2.09.
Voting; Proxies
 
(a) . Each nominee for Director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for Directors set forth in Article II, Section 2.03(c) of these Bylaws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the day next preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If Directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
Election of Directors
(b) . In all other matters, unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.
Other Action by Stockholders
(c) . Where a separate vote by class or classes is required, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes, except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.
Separate Class Vote
. The stockholders may not take any action without a duly called meeting of the stockholders.
SECTION 2.10.
Action by Stockholders Without a Meeting

The Board may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any committee, including those appointed pursuant to Article IV hereof, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In addition, the Board may exercise all the powers of the Corporation and do all lawful acts and things which are not reserved to the stockholders by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation.

Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting of the Board need be specified in any notice or written waiver of notice unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or by the Bylaws.

No notice of any adjourned meeting need be given other than by announcement at the meeting that is being adjourned. Members of the Board or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or of such committee by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation by a member of the Board in a meeting pursuant to this Section 3.09 of Article III shall constitute his presence in person at such meeting.

SECTION 5.03.
Powers and Duties
 
Board. A Secretary or such other officer appointed to do so by the Board shall have the duty to record the proceedings of the meetings of the stockholders, the Board and any committees in a book to be kept for that purpose. The Board may require any officer, agent or employee to give security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.

SECTION 5.04.
Executive Management Committee
. (a) The shares of stock in the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of the Corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to any such shares represented by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution or resolutions by the Board of the Corporation, every holder of stock represented by certificates, and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or the President or a Vice President, and by a Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, representing the number of shares of stock in the Corporation owned by such holder. If such certificate is manually signed by one or more officers or manually countersigned by a transfer agent or by a registrar, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of such class or series of stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated shares of any class or series of stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required by law to be set forth or stated on certificates representing shares of such class or series or a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of such class or series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall be identical.
. Subject to any restrictions on transfer and unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, shares of stock may be transferred only on the books of the Corporation, if such shares are certificated, by the surrender to the Corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate therefore properly endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment or power of attorney properly executed, with transfer stamps (if necessary) affixed, or upon proper instructions from the holder of uncertificated shares, in each case with such proof of the authenticity of signature as the Corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require.
SECTION 6.02.
Transfers of Stock
. In case any certificate of stock shall be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Board, in its discretion, or any officer or officers thereunto duly authorized by the Board, may authorize the issue of a substitute certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in place of the certificate so lost, stolen or destroyed; provided, however, that, in each such case, the applicant for a substitute certificate or uncertificated shares shall furnish evidence to the Corporation, which it determines in its discretion is satisfactory, of the loss, theft or destruction of such certificate and of the ownership thereof, and also such security or indemnity as may be required by it.
SECTION 6.03.
Lost Certificates

In order to determine the stockholders or other holders of securities entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock or other securities or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of payment of such dividend or other distribution or allotment of such rights or the date when any such rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or securities may be exercised, and in such case only holders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to receive payment of such dividend or other distribution or to receive such
SECTION 6.04.
Determination of Holders of Record for Certain Purposes
 
allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock or other securities on the books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid. No record date shall precede the date on which the Board establishes such record date.
. The Board may provide a suitable Seal containing the name of the Corporation.
SECTION 7.01.
Seal
. The seal of the Corporation shall be in the custody of the Secretary, who shall have power to affix it to the proper corporate instruments and documents, and who shall attest it.

The President, or, in his absence or his disability, any Vice President, may authorize, from time to time, the execution and issuance of proxies to vote shares of stock or other securities of other corporations held of record by the Corporation and the execution of consents to action taken or to be taken by any such corporation. All such proxies and consents, unless otherwise authorized by the Board, shall be signed in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman, the President or any Vice President.
SECTION 8.03.
Execution of Proxies
. Whenever in the Bylaws reference is made to an Article or Section number, such reference is to the number of an Article or Section of the Bylaws. Whenever in the Bylaws reference is made to the Bylaws, such reference is to these Bylaws of the Corporation, as amended, and whenever reference is made to the Certificate of Incorporation, such reference is to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, including all documents deemed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to constitute a part thereof.
SECTION 8.04.
