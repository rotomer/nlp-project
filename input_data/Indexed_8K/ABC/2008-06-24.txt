For purposes hereof, the Registrant means AmerisourceBergen Corporation.
On June 23, 2008, the seventh amendment (the "Seventh Amendment") to the Registrant's $500 million accounts receivables securitization facility became effective. The securitization facility was originally entered into as of July 10, 2003 among Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, as seller, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, as the initial servicer, various financial institutions, as purchasers, and Wachovia Bank, National Association ("Wachovia"), and has been subsequently amended.
The Seventh Amendment increases the base size of the securitization facility from $500 million to $975 million and adds four new purchaser groups to the facility. The securitization facility retains an accordion feature, which permits the commitment to increase by an additional $250 million to $1,225 million for seasonal needs. The Seventh Amendment also provides for the installation of Bank of America, National Association, as the new administrator of the securitization facility, and the resignation of Wachovia, as administrator. The average cost of the securitization facility increased in connection with the increase in commitments under the Seventh Amendment. A copy of the Seventh Amendment is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
