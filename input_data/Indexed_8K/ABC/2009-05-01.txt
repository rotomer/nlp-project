Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
For purposes hereof, the Registrant means AmerisourceBergen Corporation.
On April 30, 2009, the Ninth Amendment (the "Ninth Amendment") to the Registrant's accounts receivables securitization facility (now with a base size of $700 million) became effective. The securitization facility was originally entered into as of July 10, 2003 among Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, as seller, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, as initial servicer, various financial institutions, as purchasers, and the administrator, and has been subsequently amended. Bank of America, National Association, is currently the administrator under the Registrant's securitization facility.
The Ninth Amendment extends the maturity date of the securitization facility and the Registrant chose to reduce the base size of the securitization facility from $975 million to $700 million. The securitization facility retains an accordion feature, which permits commitments under the facility to increase, subject to lender approval, to $950 million for seasonal needs during the December and March quarter. The securitization facility will expire on April 29, 2010. The average cost of the securitization facility was increased in connection with the Ninth Amendment due to current market conditions.
A copy of the Ninth Amendment is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03. Creation of Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information set forth in Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated by reference under this Item 2.03.

Purchase Facility
(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Article VI), from time to time prior to the applicable Facility Termination Date, Seller may request that the Conduit Purchasers, or, if a Conduit Purchaser (in its sole discretion) denies such request or is unable to fund (in which case it shall provide notice of such denial or inability to the Seller, the Administrator and its Purchaser Agent), request that the Related Committed Purchasers, purchase from Seller undivided ownership interests in the Receivables and the associated Related Security and Collections (which interest shall be held by the Administrator on behalf of the applicable Purchasers). Each Conduit Purchaser may (in its sole discretion), and each Related Committed Purchaser severally hereby agrees to, make Incremental Purchases, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof before the applicable Facility Termination Date, ratably based on the applicable Purchaser Group's Ratable
 
Share of each Incremental Purchase requested pursuant to Section 1.2 (and, in the case of each Related Committed Purchaser, its Commitment Percentage of its Purchaser Group's Ratable Share of such Purchase); no Purchase shall be made by any Purchaser if, after giving effect thereto, either (i) if such Purchaser is a Related Committed Purchaser, such Purchaser's aggregate Invested Amount would exceed its Available Commitment, (ii) the Group Invested Amount would exceed the Group Commitment for such Purchaser's Purchaser Group, or (iii) the aggregate of the Receivable Interests would exceed 100%.

If any Purchaser funds or refinances its investment in a Receivable Interest through any means other than the issuance of Commercial Paper, in lieu of paying CP Costs on the Invested Amount pursuant to Article III hereof, Seller will pay Yield thereon at the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with Article IV hereof. Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute a commitment of any Conduit Purchaser to issue Commercial Paper.

The Servicer shall (on or prior to September 30, 2003 with respect to each Collection Account listed on Exhibit IV on the date hereof) effect a Collection Account Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit VI, or if an existing collection account agreement is in place, an amendment and assignment in the form of Exhibit XVII (in each case, with such other changes as the Administrator may otherwise consent), with each bank party to a Collection Account at any time. In the case of any remittances received in any Lock-Box or Collection Account that shall have been identified, to the satisfaction of the Servicer, to not constitute Collections or other proceeds of the Receivables or the Related Security, the Servicer shall promptly remit such items to the Person identified to it as being the owner of such remittances. From and after the date the Administrator delivers to any Collection Bank a Collection Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, the Administrator may request that the Servicer, and the Servicer thereupon promptly shall instruct all Obligors with respect to the Receivables, to remit all payments thereon to a new depositary account specified by the Administrator and, at all times thereafter, Seller and the Servicer shall not deposit or otherwise credit, and shall not permit any other Person to deposit or otherwise credit to such new depositary account any cash or payment item other than Collections.

The Servicer shall, upon the request of the Administrator or any Purchaser Agent and after an Amortization Event or Unmatured Amortization Event, segregate, in a manner acceptable to the Administrator and each Purchaser Agent, all cash, checks and other instruments received by it from time to time constituting Collections from the general funds of the Servicer or Seller prior to the remittance thereof in accordance with Article II. If the Servicer shall be required to segregate Collections pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Servicer shall segregate and deposit with a bank designated by the Administrator such allocable share of Collections of Receivables set aside for each Purchaser on the first Business Day following receipt by the Servicer of such Collections, duly endorsed or with duly executed instruments of transfer.
(d) The Servicer may, in accordance with the Credit and Collection Policy, extend the maturity of any Receivable or adjust the Outstanding Balance of any Receivable as the Servicer determines to be appropriate to maximize Collections thereof; such extension or adjustment shall not alter the status of such Receivable as a Delinquent Receivable or Defaulted Receivable or limit the rights of the Administrator, any Purchaser Agent or any Purchaser under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Required Purchaser Agents shall have the absolute and unlimited right to direct the Servicer to commence or settle any legal action with respect to any Receivable or to foreclose upon or repossess any Related Security.

The Servicer shall, as soon as practicable following receipt thereof turn over to Seller any cash collections or other cash proceeds received with respect to Indebtedness not constituting Receivables. The Servicer shall, from time to time at the request of the Administrator or any Purchaser Agent, furnish to the Administrator and each Purchaser Agent (promptly after any such request) a calculation of the amounts set aside for each Purchaser pursuant to Article II.
(f) Any payment by an Obligor in respect of any indebtedness owed by it to Originator or Seller shall, except as otherwise specified by such Obligor or otherwise required by contract or law and unless otherwise instructed by the Required Purchaser Agents, be applied as a Collection of any Receivable of such Obligor (starting with the oldest such Receivable) to the extent of any amounts then due and payable thereunder before being applied to any other receivable or other obligation of such Obligor.

In case any authorized signatory of Seller whose signature appears on a Collection Account Agreement shall cease to have such authority before the delivery of such notice, such Collection Notice shall nevertheless be valid as if such authority had remained in force. Seller hereby authorizes the Administrator, and agrees that the Administrator shall be entitled (i) at any time after delivery of the Collection Notices, to endorse Seller's name on checks and other instruments representing Collections, (ii) at any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, to enforce the Receivables, the related Contracts and the Related Security, and (iii) at any time after the occurrence of an Amortization Event, to take such action as shall be reasonably necessary or desirable to cause all cash, checks and other instruments constituting Collections of Receivables to come into the possession of the Administrator rather than Seller.

AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (the ) and Recipient have entered into a Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of July 10, 2003 (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the ), pursuant to which Originator, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, is selling and/or contributing its right, title and interest in its accounts receivable to Recipient.
"Originator"
"Sale Agreement"
2. Performance Guarantor owns one hundred percent (100%) of the capital stock of the Originator and Recipient, and Originator, and accordingly, Performance Guarantor, is expected to receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from its sale or contribution of receivables to Recipient pursuant to the Sale Agreement (which benefits are hereby acknowledged).
3. As an inducement for Recipient to acquire Originator's accounts receivable pursuant to the Sale Agreement, Performance Guarantor has agreed to guaranty the due and punctual performance by Originator of its obligations under the Sale Agreement, as well as the Servicing Related Obligations (as hereinafter defined).
4. Performance Guarantor wishes to guaranty the due and punctual performance by Originator of its obligations to Recipient under or in respect of the Sale Agreement and the Servicing Related Obligations (as hereinafter defined), as provided herein.
Performance Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:

"Guaranteed Obligations"
"Receivables Purchase Agreement"
"Agreements"
"Servicing Related Obligations"
 
Section 2. . Performance Guarantor hereby guarantees to Recipient, the full and punctual payment and performance by Originator of its Guaranteed Obligations. This Undertaking is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual performance of all Guaranteed Obligations of Originator under the Agreements and each other document executed and delivered by Originator pursuant to the Agreements and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that Recipient first attempt to collect any amounts owing by Originator to Recipient, the Administrator, any Purchaser Agent or any Purchaser from any other Person or resort to any collateral security, any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of Recipient, the Administrator, any Purchaser Agent or any Purchaser in favor of Originator or any other Person or other means of obtaining payment. Should Originator default in the payment or performance of any of its Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (or its assigns) may cause the immediate performance by Performance Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and cause any payment Guaranteed Obligations to become forthwith due and payable to Recipient (or its assigns), without demand or notice of any nature (other than as expressly provided herein), all of which are hereby expressly waived by Performance Guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Undertaking is not a guarantee of the collection of any of the Receivables and Performance Guarantor shall not be responsible for any Guaranteed Obligations to the extent the failure to perform such Guaranteed Obligations by Originator results from Receivables being uncollectible on account of the insolvency, bankruptcy or lack of creditworthiness of the related Obligor; nothing herein shall relieve Originator from performing in full its Guaranteed Obligations under the Agreements or Performance Guarantor of its undertaking hereunder with respect to the full performance of such duties.
Guaranty of Performance of Guaranteed Obligations

Performance Guarantor further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as a guarantor only, to pay to Recipient (and its assigns), forthwith upon demand in funds immediately available to Recipient, all reasonable costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable legal expenses) incurred or expended by Recipient in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, this Undertaking and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this Undertaking from the time when such amounts become due until payment, at a rate of interest (computed for the actual number of days elapsed based on a 360 day year) equal to the Prime Rate of Bank of America plus 2% , such rate of interest changing when and as such Prime Rate changes.
Performance Guarantor's Further Agreements to Pay
per annum
Section 4. . Performance Guarantor waives notice of acceptance of this Undertaking, notice of any action taken or omitted by Recipient (or its assigns) in reliance on this Undertaking, and any requirement that Recipient (or its assigns) be diligent or prompt in making demands under this Undertaking, giving notice of any Amortization Event, other default or omission by Originator or asserting any other rights of Recipient under this Undertaking. Performance Guarantor warrants that it has adequate means to obtain from Originator, on a continuing basis, information concerning the financial condition of Originator, and that it is not relying on Recipient to provide such information, now or in the
Waivers by Performance Guarantor
 
future. Performance Guarantor also irrevocably waives all defenses (i) that at any time may be available in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations by virtue of any statute of limitations, valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) that arise under the law of suretyship, including impairment of collateral. Recipient (and its assigns) shall be at liberty, without giving notice to or obtaining the assent of Performance Guarantor and without relieving Performance Guarantor of any liability under this Undertaking, to deal with Originator and with each other party who now is or after the date hereof becomes liable in any manner for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, in such manner as Recipient in its sole discretion deems fit, and to this end Performance Guarantor agrees that the validity and enforceability of this Undertaking, including without limitation, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, shall not be impaired or affected by any of the following: (a) any extension, modification or renewal of, or indulgence with respect to, or substitutions for, the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto at any time; (b) any failure or omission to enforce any right, power or remedy with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto, or any collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (c) any waiver of any right, power or remedy or of any Termination Event (as defined in the Receivables Sale Agreement), Amortization Event, or default with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or any agreement relating thereto; (d) any release, surrender, compromise, settlement, waiver, subordination or modification, with or without consideration, of any other obligation of any person or entity with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (e) the enforceability or validity of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof or the genuineness, enforceability or validity of any agreement relating thereto or with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (f) the application of payments received from any source to the payment of any payment obligations of Originator or any part thereof or amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking even though Recipient (or its assigns) might lawfully have elected to apply such payments to any part or all of the payment obligations of Originator or to amounts which are not covered by this Undertaking; (g) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which Performance Guarantor may have at any time against Originator in connection herewith or any unrelated transaction; (h) any assignment or transfer of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; or (i) any failure on the part of Originator to perform or comply with any term of the Agreements or any other document executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder, all whether or not Performance Guarantor shall have had notice or knowledge of any act or omission referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) through (i) of this Section 4.
Section 5. . Notwithstanding (a) any change of ownership of Originator or the insolvency, bankruptcy or any other change in the legal status of Originator; (b) the change in or the imposition of any law, decree, regulation or other governmental act which does or might impair, delay or in any way affect the validity, enforceability or the payment when due of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) the failure of Originator or Performance Guarantor to maintain in full force, validity or effect or to obtain or renew when required all governmental and other approvals, licenses or consents required in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or this Undertaking, or to take any other action required in connection with the performance of all obligations pursuant to the Guaranteed Obligations or this Undertaking; or (d) if any of the moneys included in the Guaranteed Obligations have become irrecoverable from Originator for any other reason other than final payment in full of the payment obligations in accordance with their terms, this Undertaking shall nevertheless be

binding on Performance Guarantor. This Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty or other security for the Guaranteed Obligations, and it shall not be rendered unenforceable by the invalidity of any such other guaranty or security. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Originator or for any other reason with respect to Originator, all such amounts then due and owing with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations under the terms of the Agreements, or any other agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be immediately due and payable by Performance Guarantor.
Section 6. . Performance Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants with, Recipient that:
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
(a) . Performance Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation. Performance Guarantor is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation, and has and holds all corporate power and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted except where the failure to so qualify or so hold could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial conditions or results of operations.
Existence and Standing
(b) . The execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its obligations hereunder, are within its corporate powers and authority and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part. This Undertaking has been duly executed and delivered by Performance Guarantor. This Undertaking constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Performance Guarantor enforceable against Performance Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).
Authorization, Execution and Delivery; Binding Effect
(c) . The execution and delivery by Performance Guarantor of this Undertaking, and the performance of its obligations hereunder, do not contravene or violate (i) its certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws, (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to it, (iii) any restrictions under any agreement, contract or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound, or (iv) any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree binding on or affecting it or its property, and do not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on assets of Performance Guarantor or its Subsidiaries (except as created hereunder) except, in any case, where such contravention or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial conditions or results of operations or result in rendering any indebtedness evidenced thereby due and payable prior to its maturity or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien pursuant to the terms of any such instrument or agreement upon any property (now owned or hereafter acquired).
No Conflict; Government Consent
 
(d) . The consolidated financial statements of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries dated as of December 31, 2002 and March 31, 2003 heretofore delivered to Recipient have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Performance Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for the periods ended on such dates. Since the later of (i) March 31, 2003 and (ii) the last time this representation was made or deemed made, no event has occurred which would or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial conditions or results of operations.
Financial Statements
(e) . Performance Guarantor has filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by Performance Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided. The United States income tax returns of Performance Guarantor have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.

Financial Covenants
Section 7. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, until the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full Performance Guarantor: (a) will not enforce or otherwise exercise any right of subrogation to any of the rights of Recipient, the Administrator, any Purchaser Agent or any Purchaser against Originator, (b) hereby waives all rights of subrogation (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, at law or in equity or otherwise) to the claims of Recipient, the Administrator, each Purchaser Agent and each Purchaser against Originator and all contractual, statutory or legal or equitable rights of contribution, reimbursement, indemnification and similar rights and "claims" (as that term is defined in the Federal Bankruptcy Code) which Performance Guarantor might now have or hereafter acquire against Originator that arise from the existence or performance of Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (c) will not claim any setoff, recoupment or counterclaim against Originator in respect of any liability of Performance Guarantor to Originator and (d) waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral security which may be held by
Subrogation; Subordination
 
Recipient, the Administrator, any Purchaser Agent or any Purchaser. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of Originator now or hereafter owed to Performance Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. Performance Guarantor agrees that, after the occurrence of any default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Performance Guarantor will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such indebtedness of Originator to Performance Guarantor until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid and performed in full. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Performance Guarantor shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness while any obligations are still unperformed or outstanding, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by Performance Guarantor as trustee for Recipient (and its assigns) and be paid over to Recipient (or its assigns) on account of the Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of Performance Guarantor under the other provisions of this Undertaking. The provisions of this Section 7 shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any rights and remedies of Recipient under any separate subordination agreement which Recipient may at any time and from time to time enter into with Performance Guarantor.
Section 8. . Performance Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect until all Aggregate Unpaids are finally paid and satisfied in full and the Receivables Purchase Agreement is terminated; this Undertaking shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or other satisfaction of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of Originator or otherwise, as though such payment had not been made or other satisfaction occurred, whether or not Recipient (or its assigns) is in possession of this Undertaking. No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability by reason of the federal bankruptcy code or any insolvency or other similar law, or any law or order of any government or agency thereof purporting to reduce, amend or otherwise affect the Guaranteed Obligations shall impair, affect, be a defense to or claim against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking.
Termination of Performance Undertaking
provided that
Section 9. . This Performance Undertaking shall survive the insolvency of Originator and the commencement of any case or proceeding by or against Originator under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes. No automatic stay under the Federal Bankruptcy Code with respect to Originator or other federal, state or other applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization statutes to which Originator is subject shall postpone the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking.
Effect of Bankruptcy
Section 10. . Regardless of the other means of obtaining payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, Recipient (and its assigns) is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to Performance Guarantor (any such notice being expressly waived by Performance Guarantor) and to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any deposits and other sums against the obligations of Performance Guarantor under this Undertaking, whether or not Recipient (or any such assign) shall have made any demand under this Undertaking and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured.
Setoff
 
Section 11. . All payments to be made by Performance Guarantor hereunder shall be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding. If Performance Guarantor is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of tax or otherwise from any such payment, the sum due from it in respect of such payment shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding, Recipient receive a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no deduction or withholding been made.
Taxes
Section 12. . Performance Guarantor agrees that it will from time to time, at the request of Recipient (or its assigns), provide information relating to the business and affairs of Performance Guarantor as Recipient may reasonably request. Performance Guarantor also agrees to do all such things and execute all such documents as Recipient (or its assigns) may reasonably consider necessary or desirable to give full effect to this Undertaking and to perfect and preserve the rights and powers of Recipient hereunder.
Further Assurances
Section 13. . This Performance Undertaking shall be binding upon Performance Guarantor, its successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Recipient and its successors and assigns. Performance Guarantor may not assign or transfer any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each of Recipient, the Administrator and each Purchaser Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, Recipient may assign or otherwise transfer the Agreements, any other documents executed in connection therewith or delivered thereunder or any other agreement or note held by them evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or sell participations in any interest therein, to any other entity or other Person, and such other entity or other Person shall thereupon become vested, to the extent set forth in the agreement evidencing such assignment, transfer or participation, with all the rights in respect thereof granted to the beneficiaries herein.
Successors and Assigns
Section 14. . No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Undertaking nor consent to any departure by Performance Guarantor therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Recipient, the Administrator, each Purchaser Agent and Performance Guarantor. No failure on the part of Recipient to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
Amendments and Waivers
Section 15. . All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be addressed as follows: if to Performance Guarantor, at the address set forth beneath its signature hereto, and if to Recipient, at the addresses set forth beneath its signature hereto, or at such other addresses as each of Performance Guarantor or any Recipient may designate in writing to the other.

The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or any other agreement, and this Undertaking shall be in addition to any other guaranty of or collateral security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The provisions of this Undertaking are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of Performance Guarantor hereunder would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of Performance Guarantor's liability under this Undertaking, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Undertaking to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by Performance Guarantor or Recipient, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding. Any provisions of this Undertaking which are prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
