Item 8.01. Other Events.
During a conference call held by the Registrant at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on July 27, 2010, the Registrant announced its preliminary expectations regarding diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011.  The Registrant said that it preliminarily expects a diluted earnings per share growth rate of between 7 percent to 11 percent for fiscal year 2011, which is based on an assumption of diluted earnings per share of $2.13 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010 (the mid-point of the Registrant's guidance of between $2.16 to $2.20 for diluted earnings per share in fiscal year 2010, less a $0.05 gain for special items recognized in fiscal year 2010).  The Registrant also announced that it does not expect sales of the generic pharmaceutical, Oxaliplatin, to contribute the same benefit to fiscal year 2011 diluted earnings per share growth as such sales did to fiscal year 2010 diluted earnings per share.  Underlying the Registrant's fiscal year 2011 expectations, among other things, is the assumption that the loss of earnings from Oxaliplatin sales will be offset in fiscal year 2011 by sales of any remaining Oxaliplatin inventory together with sales of two generic oncology pharmaceuticals, which may be launched in fiscal year 2011.

These and other risks and uncertainties are described herein, in Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 and elsewhere in that report, and in other reports filed by the Registrant pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
