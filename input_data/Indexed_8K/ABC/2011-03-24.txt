Item. 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 18, 2011, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant") and certain of its subsidiaries, Brecon Holdings Limited, Brecon Pharmaceuticals Limited, AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group Canada Corporation and Innomar Strategies, Inc., entered into a $700 million senior unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with the financial institutions party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent.
The Credit Agreement consists of a multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing on March 18, 2015. Borrowings under the revolving facility may be denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Sterling, Euros or, with the consent of the lenders, any alternative currency. Interest on borrowings denominated in US dollars will accrue at either a base rate plus a specified margin or LIBOR plus a specified margin. Interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars will accrue at LIBOR plus a specified margin or Canadian prime rate plus a specified margin. Interest on borrowings denominated in Sterling or any alternative currency will accrue at LIBOR plus a specified margin. Interest on borrowings denominated in Euros will accrue at EURIBOR plus a specified margin. The specified rates are based on the Registrant's debt ratings and range from 0% to .925% over prime or 0.875% to 1.925% over LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable. Swingline loans denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Sterling or Euros will bear interest at a base rate plus a specified margin, the Canadian prime rate, the Sterling overnight rate and the Euro overnight rate, respectively. The revolving facility provides for Bankers' Acceptance borrowings in Canada for which the BA Stamping Fee ranges from 0.875% to 1.925% over a base rate based on the Registrant's debt ratings.
The Registrant may obtain letters of credit under the Revolving Facility up to a maximum amount of US$150 million. The amount of Registrant's outstanding letters of credit (US$11.6 million at March 18, 2011) reduces availability under the Revolving Facility. The Registrant pays participation and fronting fees for outstanding letters of credit. The Registrant pays quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the Revolving Facility at specified rates based on the Ratings ranging from 0.125% to 0.325% of the total commitment under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Registrant, including a covenant requiring compliance with a leverage ratio not to exceed 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. The Registrant may choose to repay its obligations or reduce its commitments under the Credit Agreement at any time. The Registrant's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of its U.S. subsidiaries. The Registrant may use the funds provided under the Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes, permitted investments and permitted acquisitions.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
In connection with the entry into the new $700 million Credit Agreement described in Item 1.01 above, the Registrant terminated its existing multi-currency revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2006 (the "2006 Credit Agreement"), among the Registrant, the borrowing subsidiaries party thereto, JPMorgan Chase, N.A., as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, as London agent, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as Canadian agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto. The 2006 Credit Agreement provided for a $750 million five-year senior unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility on substantially similar terms to the new Credit Agreement but with more favorable pricing. The 2006 Credit Agreement was scheduled to expire on November 14, 2011.

If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit.

Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. A Letter of Credit may provide for automatic renewals for additional periods of up to one year subject to a right on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal from occurring by giving notice to the beneficiary during a specified period in advance of any such renewal, and the failure of such Issuing Bank to give such notice by the end of such period shall for all purposes hereof be deemed an extension of such Letter of Credit; that in no event shall any Letter of Credit, as extended from time to time, expire after the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
Expiration Date
provided
 
(d) . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Tranche One Lender or Tranche Two Lender, as applicable, and each Tranche One Lender or Tranche Two Lender, as applicable, hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Tranche One Percentage or Tranche Two Percentage, as applicable, from time to time of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.

Participations
(e) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement, in the currency of such LC Disbursement, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement; that, in the case of an LC Disbursement in US Dollars or Canadian Dollars, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing or a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing under Section 2.01 or 2.04, as applicable, in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing or Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing. If such Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Tranche One Lender or Tranche Two Lender, as applicable, of the applicable LC Disbursement, the amount and currency of the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Tranche One Percentage or Tranche Two Percentage thereof.

Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
Reimbursement
provided
mutatis
mutandis
 
(f) . Each Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the applicable Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank; that nothing in this Section shall be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
Obligations Absolute

Disbursement Procedures
provided
(h) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement at (i) in the case of any LC Disbursement denominated in US Dollars, the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans denominated in US Dollars and made to the Company, (ii) in the case of any LC Disbursement denominated in Canadian Dollars, the Canadian Prime Rate and (iii) in the case of an LC Disbursement denominated in any other currency, a rate per annum determined by the applicable Issuing Bank (which determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) to represent its cost of funds the Applicable Rate used to determine interest applicable to LIBOR or EURIBOR Revolving Loans; that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(f) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent (which will use reasonable efforts to obtain a return at market rates on any such investments) and at the Borrowers' risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Monies in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate LC Exposures), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents.

Each Tranche One Lender further agrees to retain such records in the manner and for the periods provided in applicable provincial or federal statutes and regulations of Canada and to provide such records to each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary upon its request and at its expense. Upon request by any Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary, a Lender shall cancel all forms of B/A that have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed on behalf of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary and that are held by such Lender and are not required to be issued pursuant to this Agreement.
provided
 
(e) Drafts of each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary to be accepted as B/As hereunder shall be signed as set forth in paragraph (d) above. Notwithstanding that any Person whose signature appears on any B/A may no longer be an authorized signatory for any of the Lenders or such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary at the date of issuance of such B/A, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had remained in force at the time of such issuance and any such B/A so signed and properly completed shall be binding on such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary.
(f) Upon acceptance of a B/A by a Tranche One Lender, such Lender shall purchase such B/A from the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary at the Discount Rate for such Lender applicable to such B/A accepted by it and provide to the Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds for the account of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary as provided in Section 2.07. The acceptance fee payable by the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary to a Lender under Section 2.12 in respect of each B/A accepted by such Lender shall be set off against the Discount Proceeds payable by such Lender under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any B/A Drawing resulting from the conversion or continuation of a B/A Drawing or Revolving Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.08, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to such Borrower by each Lender pursuant to this paragraph will be applied as provided in Section 2.08(f).
(g) Each Tranche One Lender may at any time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all B/As accepted and purchased by it (it being understood that no such sale, rediscount or disposition shall constitute an assignment or participation of any Commitment hereunder).
(h) Each B/A accepted and purchased hereunder shall mature at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto.
(i) Subject to applicable law, each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary waives presentment for payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Tranche One Lender in respect of a B/A accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement that might exist solely by reason of such B/A being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Lender in its own right, and each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Lender as holder sues such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary on the B/A for payment of the amounts payable by such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary thereunder. On the last day of the Contract Period of a B/A, or such earlier date as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall pay the Lender that has accepted and purchased such B/A the full face amount of such B/A, and after such payment such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall have no further liability in respect of such B/A and such Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and be responsible for all payments due to third parties under, such B/A.
(j) At the option of each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary and any Lender, B/As under this Agreement to be accepted by that Lender may be issued in the form of depository bills for deposit with The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited pursuant to the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada). All depository bills so issued shall be governed by the provisions of this Section.
 
(k) If a Tranche One Lender is not a chartered bank under the Bank Act (Canada) or if a Tranche One Lender notifies the Administrative Agent in writing that it is otherwise unable to accept B/As, such Lender will, instead of accepting and purchasing any B/As, make a Loan (a "") to the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary in the amount and for the same term as each draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such Lender will provide to the Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds of such B/A Equivalent Loan for the account of the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary in the same manner as such Lender would have provided the Discount Proceeds in respect of the draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such B/A Equivalent Loan will bear interest at the same rate that would result if such Lender had accepted (and been paid an acceptance fee) and purchased (on a discounted basis) a B/A for the relevant Contract Period (it being the intention of the parties that each such B/A Equivalent Loan shall have the same economic consequences for the Lenders and the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary as the B/A that such B/A Equivalent Loan replaces). All such interest shall be paid in advance on the date such B/A Equivalent Loan is made, and will be deducted from the principal amount of such B/A Equivalent Loan in the same manner in which the Discount Proceeds of a B/A would be deducted from the face amount of the B/A. Subject to the repayment requirements of this Agreement, on the last day of the relevant Contract Period for such B/A Equivalent Loan, the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall be entitled to convert each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another type of Loan, or to roll over each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another B/A Equivalent Loan, all in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
B/A Equivalent Loan
(l) Notwithstanding any provision hereof but subject to Section 2.11(b), the Borrowers may not prepay any B/A Drawing other than on the last day of its Contract Period.
(m) For greater certainty, all provisions of this Agreement that are applicable to B/As shall also be applicable, , to B/A Equivalent Loans.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing or the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan or the applicable Discount Rate and pro-rated acceptance fee, as the case may be.

The applicable Adjusted LIBO Rate, Adjusted EURIBO Rate, Alternate Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.14. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by a majority in interest of the Lenders that would make Loans as part of such Borrowing that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining the Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and the applicable Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the applicable Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, an affected LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing, as the case may be, shall be ineffective, (ii) any affected LIBOR Borrowing or EURIBOR Borrowing that is requested to be continued shall (A) if denominated in US Dollars, be continued as an ABR Borrowing, or (B) otherwise, be repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) any Borrowing Request for an affected LIBOR Borrowing or a EURIBOR Borrowing shall (A) if denominated in US Dollars, be deemed a request for an ABR Borrowing, or (B) otherwise, be ineffective.

(ii) impose on any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the London, European or Canadian interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans or EURIBOR Loans made by or any acceptance and purchase of B/As by such Lender or the funding of such Loans or any Letter of Credit or participations therein; or;
(iii) subject any Credit Party to any Taxes on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than Other Connection Taxes on gross or net income, profits or revenue (including value-added or similar Taxes));
 
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Credit Party of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan or accepting and purchasing any B/As (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to accept and purchase any such B/As) or to increase the cost to such Lender, Issuing Bank or such other Credit Party of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuing Bank or such other Credit Party hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender, Issuing Bank or such other Credit Party, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Issuing Bank or such other Credit Party, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made or B/As accepted and purchased by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, and the manner in which such amount or amounts have been calculated, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error. The Company shall pay or cause the applicable Borrower to pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.16. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan or to make any B/A Drawing on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether any such notice may be revoked or extended under Section 2.11(d) and is revoked or extended in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan or any EURIBOR Loan or the right to receive payment in respect of a B/A other than on the last day of the Interest Period or Contract Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the applicable Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 or the CAM Exchange, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (but not for any lost profit) attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) (A) with respect to a LIBOR Loan or EURIBOR Loan, the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Adjusted EURIBO Rate, as the case may be, that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan) or (B) with respect to a B/A, (x) in the case of an event described in clause (c) above, the face amount of such B/A minus the Discount Proceeds of such B/A and (y) in the case of an event described in clause (d) above, the face amount of such B/A minus amounts received as a result of such assignment over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount or the Discount Proceeds applicable to such B/A for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London, European or Canadian interbank market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. Any payments by the applicable Borrowers in respect of B/As under this section shall be made without duplication of any payment made by any Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary under Section 2.06(i).
Break Funding Payments.
SECTION 2.17. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of a Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Loan Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.
provided
(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d) Each Loan Party shall jointly and severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by the Administrative Agent (for its own account, or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Bank), a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. A copy of such certificate shall also be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
(e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
(f) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower to which such Lender may be required to make Loans hereunder is resident or located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; that such Lender has received written notice from the Company advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and containing all applicable documentation. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(f), the completion, execution and submission of such documentation shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f). Any Lender shall promptly notify the Company at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation to the Company. If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(g), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
(h) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(h), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17(h) to the extent such payment would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or other Person.

(j) If any Governmental Authority shall determine that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Taxes from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or Issuing Bank (whether because such recipient failed to deliver or to complete properly any form or to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that affected its exemption from withholding or for any other reason), such Lender or Issuing Bank shall indemnify the Administrative Agent for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as a result of such determination, including any penalties or interest assessed by such Governmental Authority, and including Taxes imposed on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this subsection, together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto.
 
SECTION 2.18. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements or otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders to such account as the Administrative Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company, except that payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein shall be made directly to such parties and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.20 and 11.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan, B/A or LC Disbursement shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan, B/A or LC Disbursement; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by the Administrative Agent from any Borrower (or from the Company as guarantor of the Obligations of such Borrower pursuant to Article X) and available to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) , towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties and (ii) , towards payment of principal of the Loans and B/As and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of such principal then due to such parties.

(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of its Loans, B/As, participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans or accrued interest on any of the foregoing (collectively "") resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Claims than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Claims of the other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amounts of their respective Claims under such Tranche; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Claims to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company and each Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company or such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Claims
provided
 
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lenders or Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each applicable Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 11.03(c) then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by it for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.19. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or 2.20, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its affected Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or to assign its affected rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15, 2.17 or 2.20, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or 2.20, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 11.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (x) such Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Bank), which consent, in each case, shall not unreasonably be withheld, (y) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and B/As and funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal, funded participations and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (z) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or 2.20 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
 
SECTION 2.20. (a) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan to, or accepting and purchasing any B/A of, or participating in any Letter of Credit or Swingline Loan issued for the account of or made to, any Borrower is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender (or its applicable lending office) is reduced) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Borrower is incorporated in, or conducts business in, a jurisdiction outside the United States of America, the United Kingdom or Canada, such Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent). A certificate of such Lender claiming compensation under this paragraph and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (and the basis for the calculation of such amount or amounts) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
Foreign Subsidiary Costs.
(b) Each Lender will promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge that will entitle such Lender to additional interest or payments pursuant to paragraph (a) above, but in any event within 45 days after such Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof; that (i) if any Lender fails to give such notice within 45 days after it obtains actual knowledge of such an event, such Lender shall, with respect to compensation payable pursuant to this Section in respect of any costs resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section for costs incurred from and after the date 45 days prior to the date that such Lender does give such notice and (ii) each Lender will designate a different applicable lending office, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
provided
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section to the extent the applicable Borrower is a Borrower, and the increased costs for which such Lender is claiming compensation have been or are being incurred at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor was entitled immediately prior to the assignment to such Lender to receive compensation with respect to such increased costs pursuant to this Section.
(d) The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not apply to Taxes applicable to payments made by the Borrowers hereunder or Other Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Section 2.17.
SECTION 2.21. The Company may at any time and from time to time designate any US Subsidiary, UK Subsidiary or Canadian Subsidiary or, with the prior written consent of each Lender, any other Subsidiary, as a Borrower, in each case by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrower Joinder Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and by the Company, and upon such delivery such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Borrower and a party to this Agreement. Any Borrowing Subsidiary shall continue to be a Borrowing Subsidiary until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrower Termination Agreement with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (a) no Borrower Joinder Agreement shall become effective as to any Subsidiary if it shall be unlawful for such Subsidiary to become a Borrower hereunder or for any Lender participating in a Tranche under which such Subsidiary may borrow to make Loans or otherwise extend credit to such Subsidiary as provided herein and (b) no Borrower Termination Agreement will become effective as to any Borrowing Subsidiary until all Loans made to and B/As drawn by such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have been repaid, all Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrowing Subsidiary have been drawn in full or have expired and all amounts payable by such Borrowing Subsidiary in respect of LC Disbursements, interest and/or fees (and, to the extent notified by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any other amounts payable hereunder by such Borrowing Subsidiary) shall have been paid in full; that such Borrower Termination Agreement shall be effective to terminate the right of such Borrowing Subsidiary to request or receive further extensions of credit under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrower Joinder Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.

Any Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.02) and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by it or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through its respective Related Parties, including through its Toronto or London branches, as applicable.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders (in the case of a resignation by the Administrative Agent) shall have the right to appoint a successor, subject (except during the existence of an Event of Default) to the approval of the Company. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank, that is reasonably acceptable to the Company. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After an Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
The parties agree that none of the Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, the Syndication Agents or the Documentation Agents named on the cover page of this Agreement shall, in such capacities, have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
On the CAM Exchange Date, (a) the Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as provided in Article VII, (b) each Lender shall become obligated to fund, within one Business Day, all participations in outstanding Swingline Loans held by it (it being agreed that the CAM Exchange shall not result in a reallocation of such funding obligations, but only of the funded participations resulting therefrom) and (c) the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have made reciprocal purchases of interests in the Designated Obligations such that, in lieu of the interests of each Lender in the particular Designated Obligations that it shall own as of such date and immediately prior to the CAM Exchange, such Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in each Designated Obligation. Each Lender, each person acquiring a participation from any Lender as contemplated by Section 11.04 and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange. Each Borrower and each Lender agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests and obligations of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of any promissory notes so executed and delivered; that the failure of any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
provided
 
As a result of the CAM Exchange, on and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Designated Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages (to be redetermined as of each such date of payment or distribution to the extent required by the next paragraph), but giving effect to assignments after the CAM Exchange Date, it being understood that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all an assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of a single Class of Commitments or Loans.
pro
rata
In the event that, after the CAM Exchange, the aggregate amount of the Designated Obligations shall change as a result of the making of an LC Disbursement of either Tranche by an Issuing Bank that is not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower, then (a) each Lender of such Tranche shall, in accordance with Section 2.05(d), promptly purchase from the applicable Issuing Bank a participation in such LC Disbursement in the amount of such Lender's Tranche One Percentage or Tranche Two Percentage, as the case may be, of such LC Disbursement (without giving effect to the CAM Exchange), (b) the Administrative Agent shall redetermine the CAM Percentages after giving effect to such LC Disbursement and the purchase of participations therein by the applicable Lenders, and the Lenders shall automatically and without further act be deemed to have made reciprocal purchases of interests in the Designated Obligations such that each Lender shall own an interest equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage in each of the Designated Obligations and (c) in the event distributions shall have been made in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Lenders shall make such payments to one another as shall be necessary in order that the amounts received by them shall be equal to the amounts they would have received had each LC Disbursement been outstanding immediately prior to the CAM Exchange. Each such redetermination shall be binding on each of the Lenders and their successors and assigns and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or other obligor of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations, (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement, (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations, (e) any decree or order, or any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or event affecting any term of an Obligation or (f) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation or any other circumstance that might constitute a defense of the Company or any other Borrower or obligor, and any defense arising from the foregoing is hereby waived.
 
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations), and any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise (other than for the indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations) is hereby waived.
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or other obligor or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower or other obligor to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrower or other obligor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower or other obligor to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders.

Agreement
Schedule I
Guarantors
Administrative Agent
Reference is made to the Credit Agreement dated as of March 18, 2011 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the ""), among AmerisourceBergen Corporation, the Borrowing Subsidiaries from time to time party thereto, the Lenders from time to time party thereto and the Administrative Agent. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to it in the Credit Agreement. The Lenders have agreed to extend credit to the Borrowers subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Lenders to extend such credit are conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Guarantor will derive substantial benefits from the extension of credit to the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to execute and deliver this Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to extend such credit.
Credit Agreement
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
SECTION 1. Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment and performance of the Obligations. Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its Guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any Obligation. Each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any other Guarantor of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its Guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
Guarantee.
SECTION 2. Except for termination of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 8 of this Agreement and Sections 11.14 and 11.16 of the Credit Agreement, the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of the each of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations, (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from any of the terms or provisions of, the Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations) or which would impair or eliminate any right of such Guarantor to subrogation. Each Guarantor expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the Obligations, all without affecting the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.
No Limitations.
 
SECTION 3. Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Lender in favor of the Borrowers, any other Loan Party, any other Guarantor or any other Person.
Guarantee of Payment.
SECTION 4. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any other Guarantor or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any other Guarantor, or any decree or order, or any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or event affecting any term of an Obligation, and any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of such Guarantor to subrogation or any other circumstance that might constitute a defense of the Borrowers, any Loan Party or any other Guarantor, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. The Administrative Agent and the other Lenders may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent all the Obligations have been fully and indefeasibly paid in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any other Guarantor, as the case may be, or any security.
Defenses Waived.
SECTION 5. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Lenders may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any Guarantor to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Lenders in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. In addition, any Indebtedness of the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Guarantor on account of (a) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (b) any such Indebtedness of the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any Guarantor, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.
Agreement to Pay; Subordination.
 
SECTION 6.

EXHIBIT F-4
It is not necessary, in order to ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of the Credit Agreement in England:
No United Kingdom ad valorem stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax or issue, documentary, registration or other similar tax imposed by any government department of or in the United Kingdom is or will become payable upon the execution and delivery of the Documents.
 
The execution, delivery and performance by the Companies of the Documents does not conflict with any existing English law or regulation having the force of law in England and Wales applicable to companies generally.
A judgment of a relevant court sitting in the State of New York relating to the relevant Document, provided it is recognised by the English courts as having jurisdiction to give that judgment, should be capable of enforcement by instituting fresh proceedings in the English courts (upon which summary judgment may be obtained) without a retrial or re-examination of the matters thereby adjudicated, provided that a person may have defences open to it and enforcement may not be permitted if, inter-alia:
 
However, in any enforcement proceedings, the defendant may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and refuted in the foreign proceedings.
