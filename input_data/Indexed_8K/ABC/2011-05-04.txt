Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 28, 2011, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Registrant") renewed its $700 million accounts receivables securitization facility for an additional term of three years. The facility termination date of the securitization facility is now scheduled for April 28, 2014.
The securitization facility is available to provide additional liquidity and funding for the ongoing business needs of the Registrant and its subsidiaries. The securitization facility is based on the accounts receivables originated by AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation ("ABDC") for the sale of pharmaceuticals and other related services. Pursuant to the securitization facility, ABDC sells its accounts receivables to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation ("ARFC"). ARFC may sell interests in the accounts receivables purchased from ABDC to the various purchaser groups party to the securitization facility, paying interest on amounts outstanding under the facility. Bank of America, National Association, serves as the administrator of the securitization facility. The securitization facility has a base limit of $700 million, with an option to increase the commitments of the participating banks, subject to their approval, by an additional $250 million for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. The Registrant serves as the performance guarantor of ABDC's obligations as originator and servicer under the securitization facility.
In connection with the renewal, the Registrant or subsidiaries of the Registrant entered into (i) the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2011 (the "First Amendment to RPA"), among ARFC, as seller, ABDC, as initial servicer, various purchaser groups, and Bank of America, National Association, as administrator; (ii) the Second Amendment to Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2011 (the "Second Amendment to RSA"), between ARFC, as buyer, and ABDC, as originator; and (iii) the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Performance Undertaking, dated as of April 28, 2011 (the "First Amendment to Performance Undertaking").
Copies of each of the First Amendment to RPA, Second Amendment to RSA and First Amendment to Performance Undertaking are filed as Exhibit 10.1, Exhibit 10.2 and Exhibit 10.3, respectively, to this report and are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03. Creation of Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
