Fiscal Third Quarter Highlights
Fiscal First Nine Months Highlights
 
"In our June quarter, AmerisourceBergen once again delivered outstanding performance on top of a 36 percent increase in diluted earnings per share in the same quarter last year," said Steven H. Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and Chief Executive Officer. "We had solid results in all of our business units," said Collis. "That performance, combined with better than expected contributions from specialty generics, drove results ahead of expectations in the quarter. In addition, our disciplined approach to working capital management has further strengthened our balance sheet, and we continue to have tremendous financial flexibility. Our results for the quarter and year-to-date continue to demonstrate the value of our two powerful growth drivers  generics and specialty pharmaceuticals."
