Item 8.01. Other Events.
As previously disclosed, two business units of subsidiaries of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Company") are defendants in a pending civil case in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts filed under the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts by a private person, known as a relator, on behalf of the United States and certain state governments.  The relator is a former employee of Amgen Inc., which is also a defendant in the case.
The Company has reached a preliminary agreement for a civil settlement (the Preliminary Settlement) with the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiff states and the relator (collectively, the Plaintiffs) of the pending claims against two business units of subsidiaries of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group: International Nephrology Network, a group purchasing organization for nephrologists and nephrology practices (INN), and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc., which is a distributor of pharmaceuticals to physician practices (ASD).  The Preliminary Settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs, which the Company expects to finalize in fiscal year 2012. The Company does not expect INN or ASD to admit any liability in connection with the settlement.
The Company will record an amount of approximately $16 million in connection with the Preliminary Settlement as a charge to its earnings for the fourth quarter and full year ended September 30, 2011.  This charge was not included in the assumptions underlying the Companys expectations for fiscal year 2011 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.52 to $2.56, which the Company previously announced on July 28, 2011.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
