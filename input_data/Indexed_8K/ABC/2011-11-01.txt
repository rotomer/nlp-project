Fiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights
Fiscal Year 2011 Highlights
 
"Solid results across all of our business units drove excellent performance in the September quarter and in our full fiscal year 2011, resulting in another strong year in a series of very strong years," said Steven H. Collis, AmerisourceBergen President and Chief Executive Officer. "Outstanding performance in the two key growth drivers for our businessgeneric pharmaceuticals and specialty distribution and services, continues to drive gross margin expansion which resulted in significant operating margin expansion for the sixth year in a row. We are confident that our differentiated service and product offerings, our diverse customer base, and our focus on innovation, efficiency and productivity will drive success in the years ahead."
"We continue to generate tremendous cash, and our balance sheet has been further strengthened, which provides great financial flexibility," he continued. "We have deployed that capital to create shareholder value through internal investment and through the recent acquisitions of Premier Source, IntrinsiQ, and the pending acquisition of TheraCom, which we expect to close today. In addition, we have returned significant value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends."
