Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 8, 2011, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among the Company, certain of the Company's direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries named therein (the "Guarantors"), and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, on behalf of themselves and as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"). The Underwriting Agreement provides for the issuance and sale by the Company, and the purchase by the Underwriters, of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.500% Senior Notes due November 15, 2021 (the "Notes"). The Underwriting Agreement contains representations, warranties, conditions and covenants of the parties thereto and provides for indemnification by each of the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters against certain liabilities and contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities. The Company expects to consummate the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters, which is subject to the closing conditions specified in the Underwriting Agreement, on November 14, 2011.
The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will initially be jointly and severally guaranteed (the "Guarantees") on an unsecured basis by the Guarantors. The Guarantors also guarantee the Company's outstanding 5-5/8% Senior Notes due 2012, 5-7/8% Senior Notes due 2015, 4-7/8% Senior Notes due 2019 and the Company's $700 million five-year multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility").
The offer and sale of the Notes and the Guarantees have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-162227) (the "Shelf Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 30, 2009, as amended on November 4, 2009, December 1, 2010 and November 3, 2011.
If the sale of the Notes is consummated pursuant to the terms set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, the Company estimates that it will receive net proceeds of approximately $494.5 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses) from the sale of the Notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, derivative transactions and financial advisory services to the Company and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. Specifically, the Underwriters and their affiliates serve various roles in connection with the Company's Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, including as lenders, administrative agent, syndication agent, co-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. In addition, affiliates of the Underwriters serve various roles in connection with a $700 million receivables securitization facility, including as administrator and purchaser, to which our subsidiary, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (which initially will be a guarantor of the Notes) is a party.
The foregoing is a brief description of certain terms of the Underwriting Agreement and, by its nature, is incomplete. It is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference. The Underwriting Agreement is also filed with reference to, and is hereby made an exhibit to, the Shelf Registration Statement.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On November 8, 2011, the Company issued a news release announcing that it priced $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes in an underwritten registered public offering. The news release is being furnished with this Current Report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Indemnification and Contribution.
(a) . The Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that (i) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, or are caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification of the Underwriters
(b) . Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors and their directors, officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred) that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and
Indemnification of the Company and the Guarantors
 
agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the statements concerning the Underwriters contained in the third paragraph, the third and fourth sentences of the sixth paragraph and the seventh paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" and, with respect to each Underwriter, such Underwriters' name as it appears on the cover.
(c) . If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7 that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) counsel to the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there are or are likely to be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company and the Guarantors, their directors and their officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company and the Guarantors. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from
Notice and Procedures
 
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities and the Guarantees. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
(e) . The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability
(f) . The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies
8. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness of Agreement
 
9. . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
10. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Guarantors on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company and the Guarantors shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons reasonably satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non defaulting Underwriters or the Company and the Guarantors may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company and the Guarantors agree to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company and the Guarantors as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of all Securities to be purchased hereunder, then the Company and the Guarantors shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company and the Guarantors as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities to be purchased hereunder, or if the Company and the Guarantors shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company and the Guarantors, except that the Company and the Guarantors will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11(a) hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
 
(d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company and the Guarantors or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11. . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company and the Guarantors will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the fees and expenses of the Company and the Guarantors' counsel and independent accountants; (iv) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters reasonably incurred in connection therewith); (v) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (vii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; and (viii) all expenses incurred by the Company and the Guarantors in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors. It is understood, however, that except as provided in Section 7, Section 10 or this Section 11, the Underwriters shall pay all of their own costs and expenses, including fees or their counsel.
Payment of Expenses
(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company or the Guarantors for any reason fail to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
12. . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Underwriter referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
13. . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Guarantors and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company and the Guarantors or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company and the Guarantors or the Underwriters.

Each of the Company and the Guarantors has the requisite corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership power and authority, as applicable, necessary to own or hold its properties and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(j) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and each of the Guarantors.
(k) The statements set forth under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities" in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, provide a fair summary of such terms in all material respects and the statements set forth under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to describe certain federal income tax laws and regulations of the United States of America, are accurate in all material respects.

Part 221) or Regulation X (12 C.F.R. Part 224) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
