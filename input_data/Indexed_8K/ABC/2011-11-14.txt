Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 14, 2011, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the "Company") completed the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 3.500% Senior Notes due November 15, 2021 (the "Notes"). The Notes were issued under and are governed by an Indenture, dated as of November 19, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 14, 2011, by and among the Company, certain of the Company's direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries named therein (the "Guarantors") and the Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture").
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.500% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2012. The Notes will mature on November 15, 2021, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to August 15, 2021 at a "make-whole" redemption price set forth in the Supplemental Indenture (which redemption price may not be less than the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) and at any time on or after August 15, 2021 at 100% of the principal amount, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Subject to certain limitations, in the event of a change of control of the Company, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.
The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company and are guaranteed ("Guarantees") on an unsecured basis by each of the Company's current and future U.S. subsidiaries (other than certain excluded non-Guarantor subsidiaries) that have outstanding, or incur or guarantee, certain specified indebtedness. The Guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. As of the issue date of the Notes, Guarantees were provided by each of the Guarantors, which are the same subsidiaries that guarantee the Company's 5

% Senior Notes due 2019 and $700 million five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility. The Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances as specified in the Supplemental Indenture. The Notes are not guaranteed by any of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The Notes and each Guarantee rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company's and the applicable Guarantor's other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. However, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, of the Company's non-Guarantor subsidiaries.
Subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, the Indenture, among other things, limits the Company's ability and the ability of the Company's restricted subsidiaries to create liens and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions and limits the Company's ability to merge or consolidate with or into other entities or to sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of the Company's and its restricted subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole.
The Indenture provides for certain events of default which include (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or warranties in the Indenture; defaults under or failure to pay certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain final judgments; the failure of any Guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, administration or similar proceedings. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee and the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
The foregoing is a brief description of certain terms of the Indenture and, by its nature, is incomplete. It is qualified in its entirety by the text of the Indenture. The Company is filing the Supplemental Indenture as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Base Indenture was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 23, 2009 as Exhibits 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information set forth in Item 1.01 above with respect to the Indenture and the Notes is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03 insofar as it relates to the creation of a direct financial obligation.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
The legal opinion of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP as to the validity of the Notes and the Guarantees is attached as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and such opinion contains the consent of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP to the filing of its opinion as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, Hunton & Williams LLP has also delivered the opinion attached hereto as Exhibit 5.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and such opinion contains the consent of Hunton & Williams LLP to the filing of its opinion as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Subject to this Article 8, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of the 2021 Notes authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Supplemental Indenture, the 2021 Notes and the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:
Section 8.01.
Guarantee.
(a) the principal of and interest on the 2021 Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, redemption, mandatory repurchase or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the 2021 Notes, if any, if
 
lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
(b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any 2021 Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, redemption, mandatory repurchase or otherwise.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.
The Guarantors agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the 2021 Notes or this Supplemental Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the 2021 Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of any Guarantor. Each Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this 2021 Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the 2021 Notes and this Supplemental Indenture.
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this 2021 Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 5.02 of the Base Indenture or Section 3.01 hereof for the purposes of this 2021 Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 5.02 of the Base Indenture or Section 3.01 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this 2021 Note Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the 2021 Note Guarantee.
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of 2021 Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the 2021 Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any 2021 Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of any Guarantor will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 8, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its 2021 Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Section 8.02.
Limitation on Guarantor Liability.
To evidence its 2021 Note Guarantee set forth in Section 8.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such 2021 Note Guarantee substantially in the form included in Exhibit B shall be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each 2021 Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Supplemental Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by its President or one of its Vice Presidents.
Section 8.03.
Execution and Delivery of 2021 Note Guarantee
.
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its 2021 Note Guarantee as set forth in Section 8.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each 2021 Note a notation of such 2021 Note Guarantee.
If an Officer whose signature is on this Supplemental Indenture or on the 2021 Note Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the 2021 Note on which a 2021 Note Guarantee is endorsed, the 2021 Note Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
The delivery of any 2021 Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the 2021 Note Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall cause such Subsidiaries to execute a joinder to this Supplemental Indenture in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto and 2021 Note Guarantees in accordance with this Article 8, to the extent applicable.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.05, no Guarantor may sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person whether or not affiliated with such Guarantor unless:
Section 8.04.
Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.
(a) subject to Section 8.05 hereof, the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than a Guarantor or the Company) unconditionally assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
 
Trustee or by operation of law, under the 2021 Notes, this Supplemental Indenture and the 2021 Note Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein; and
(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by operation of law or by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the 2021 Note Guarantee endorsed upon the 2021 Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Supplemental Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the 2021 Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the 2021 Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the 2021 Note Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Supplemental Indenture as the 2021 Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Supplemental Indenture as though all of such 2021 Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Except as set forth in Articles 8 and 10 of the Base Indenture and Articles 5 and 6 hereof, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Supplemental Indenture or in any of the 2021 Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.
Section 8.05.
Releases.
A Guarantor will be released and relieved of its obligations under the 2021 Note Guarantee upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in this Section 8.05.
(a) In the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of such Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, in each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transactions) a Subsidiary of the Company if, after giving effect to such transaction, neither the Person acquiring such Capital Stock nor such Guarantor has outstanding or guarantees any Specified Indebtedness, then such Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor) will be released and relieved of its obligations under its 2021 Note Guarantee.
(b) In the event the Company designates such Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with this Supplemental Indenture, such Guarantor shall be released and relieved of its obligations under its 2021 Note Guarantee.
 
(c) In the event such Guarantor shall cease (or simultaneously with the release of its Guarantee hereunder shall cease) to have outstanding or guarantee any Specified Indebtedness, such Guarantor shall be released and relieved of its obligations under its 2021 Note Guarantee.
Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture, or upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate to the effect that the applicable Guarantor has ceased (or simultaneously with the release of its 2021 Note Guarantee hereunder shall cease) to have outstanding or guarantee any Specified Indebtedness or that the applicable Guarantor has been designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its 2021 Note Guarantee.
Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its 2021 Note Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the 2021 Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under this Supplemental Indenture as provided in this Article.
