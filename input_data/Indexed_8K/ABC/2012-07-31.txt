Other Events.
 
In connection with AmerisourceBergen Corporation's (the "Registrant's") acquisition of World Courier Group, Inc. ("World Courier") during the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Registrant concluded that World Courier, a separate operating segment, does not meet the criteria to be aggregated with the AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation ("ABDC"), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group ("ABSG"), and AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services ("ABCS") operating segments due to the nature of World Courier's operations and its different revenue growth rates and operating income margins.  As a result and beginning with the June 30, 2012 quarterly reporting period, the Registrant will report the results of its ABDC and ABSG operating segments in the Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment.  The results of operations of the World Courier and ABCS operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure, and therefore will be included in "Other" for the purpose of reportable segment presentation.
 
Attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference into this report, the Registrant has provided unaudited segment financial information for the first three quarters of its 2012 and 2011 fiscal years.  In future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Registrant will include the results of its Pharmaceutical Distribution and Other reportable segments.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
