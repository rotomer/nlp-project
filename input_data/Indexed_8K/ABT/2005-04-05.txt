The following supplements the position taken by the Abbott Laboratories Board of Directors in Abbott's 2005 Proxy Statement with respect to the shareholder proposal set forth as Item 8 in that proxy statement.
 
It has been and continues to be the role of the lead director to review and approve matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other Board members.  The lead director will be chosen by and from the independent members of the Board of Directors, and serves as the liaison between the chairman and the independent directors; however, all directors are encouraged to, and in fact do, consult with the chairman on each of the above topics as well.
