TAP Receives Approvable Letter from FDA on New Drug Application for Febuxostat
 
On Oct. 14, 2005, TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. received an approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the investigational compound febuxostat for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.  TAP is confident it will be able to address the contents of the letter and to obtain final approval for febuxostat in a timely manner.  The new drug application for febuxostat was submitted in December 2004 and was based on a number of studies including the largest Phase III studies of chronic gout patients in the United States to date. This approvable letter has no impact on Abbott's previously stated earnings per share guidance for 2005.
