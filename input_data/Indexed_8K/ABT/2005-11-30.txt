On November 23, 2005, eight of Abbott's direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries entered 30-month credit agreements with various lenders that, in the aggregate, permit borrowings of up to $1.9 billion (dollar equivalent).

The credit agreements allow prepayment and contain other customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, events of default, and restrictions on the borrowers, including limitations on mergers and consolidations and a prohibition on substantially changing the nature of any borrower's business. 
Borrowings under the credit agreements may be used for general corporate purposes, including repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
