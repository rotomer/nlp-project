ABBOTT ANNOUNCES AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT WITH BOSTON SCIENTIFIC TO ACQUIRE GUIDANT'S VASCULAR BUSINESS
 
ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Jan. 17, 2006   Abbott today announced the amendment of its agreement with Boston Scientific to acquire Guidant's vascular business, which is contingent upon the closing of Boston Scientific's proposed acquisition of Guidant.
 
Under the terms of the amended agreement, Abbott would pay Boston Scientific $4.1 billion to acquire Guidant's entire vascular business on or around the closing of Boston Scientific's acquisition of Guidant.  Abbott would pay Boston Scientific milestone payments of $250 million at U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of Guidant's drug-eluting stent, and an additional payment of $250 million upon a similar approval in Japan.  Abbott would also provide Boston Scientific with a five-year, $900 million interest-bearing loan.
Abbott has also agreed to purchase $1.4 billion of Boston Scientific common stock (approximately 56 million shares), contingent upon the closing of the Guidant acquisition. This would represent approximately 4 percent of the combined company.
 
Abbott anticipates the acquisition of Guidant's vascular business would be slightly dilutive to ongoing earnings per share in 2006 and accretive thereafter.  Abbott would expect to incur one-time charges following the closing of the acquisition primarily related to in-process research and development, to be specified at a future date.
