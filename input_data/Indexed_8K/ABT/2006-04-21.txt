Regulation FD Disclosure
 
As discussed in the company's first-quarter earnings announcement on Wednesday, April 19, 2006, Abbott's previous ongoing earnings-per-share guidance for the full-year 2006 was $2.51 to $2.57 and $0.59 to $0.61 for the second quarter, both excluding specified items and the impact of the Guidant vascular acquisition.
 
Abbott expects that the Guidant transaction will be slightly accretive in 2007, improving to at least $0.15 accretion in 2009. As a result of the Guidant transaction, the company anticipates ongoing earnings-per-share dilution of approximately $0.07 per share in 2006, including the impact of non-cash intangible amortization expense. The company expects to incur $0.03 per share of the total dilution in the second quarter of 2006. As a result, Abbott's ongoing earnings-per-share guidance for the full-year 2006 is now $2.44 to $2.50 and $0.56 to $0.58 for the second quarter, both excluding specified items. This forecast conservatively assumes that revenue from an existing co-promotion agreement will not continue after closing. If the agreement continues, dilution in 2006 will be less than $0.07 and accretion in 2007 will be greater.
 
Abbott expects previously announced specified items for the full-year 2006 of $0.05 per share, with $0.01 per share expected in the second quarter. Including the specified items and the impact of the Guidant vascular acquisition, projected earnings per share under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) would be $2.39 to $2.45 for the full-year 2006 and $0.55 to $0.57 for the second quarter. The estimate of specified items excludes one-time charges associated with the Guidant vascular acquisition, which will include acquired in-process R&D expense and integration activities. The company expects to provide estimates of these items by the second-quarter earnings conference call.
