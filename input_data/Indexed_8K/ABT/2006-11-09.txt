Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 5, 2006,  Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") and Abbott's wholly-owned subsidiary, Parthenon Acquisition Corp. f/k/a S&G Nutritionals, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Kos"), pursuant to which Abbott, through Merger Sub, will commence an offer to purchase all the outstanding shares of Kos ("Kos Shares") at a purchase price of $78 per share in cash (the "Offer").  Following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into Kos (the "Merger"). The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the respective parties.
 
Consummation of the Offer and the Merger are subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.  The consummation of the Offer is conditioned on Abbott acquiring a majority of the Kos Shares.  Because the controlling shareholder of Kos, Michael Jaharis, and other shareholders of Kos identified below, who collectively own approximately 53% of the Kos Shares, have committed to tender or otherwise directly or indirectly sell their Kos Shares to Abbott in connection with the Offer, satisfaction of this condition is assured, unless the Kos Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation of the Offer in accordance with the Merger Agreement.  If the Kos Board of Directors withdraws its recommendation, then consummation of the Offer also requires that holders of a majority of the Kos Shares owned by shareholders other than Michael Jaharis and the other shareholders identified below tender their shares to Abbott.
 
Under a Shareholders Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2006 (the "Shareholders Agreement"), among Abbott and Michael Jaharis, Mary Jaharis, Kathryn Jaharis, Steven Jaharis, Wilson Point Holdings, LP, Cubs Management, LLC, Jaharis Holdings, LLC, Steven Jaharis Generational Trust, 2002 Mary Jaharis Grantor Retained Annuity Trust 2, Michael and Mary Jaharis Alaska Community Property Trust, Kathryn Jaharis and Richard Ledes Joint Account, the Jaharis Family Foundation, Inc. and Michael Steven Jaharis Trust 1 (collectively, the "Jaharis Shareholders"), and Kos Investments, Inc. and Kos Holdings, Inc., the Jaharis Shareholders have committed to accept the Offer and to tender all Kos Shares beneficially owned by them, which represents approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Kos.
Concurrently with the closing of the Offer, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 5, 2006, among Abbott, Michael Jaharis, Kathryn Jaharis, Steven Jaharis, Daniel Bell and Steven K. Aronoff (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), Abbott has agreed to purchase 100% of the outstanding stock of Kos Investments, Inc. ("Kos Investments"), which directly and through a wholly owned subsidiary, Kos Holdings, Inc., owns approximately 18% of the Kos Shares.  The total purchase price for Kos Investments will equal the cash amount that would otherwise have
2
 
been payable in the Offer for the Kos Shares owned by Kos Investments minus any liabilities of Kos Investments.
On November 6, 2006, Abbott issued a press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.  The press release is attached as exhibit 99.3.
 
Additional Information
The tender offer described in this report has not yet commenced, and this report is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. At the time the tender offer is commenced, Abbott will file a tender offer statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Investors and Kos security holders are strongly advised to read the tender offer statement (including an offer to purchase, letter of transmittal and related tender offer documents) and the related solicitation/recommendation statement that will be filed by Kos with the SEC, because they will contain important information. These documents will be available at no charge on the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov.

(b)   .  (i) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 7.01 or 7.02, as applicable, in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any person against an Indemnified Party (other than claims relating to Taxes which are subject to clause (a)) (a ""), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party in writing of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by it of written notice of the Third Party Claim (which notice shall include a reasonably summary of the basis for such claim and an estimate of the applicable Loss to the extent then reasonably determinable).  Thereafter, the applicable Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly following receipt by it thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by it from the person asserting the Third Party Claim relating to the Third Party Claim (it being understood that delivery of such notices and documents by one Indemnified Party shall satisfy such obligation for all Indemnified Parties in respect of such notices and documents).

with counsel selected by the indemnifying party; , , that (A) such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the applicable Indemnified Party and (B) the indemnifying party shall not have the right to defend any Third Party Claim that seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief.  If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, each Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense.  The fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Parties for any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof shall be deemed indemnifiable Losses for purposes of Section 7.01.  If the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.  Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.  Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Parties shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms provides for full indemnification of the Indemnified Parties in respect of the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Parties completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnified Parties.

(c)   .  In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim under Section 7.01 or 7.02 that does not involve a Third Party Claim or a claim relating to Taxes (which are subject to clause (a) of this Section 7.05) being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to Sellers or Acquiror, as applicable (which notice shall include a reasonable summary of the basis for such claim and an estimate of the amount of the applicable Loss to the extent then reasonably determinable).   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure or delay in delivering any items contemplated to be delivered to the indemnifying party in respect of any claim pursuant to this paragraph shall only relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations hereunder in respect of such claim to the extent that it is actually prejudiced by such delay.

Exhibit 99.3
ABBOTT PARK, Ill., and CRANBURY, N.J., Nov. 6, 2006  Abbott and Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. today announced a definitive agreement for Abbott to acquire Kos for $78 per share in cash, for a total transaction value of $3.7 billion, net of cash currently held by Kos.  Based in Cranbury, N.J., Kos is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets proprietary medications for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular, metabolic and respiratory diseases.  The company has a growing presence in the $20 billion lipid management market.
"Kos Pharmaceuticals is an excellent strategic fit for Abbott, both scientifically and commercially," said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. "This acquisition expands Abbott's presence in the lipid management market and will provide several on-market and late-stage pipeline products.  Kos also complements our existing commercial and research and development expertise, and increases our R&D spending capacity."
"This is an opportune time to become a part of an organization like Abbott with the shared experience and additional resources to continue our R&D projects and cholesterol products," said Adrian Adams, president and chief executive officer.  "We believe that joining with Abbott will make available greater resources and continued innovation for the benefit of patients and physicians.  Kos Pharmaceuticals, which was founded in 1988 by its current chairman emeritus, Michael Jaharis, and Daniel Bell, its current chairman, and two other employees, pioneered the HDL therapy area in the United States and firmly established Niaspan and Advicor as successful and highly differentiated therapies."
Lipid Management Portfolio
The lipid management market is the single largest pharmaceutical segment and continues to grow at double-digit rates.  Kos Pharmaceuticals' two lead products are Niaspan
, an extended-release niacin product that raises
HDL, or good cholesterol levels
; and Advicor
, a Niaspan/lovastatin combination product that treats patients with multiple lipid disorders.
A new range of Niaspan Caplet Formulation products are currently under U.S. Food and Drug Administration review. Kos is also in late-stage development with Simcor
, a fixed-dose combination of Niaspan and simvastatin (generic Zocor
) to treat
lipid disorders, which is expected to be submitted for regulatory review in the United States in the first half of 2007.  These on-market cholesterol products and development opportunities will join Abbott's lipid management portfolio, which includes on-market TriCor
 a next-generation fenofibrate, ABT-335; and a TriCor/Crestor
 development program with AstraZeneca announced in July 2006.
Other Pipeline Products
Kos Pharmaceuticals is also developing a number of other products, including an asthma medication and an inhaled insulin. Flutiform, currently in late-stage development for adult and adolescent asthma by SkyePharma, will provide an expanded presence for Abbott in the $10 billion asthma market, in addition to Kos' currently marketed asthma product. Kos is also developing an inhaled insulin product, which will complement Abbott's significant presence in the diabetes market  with its leading glucose monitoring and diabetes nutritionals businesses.
Financial Terms
Under the terms of the agreement, Abbott will make a tender offer for all of the outstanding stock of Kos Pharmaceuticals for $78 per share or $3.7 billion, net of cash currently held by Kos.  Abbott expects the addition of Kos to be $0.07 to $0.09 accretive to ongoing earnings per share in 2009 and significantly accretive in 2010 and beyond. In addition, Abbott expects the transaction to be $0.02 to $0.03 dilutive to ongoing earnings per share in 2007 and neutral to accretive in 2008.  Following the closing, the transaction is expected to result in one-time charges, primarily for in-process research and development and integration expenses.
The transaction is structured as a tender offer for all outstanding shares of Kos Pharmaceuticals followed by a merger.  The transaction is subject to customary closing
conditions, including antitrust clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act and acquisition of a majority of the outstanding Kos Pharmaceuticals shares in the tender offer.  Shareholders owning a majority of the shares of Kos Pharmaceuticals' common stock have entered into agreements under which they agreed to tender their shares or have their shares acquired by Abbott.
TriCor Indication and Safety Information
TriCor (fenofibrate tablets) is a lipid-lowering agent used to treat abnormal lipid levels in the bloodstream, including cholesterol and triglycerides.  TriCor is a once-daily treatment available in 145 mg and 48 mg tablets that can be taken with or without food.
TriCor, in addition to appropriate diet, is used to treat adults with high cholesterol, with or without elevated triglycerides (Fredrickson types IIa, IIb). TriCor reduces elevated LDL-C ("bad" cholesterol), total cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, and increases HDL-C ("good" cholesterol).  The effect of TriCor on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and noncardiovascular mortality has not been established. Abbott markets TriCor in the U.S. through an agreement with Solvay Pharmaceuticals.  ABT-335 development is co-funded by Solvay Pharmaceuticals.
TriCor, in addition to appropriate diet, is also used to treat adults with high triglycerides (Fredrickson types IV and V).  Excessive body weight, drinking alcohol, diseases such as diabetes and hypothyroidism, and various drugs can contribute to high triglyceride levels, and these should be assessed before a patient is prescribed TriCor tablets.  TriCor should only be prescribed after reasonable attempts to modify lipid profile with diet modification, exercise and decreased alcohol consumption have failed. It is important for patients to stay on a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol while taking TriCor.
TriCor tablets are not for everyone.  TriCor should not be taken by people with serious liver, kidney or gallbladder disease, or by those who may be allergic or sensitive to the drug.
The combined use of TriCor and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has not been advised because of a potential for serious side effects that could lead to acute renal failure.  The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels needs to be weighed against the increased risks of this drug combination.
TriCor tablets may cause changes in laboratory reports, especially in liver chemistry results.  Regular periodic liver tests should be performed while patients are taking TriCor.  Patients should contact their doctors if they feel pain in the stomach area while taking TriCor, as this can be a sign of gallstones or inflammation of the pancreas.  TriCor may cause muscle pain or serious muscle disease, allergic-type reactions and possible changes in blood chemistry.  If patients experience unexpected muscle pain, tenderness or weakness while taking TriCor, a health-care provider should be contacted immediately.
Patients should notify their doctor if they are taking any other drugs while taking TriCor including any other cholesterol-lowering medications.  TriCor may have an effect on drugs that help prevent blood clotting, such as the blood thinner Coumadin
 (warfarin sodium tablets, USP), and doctors should monitor blood-clotting tests more frequently.
Patients should tell their doctors about any side effects they experience, including breathing problems, back pain and headaches.

Niaspan Indication and Safety Information
Niaspanis the only FDA-approved, once-daily extended-release prescription formulation of niacin for treating abnormal cholesterol levels.  Niaspan is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate, to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, ApoB, and triglyceride levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.  In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia.  Niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease.
Niaspanis contraindicated in patients with allergies to any of its ingredients, active peptic ulcer disease, significant or unexplained persistent liver dysfunction, or arterial bleeding. Niaspanshould not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-
release niacin. Niaspanshould be prescribed with caution in patients who consume substantial amounts of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Liver function tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with Niaspan. Use of Niaspan with other lipid-altering medications called statins may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis, a rare condition that causes muscles to breakdown. The most common side effect with Niaspanis flushing of the skin. Other commonly reported side effects include indigestion, headache, pain, abdominal pain, nausea, itching, diarrhea, running nose, vomiting and rash. Patients with diabetes should carefully monitor their blood sugar and report changes to their doctor.
Advicor Indication and Safety Language
Advicoris a fixed-dose combination product and is not indicated for initial therapy. Advicoris indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone have been inadequate. Advicoris indicated for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in patients who are taking: lovastatin who require additional TG-lowering or HDL-raising who may benefit from having niacin added to their therapy or; niacin who require further LDL-lowering who may benefit from having lovastatin added to their therapy.
Advicoris contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to their components, active liver or peptic ulcer disease, unexplained persistent liver enzyme elevation, arterial bleeding. Advicorshould not be taken by pregnant or nursing women. This product should be prescribed with caution in patients who drink substantial amounts of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Liver function tests should be monitored periodically. Combination therapy with niacin and a statin may increase the risk of myopathy and a serious but rare condition referred to as
rhabdomyolysis. The most common adverse event with Advicoris flushing of the skin. Other commonly reported adverse events include headache, gastrointestinal symptoms and rash. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in blood sugar with these products.
