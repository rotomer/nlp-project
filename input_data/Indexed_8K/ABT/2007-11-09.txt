therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and such counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
In addition, such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent registered public accountants for the Company and the Underwriters and their representatives at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have lead it to believe that (except for financial statements and schedules and other financial and related statistical data as to which such counsel expresses no belief) (i) the Registration Statement (or any post-effective amendment thereto), as of the last time it became effective preceding the time the applicable Pricing Agreement was entered into, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the General Disclosure Package as of the Pricing Effective Time contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), as of its date and as of the Time of Delivery, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(g)           On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading, in the rating accorded the Company, any of the securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;

Indemnity and Contribution
(a)           The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, officers and employees, and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter (within the meaning of the Securities Act), from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, damage, liability, action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities or in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus; and, , ,
provided
however
provided
further
that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to the Prospectus or any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if the Company provides a copy of an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or to a Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as theretofore provided to such Underwriter by the Company (with notice that such amendment or supplement contains additional or different material information from that previously provided) sufficiently far enough in advance of the time of sale in order to enable such Underwriter to convey such amendment or supplement to the purchaser of the Securities, and such amendment or supplement (x) was not conveyed by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person at or prior to the entry into the contract of sale of the Securities by such person, and (y) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense.
(b)           Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any director, officer, employee or controlling person of the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and each Underwriter will reimburse the Company or any director, officer, employee or controlling person of the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or such director, officer, employee or controlling person of the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, damage, liability, action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. 
If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above,
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the
 
other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.  The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e)           The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and employee of any Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.

Defaulting Underwriters

another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary.  The term "" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
Underwriter
(b)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; , , that in no event shall the principal amount of Designated Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 7 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Designated Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter; , , that nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 4(a)(viii) hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 6 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

Termination; Liability
  If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Section 4(a)(viii) and Section 6 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Section 4(a)(viii) and Section 6 hereof.

(i)            They are independent registered public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;
(ii)           In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and any financial statement schedules audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the representative or representatives of the Underwriters (the "");
Representatives
(iii)          The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for the five such fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
(iv)          They have compared the information in the Prospectus under selected captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Items 301, 302, 402 and 503(d), respectively, of Regulation S-K;
(v)           On the basis of performing the procedures specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for a review of interim financial information as described in SAS No. 100, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the periods specified in such letter, and making inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A)          the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related published rules and regulations thereunder or that any material modification should be made to those financial statements for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; and
(B)           any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived.

(A)          the unaudited consolidated financial statements were not stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year, except for the adoption of any required accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or any successor thereof as described in such letter;
(B)           there have been any changes in the consolidated common shares, net of treasury shares (other than incentive stock plan transactions or purchases of common shares authorized for purchase by the Board of Directors) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or net assets or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter;
(C)           there were any decreases in consolidated net sales or operating profit or the total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(D)          any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements.

(A)          as of a specified date not more than four days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated common shares, net of treasury shares (other than incentive stock plan transactions or purchases of common shares authorized for purchase by the Board of Directors) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or net assets or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter;
(B)           for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in clause (A) there were any decreases in consolidated net sales or consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(C)           In addition to the audit referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) through (vii) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
All references in this Annex II to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the
Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Pricing Agreement for purposes of such letter and to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) in relation to the applicable Designated Securities for purposes of the letter delivered at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities.

The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.,

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited initially in aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000.
Abbott may redeem the Securities of this series, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to (1) the greater of (y) 100% of the principal amount of any Security of this series being redeemed or (z) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 20basis points, plus (2) in either case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date on the principal amount of any Security of this series being redeemed.
If the Company has given notice as provided in the Indenture and funds for the redemption of any Securities of this series called for redemption have been made available on the redemption date, such Securities will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for redemption.  Thereafter, the only right of the Holders of such Securities will be to receive payment of the redemption price.
The Company will give notice of any optional redemption to Holders at their addresses, as shown in the Security Register for such Securities, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption.  The notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the redemption price and the principal amount of the Securities of this series held by such Holder to be redeemed.
The Company will notify the Trustee at least 45 days prior to giving notice of redemption (or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee) of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed and their redemption date.  If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select which Securities are to be redeemed in a manner it deems to be fair and appropriate.

Such implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (x) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (y) interpolating linearly between (1) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with a maturity
closest to and greater than the remaining term of those Securities and (2) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with a maturity closest to and less than the remaining term of those Securities.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registerable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of February 9, 2001, as supplemented by a Supplemental Indenture, dated February 27, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and
The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.,
successor in interest to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited initially in aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000.
Abbott may redeem the Securities of this series, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to (1) the greater of (y) 100% of the principal amount of any Security of this series being redeemed or (z) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities being redeemed, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a rate equal to the Treasury Yield (as defined below) plus 30basis points, plus (2) in either case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date on the principal amount of any Security of this series being redeemed.
If the Company has given notice as provided in the Indenture and funds for the redemption of any Securities of this series called for redemption have been made available on the redemption date, such Securities will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for redemption.  Thereafter, the only right of the Holders of such Securities will be to receive payment of the redemption price.
The Company will give notice of any optional redemption to Holders at their addresses, as shown in the Security Register for such Securities, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption.  The notice of redemption will specify, among other items, the redemption price and the principal amount of the Securities of this series held by such Holder to be redeemed.
The Company will notify the Trustee at least 45 days prior to giving notice of redemption (or such shorter period as is satisfactory to the Trustee) of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed and their redemption date.  If less than all of the Securities of this series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select which Securities are to be redeemed in a manner it deems to be fair and appropriate.
"Treasury Yield"
means, with respect to any notes being redeemed, the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported as of the third business day prior to the redemption date, on (a) the Bloomberg Financial Markets News screen PX1 or the equivalent screen provided by Bloomberg Financial Markets News, or (b) if such on-line market data is not at that time provided by Bloomberg Financial Markets News, on the applicable pricing supplement opposite the caption "INVEST RATE" on Reuters on page USAUCTION10 or page USAUCTION11 (or any other page as may replace that page on that service), in any case for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the remaining term of those Securities as of the redemption date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported at that time or the yields reported as of that time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), the Treasury constant maturities yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported at that time, in (a) Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) opposite the caption "U.S. government securities/Treasury bills/secondary market" (or any comparable successor publication) or (b) if not yet published at that time, H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such yield, opposite the caption "U.S. government securities/Treasury bills/secondary market," for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the remaining term of those Securities as of such redemption date. Such implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by (x) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (y) interpolating linearly between (1) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with a maturity
closest to and greater than the remaining term of those Securities and (2) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with a maturity closest to and less than the remaining term of those Securities.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
