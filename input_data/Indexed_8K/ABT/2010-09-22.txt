Item 8.01               Other Events
 
On September 22, 2010, Abbott initiated a proactive, voluntary recall of certain Similac-brand powder infant formulas in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam, and some countries in the Caribbean.  In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the estimated value (approximately $100 million) of the sales returns due to the recall will be treated as a reduction to third quarter 2010 revenue.  Abbott is confirming its previously issued third quarter ongoing earnings-per-share guidance of $1.03 to $1.05 and full-year 2010 ongoing earnings-per-share guidance of $4.13 to $4.18.  The company will incur a one-time specified item in the third quarter 2010 for recall related expenses, including inventory destruction and other recall expenses, to be quantified at a future date.  Abbott has issued a press release informing consumers.
