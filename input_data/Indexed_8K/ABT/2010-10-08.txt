Item 8.01              Other Events
 
On October 8, 2010, Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") announced a voluntary withdrawal of its weight loss product sibutramine in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Abbott is having ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities in countries where sibutramine is marketed and anticipates concluding those discussions in the coming days. Earlier this year, Abbott suspended the marketing of Abbott medicines containing sibutramine in all European Union member countries, as well as Iceland and Norway.  Global sales of sibutramine in the first nine months of 2010 were approximately $80 million, with $20 million of these sales occurring in the U.S.
 
This product withdrawal will not impact Abbott's previously issued ongoing earnings-per-share guidance for the third quarter or full-year 2010.  The company will incur a one-time specified item in the third quarter 2010 related to this action, which will be quantified when third quarter results are reported.
Some statements in this Form 8-K may be forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments.
