On January 14, 2011 Abbott Laboratories withdrew its U.S. biologics license application (BLA) and European marketing authorization application (MAA) for briakinumab (ABT-874), an investigational anti-IL-12/23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of psoriasis. Following feedback from regulatory authorities indicating the need for further analysis and the potential for additional studies, the company plans to evaluate next steps for briakinumab, including resubmission at a later date.
