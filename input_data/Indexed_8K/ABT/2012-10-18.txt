Item 8.01               Other Events
 
On October 17, 2012 Reata Pharmaceuticals informed Abbott that it is discontinuing the Phase 3 clinical study, known as BEACON, designed to evaluate bardoxolone methyl in patients with advanced (stage 4) chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes. The discontinuation is based on a recommendation from the study's Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) regarding safety concerns due to "excess serious adverse events and mortality in the bardoxolone methyl arm."  Regulatory Agencies have been notified of this decision, and study sites and study participants are currently being informed.
 
Reata and Abbott will closely examine the data from this study to determine whether there is an appropriate path forward for the development of bardoxolone methyl in chronic kidney disease or other indications.
 
Abbott has the rights to bardoxolone methyl outside the U.S., excluding certain Asian markets.
