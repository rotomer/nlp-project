AbbVie Indenture and Supplemental Indenture
 
On November 8, 2012, AbbVie Inc. ("AbbVie"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott"), entered into an indenture with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee (the "Trustee") (as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No.1, dated November 8, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), the "Indenture"), relating to the issuance by AbbVie of $3,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.200% senior notes due 2015 (the "Fixed 2015 Notes"), $4,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.750% senior notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.000% senior notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes"), $3,100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.900% senior notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes"), $2,600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.400% senior notes due 2042 (the "2042 Notes" and together with the Fixed 2015 Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the "Fixed Rate Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its floating rate senior notes due 2015 (the "Floating 2015 Notes"). The Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating 2015 Notes are collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Notes," and each of the Fixed 2015 Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2018 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the 2042 Notes and the Floating 2015 Notes, are hereinafter referred to as a "series" of Notes.
 
The Notes, except for $3,037,486,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes (the "Exchanged Notes"), were issued and sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act (the "Private Placement"). The Exchanged Notes were issued by AbbVie to Abbott as partial consideration for the transfer to AbbVie of assets (including interests in intangible assets and stock of subsidiaries) used in connection with the proprietary pharmaceutical business of Abbott and its subsidiaries. Abbott then exchanged the Exchanged Notes with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") in satisfaction and discharge of commercial paper that was previously issued by Abbott to Morgan Stanley. The Exchanged Notes were sold by Morgan Stanley in the Private Placement.
 
Abbott has guaranteed each series of Notes on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, pursuant to a Guarantee, dated as of November 8, 2012, in favor of the Trustee for the holders of the Notes (the "Guarantee"). The Guarantee will terminate upon the previously announced distribution by Abbott of shares of AbbVie common stock to shareholders of Abbott.
 
AbbVie intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes (other than the Exchanged Notes) to make a cash distribution to Abbott, to pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. Abbott intends to use the proceeds it receives from AbbVie, in part, to fund its previously announced cash tender offers for certain of Abbott's outstanding notes.
 
AbbVie may redeem all of the Notes of each series, other than the Floating 2015 Notes, at any time, and some of the Notes of each series, other than the Floating 2015 Notes, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may not redeem the Floating 2015 Notes prior to maturity.
Subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, the Indenture limits AbbVie's ability and the ability of AbbVie's subsidiaries to create or permit to exist mortgages with respect to principal domestic properties and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal domestic properties, and limits AbbVie's ability to merge or consolidate with any other entity or convey, transfer or lease AbbVie's properties and assets substantially as an entirety.
 
The Indenture also provides for certain events of default (subject, in certain cases, to receipt of notice of default and/or customary grace or cure periods), including, but not limited to, (i) failure to pay interest for 30 days, (ii) failure to pay principal when due, (iii) failure to perform, or breach of, any other covenant in the Indenture for 90 days after notice is given by the trustee or the holders of 25% of the outstanding principal amount and (iv) certain specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of AbbVie.
 
Purchase Agreement
 
The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of November 5, 2012, by and among AbbVie, Abbott as Guarantor, Morgan Stanley as Selling Noteholder and Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and the other several purchasers named in Schedule I thereto as Initial Purchasers (the "Initial Purchasers").
 
Registration Rights Agreement
 
On November 8, 2012, AbbVie, Abbott and the Initial Purchasers entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the Notes (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). AbbVie and Abbott agreed under the Registration Rights Agreement to (i) file a registration statement on an appropriate registration form with respect to a registered offer to exchange the Notes for new notes, with terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Notes and (ii) cause the registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act.
 
If the exchange offer is not completed on or before November 4, 2013, AbbVie will use its reasonable best efforts to file and to have declared effective a shelf registration statement relating to the resales of the Notes.
 
If AbbVie fails to satisfy this obligation (a "registration default") under the Registration Rights Agreement, the annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by 0.25%. The annual interest rate on the Notes will increase by an additional 0.25% for each subsequent 90-day period during which the registration default continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00% per year. If the registration default is corrected, the applicable interest rate on the Notes will revert to the original level.
 
If AbbVie must pay additional interest, AbbVie will pay it to the holders of the Notes in cash on the same dates that it makes other interest payments on the Notes, until the registration default is corrected.
 
The preceding is a summary of the terms of the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, the Guarantee and the Registration Rights Agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report, the Supplemental Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.2 to this report, the Guarantee filed as Exhibit 4.3 to this report and the Registration Rights
Agreement filed as Exhibit 4.4 to this report, each of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.  Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification is duly
 
given if it is delivered in person or sent by a national courier service which provides next Business Day delivery or delivery by first-class mail.

If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.

Section 3.3
                                   
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
 
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, an Executive Vice President, a Senior Vice President or a Vice President of the Company.  The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
 
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities.  If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(a)           if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(b)           if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(c)           that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
 
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.1 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
 
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.9, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
Section 3.4

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other
 
variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay.  After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder.  Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.  Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
 
Section 3.5

At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency.  Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the
 
Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any transfer.
 
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Book-Entry Security shall be exchangeable pursuant to this Section 3.5 for Securities registered in the name of Persons other than the Depository for such Security or its nominee only if (i) such Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such Book-Entry Security or if at any time such Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Book-Entry Security shall be so exchangeable or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities.  Any Book-Entry Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in such names as such Depository shall direct.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, a Book-Entry Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository with respect to such Book-Entry Security to a nominee of such Depository or by a nominee of such Depository to such a Depository or another nominee of such Depository.
 
Section 3.6
                                   
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
Defaulted Interest
 
(1)           The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided.  Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days
 
prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment.

Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
 
(2)

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder.  Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.  Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority.  If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.  If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company.  The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company.  Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register.  Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.  No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
 
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

(d)           An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC.  A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.

Upon the termination of such condition, the Company shall promptly proceed with all Suspension Actions that were delayed or suspended and, if required, shall give prompt notice to the Participating Holders of the cessation of the delay or suspension (but not the basis thereof).

Each Holder of Registrable Securities as to which any Shelf Registration is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed so that the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder is not materially misleading and does not omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made.
 
(c)
                                 
Each Participating Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company and the Guarantor of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(a)(vi)(2) or Section 3(a)(vi)(4) hereof, such Participating Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Participating Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(xi) hereof and, if so directed by the Company and the Guarantor, such Participating Holder will deliver to the Company and the Guarantor all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in such Participating Holder's possession, of the Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.
(d)
                                
If the Company and the Guarantor shall give any notice to suspend the disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the Company and the Guarantor shall extend the period during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions or notice that such amendment or supplement is not necessary; , , that no such extension shall be made in the case where such suspension is solely a result of the Company's compliance with Section 3(b) or any other suspension at the request of a Holder.

Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer
.
 
(a)
                                
The Staff has taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account in an Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities (a "") may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Participating Broker-Dealer
 
The Company and the Guarantor understand that it is the Staff's position that if the Prospectus contained in an Exchange Offer Registration Statement includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the Securities Act.
 
(b)
                                
In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor agree to amend or supplement the Prospectus
contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to Section 3(d) hereof), if requested by one or more Participating Broker-Dealers, in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4 above.  The Company and the Guarantor further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law, make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated by this Section 4.
 
(c)
                                 
The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Company, the Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof.

Indemnification and Contribution
.
 
(a)
                                
The Company and, if the Guarantees are registered under any effective Registration Statement, the Guarantor each will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each Holder, their respective directors, officers and employees, each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities, joint or several, to which such Initial Purchaser, Holder, director, officer, employee, controlling person or affiliate may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" ("") filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, and will reimburse each such Initial Purchaser, Holder, director, officer, employee, controlling person or affiliate for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchaser, Holder, director, officer, employee, controlling person or affiliate in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, damage, liability, action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company and the Guarantor shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any Initial Purchaser or any Holder furnished to the Company and the Guarantor in writing by such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives or by such Holder expressly for use therein.
Issuer Information

(b)
                                
Each Holder will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, the Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers and the other selling Holders, the directors, officers and employees of the Company, the Guarantor, and the Initial Purchasers, each Person, if any, who controls the Company, the Guarantor, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling
Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act)
and each affiliate of any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, the Guarantor, or such Initial Purchaser, other selling Holder, director, officer, employee,
controlling person or affiliate
may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) that arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, any Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any Free Writing Prospectus
, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any
Registration Statement, any Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any Free Writing Prospectus
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Holder;
and each Holder will reimburse
the Company, the Guarantor, and such Initial Purchaser, other selling Holder, director, officer, employee,
controlling person and affiliate in connection with investigating, or defending any such loss, damage, liability, action or claim as such expenses are incurred, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in
any
Registration Statement, any Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus

(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party except to the extent such omission materially prejudices the indemnifying party.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
 
(d)
                                
To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein (or actions in respect thereof), then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor from the offering of the Securities or Exchange Securities, on the one hand, and the Holders from receiving Securities or Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnifying
party failed to give notice required under paragraph (c) of this Section 5, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Holders on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or such Holder on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e)
                                 
The Company, the Guarantor and the Holders agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and not joint.
pro rata
 
(f)
                                  
The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
 
(g)
                                 
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or any Holder, any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder or any
affiliate of any Initial Purchaser, or
by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantor, their officers or directors or any Person controlling the Company or the Guarantor, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5 to the contrary, the Guarantor shall have no liability under this Section 5 to any indemnified party if the Guarantees have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee Agreement prior to the time any Registration Statement has become effective.

Each Holder of Registrable Securities outstanding at the time of any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent thereafter shall be bound by any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent effected pursuant to this Section 6(b), whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent appears on the Registrable Securities or is delivered to such Holder.

Majority of Holders
.  Whenever an action or determination under this Agreement requires a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable holders, in determining such majority, if the Company shall issue any additional Securities under the Indenture prior to consummation of the Exchange Offer or, if applicable, the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration Statement, then such additional Securities and the Registrable Securities to which this Agreement relates shall be treated together as one class for purposes of determining whether the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of Registrable Securities has been obtained.

(f)
                                  
Third Party Beneficiaries. 
Each Holder shall be a third party beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder between the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of other Holders hereunder.
