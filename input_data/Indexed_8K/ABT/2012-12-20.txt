Item 4.01.  Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
 
(a) 
Dismissal of Independent Registered Public Accountant
 
On December 14, 2012, the Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories (the "Company") approved the dismissal of Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the Company's independent registered public accountant, effective as of the date of Deloitte's completion of the audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 and the filing of the Company's 2013 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.
 
The reports of Deloitte on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle, and included explanatory paragraphs.  The 2011 report included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's change to the year end of its foreign subsidiaries and change to its presentation of comprehensive income during 2011.  The 2010 report included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's adoption of a new accounting standard in 2009.
 
During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and through December 14, 2012, the date of Deloitte's dismissal, (i) there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte would have caused Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
 
The Company has provided Deloitte with a copy of this Form 8-K and requested that Deloitte provide the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not Deloitte agrees with the above disclosures. A copy of Deloitte's letter, dated December 20, 2012, is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
(b) 
Newly Appointed Independent Registered Public Accountant
 
On December 14, 2012, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit services beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014. During the Company's fiscal years ending December 31, 2011 and 2010 and through December 14, 2012, neither the Company, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted Ernst & Young regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, in any case where a written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Ernst & Young that Ernst & Young concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
