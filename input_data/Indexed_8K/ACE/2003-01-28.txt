Exhibit 99.1 ACE LIMITED TO STRENGTHEN ASBESTOS RESERVES: WILL RESULT IN $354 MILLION NET AFTER-TAX CHARGE TO FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS COMPANY PROVIDES UPDATED GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE FOURTH QUARTER HAMILTON, Bermuda--Jan. 27, 2003--ACE Limited (NYSE:ACE) reported today that it will incur a net, after-tax charge to earnings of $354 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. This decision follows an extensive internal review of its asbestos and environmental reserves, as well as a regular biennial reserve review by an internationally-known actuarial consulting firm required by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department as part of the acquisition of CIGNA's property and casualty operations in 1999. ACE will conduct a conference call to discuss this charge on Monday, January 27, 2003, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Presentation materials will be available on the ACE Limited web site. ACE Limited will host a live webcast of this conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The public may access the webcast, available on a listen only basis, at www.acelimited.com. Please refer to our website, one half-hour before the call, for further log-in details. A replay of the webcast will be available from Monday, January 27, 2003, until Monday, February 10, 2003, 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. ACE said that the gross reserve increase of $2.178 billion is offset by $1.860 billion of reinsurance, including $533 million from the reinsurance agreement from National Indemnity Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. After an addition to our bad debt provision of $145 million, ten percent participation in the National Indemnity reinsurance cover, and a tax benefit of $162 million, ACE will record a net after-tax charge of $354 million in the fourth quarter ($1.32 per share). "ACE's total asbestos reserves are now at the high end of the range calculated by our internal analysis and are consistent with the actuarial consulting firm's best estimate," said Brian Duperreault, ACE Limited Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While we believe that there are favorable trends in the judicial environment regarding our asbestos liabilities, the reserve strengthening reflects a more conservative view and assumes that there will be no such future improvements." ACE also provided updated guidance for the fourth quarter 2002, excluding the above charge: -- Estimated operating income of $0.92 per share -- Estimated net income of $0.67 per share -- Unrealized gains in the fourth quarter of approximately $150 million (after-tax) -- Estimated shareholder equity as of 12/31/02 -- $6.7 billion -- Estimated operating cash flow in the fourth quarter in excess of $800 million
ACE will report the full details of its fourth quarter results on February 5, 2003 followed by a webcast conference call on February 6th at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
