Net Reinsurance Recoverable by Division
 
 
As illustrated in the table above, it is important to consider the composition of the recoverable balance and the related exposures in three components: Brandywine, Westchester and Active Operations recoverable. Active operations include the run-off operations of CIS. Additional information on reinsurance recoverable on a consolidated basis and for active operations for March 31, 2003 can be found on pages 29 and 30, respectively.
 
The Company's obligations with respect to further funding of the Brandywine runoff are limited pursuant to the Brandywine Restructuring Order under an $800 million aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement. (Refer to the "Asbestos and Environmental Claims" section of the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations" incorporated into our recently filed Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 for additional information about the order and other Company obligations.) At June 30, 2003 approximately $446 million in losses and recoverable bad debt reserves were ceded to the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement leaving a remaining limit of approximately $354 million.
 
As part of the Westchester acquisition, National Indemnity provided reinsurance protection for all losses occurring prior to 1997. At June 30, 2003, the remaining limit in the reinsurance cover was approximately $600 million.
 
The remaining balance of reinsurance recoverable consists of recoverables primarily associated with active operations.

At March 31, 2003, $10.3 billion of consolidated recoverables were from rated reinsurers, of which 95% were rated A- or better by Standard & Poor's.

Reinsurance Recoverable for Active Operations
 
 
At March 31, 2003, $5.7 billion of the active operations' recoverables were from rated reinsurers, of which 95% were rated A- or better by Standard & Poor's. At March 31, 2003, the $8.9 billion gross balance includes government pools of $753 million and structured settlements with recourse of $274 million, both of which present very limited collectibility exposure. The Company held collateral of $2.0 billion, of which $1.3 billion was matched and usable against existing recoverables.

Regulation GNon-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations; however,
they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as net income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments, the tax effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments and the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard, net of income tax. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
 
We exclude net realized gains (losses) on investments because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to the availability of market opportunities. The cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard is excluded from our calculation. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and including them would distort the analysis of trends. Income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) and the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
