On October 28, 2003, ACE Limited issued a press release reporting its third quarter 2003 results and the availability of its third quarter financial supplement. The press release and the financial supplement are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 
In accordance with general instruction B.6 of Form 8-K, the information in this report, including exhibits, is furnished pursuant to Item 12 and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liability of that section.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
DATE: October 28, 2003
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
ACE Limited (NYSE:ACE) today reported that fully diluted net income per share totaled $1.22, which included after-tax net realized gains of $51 million for the quarter. This compared with a net loss of $0.24 per share for the quarter a year ago after considering $205 million in net realized losses. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) for the third quarter of 2003 was up 105% to a record $304 million, or $1.04 per share, compared with $148 million or $0.53 per share for the same quarter last year.

Net premiums written increased 4% to $2.3 billion for the quarter. Out of total net premiums written, consolidated property and casualty increased by 27%, while Financial Services declined 78% reflecting the erratic nature of production in this segment. Most of this decline was due to the absence of new loss portfolio transfer and equity CDO premium for the quarter.
 
Brian Duperreault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited commented, "This was another excellent quarter for our Company that once again demonstrated the growing strength of our organization, our global presence and diversified product capability. ACE recorded increased income before net realized gains (losses) in every operating segment for the quarter. We remain optimistic about business conditions for the balance of the year and beyond."
 
Other operating highlights were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shareholders' equity is $8.3 billion, an increase of 31% from December 31, 2002. Tangible equity amounted to $5.6 billion, a gain of 53% in the first nine months. Total capital resources were $10.7 billion as of September 30, 2003. ACE's debt to total capital ratio improved to 17.7%. Income before net realized gains as a percent of average equity, including the application of FAS 115, on an annualized basis totaled 15.2% for the quarter, and 16.8 % excluding FAS 115.
 
Financial results improved over the prior year's results for each segment; details are available in the financial supplement. Key items include:

Regulation GNon-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations; however, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of book value per share to diluted book value per ordinary share is provided on page 33. The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as net income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and the tax effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
 
We exclude net realized gains (losses) on investments because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to the availability of market opportunities. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and including them would distort the analysis of trends. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
