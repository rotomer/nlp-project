Income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and the tax effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments is a common performance measurement. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) on investments because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. This measure should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

At December 31, 2003, $6.9 billion of the active operations' recoverables were from rated reinsurers, of which 85% were rated the equivalent of A- or better by nationally recognized rating agencies. The Company held collateral of $1.7 billion, of which $1.2 billion was matched and usable against existing recoverables.

Other includes amounts recoverable that are in dispute, or are from companies who are in supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Our estimation of this reserve considers the credit quality of the reinsurer, and whether we have received collateral or other credit protections such as parental guarantees.

Excludes recoverable amounts from companies who are in supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation, or are captive reinsurers, mandatory pools or voluntary pools.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations; however, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of book value per share to diluted book value per ordinary share is provided on page 33. The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and the tax effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
 
We exclude net realized gains (losses) on investments because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to the availability of market opportunities. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and including them would distort the analysis of trends. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
