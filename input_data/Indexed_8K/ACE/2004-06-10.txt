Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
ACE INA Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell up to $925,000,000 aggregate initial public offering price, or its equivalent based on the applicable exchange rate at the time of offering in such foreign or composite currencies as the Company shall designate at the time of offering, of its senior or subordinated debt securities (the "Debt Securities"), from time to time, in or pursuant to one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale. The Debt Securities will be unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest by ACE Limited, a Cayman Islands company (the "Guarantor").
 
The Debt Securities will be issued in one or more series as senior indebtedness (the "Senior Debt Securities") under an indenture, dated as of August 1, 1999 (the "Senior Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor to The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), or as subordinated indebtedness (the "Subordinated Debt Securities") under an indenture (the "Subordinated Indenture", and collectively with the Senior Indenture, the "Indentures", and each, an "Indenture"), dated as of December 1, 1999 among the Company, the Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee", and collectively with the Senior Trustee, the "Trustees", and each, a "Trustee"). Each series of Debt Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, rank, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements, conversion or exchange provisions and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the applicable Indenture.
 
Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Debt Securities, the Company and the Guarantor will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Debt Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the underwriters specified in the Terms Agreement (the "Underwriters", which term shall include any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Debt Securities shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities to be
 
issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter acting as co-manager in connection with such offering, the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities that each such Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed price basis, the initial offering price, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the form, time, date and place of delivery and payment of the Underwritten Securities and any other material variable terms of the Underwritten Securities. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Company and one or more of the Underwriters, acting for themselves and, if applicable, as representative(s) of any other Underwriters. Each offering of Underwritten Securities will be governed by this Underwriting Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement. As used herein, the term "Representative(s)" means, with respect to any offering of Debt Securities, any Underwriter(s) specified as the representative(s) of the Underwriters of such offering in the applicable Terms Agreement and if none is so designated, it means the Underwriters.
 
The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a joint registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-88482) and pre-effective amendments nos. 1 and 2 thereto, for the registration of the Debt Securities and the guarantee thereof of the Guarantor (the "Guarantee") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement was declared effective by the Commission on February 4, 2003 and each Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the Company and the Guarantor have filed such post-effective amendments to such registration statement as may be required prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement and each such post-effective amendment has been declared effective by the Commission. Such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable), including the information, if any, deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 430A Information") or Rule 434(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 434 Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and the final prospectus and the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company and the Guarantor for use in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that all references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement; provided, further, that if the Company and the Guarantor file a registration statement with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations (the "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement"), then, after such filing, all references to "Registration Statement" shall also be deemed to include the Rule 462 Registration Statement; and provided, further, that if the Company and the Guarantor elect to rely upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act Regulations, then all references to "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include the final or preliminary prospectus and the applicable term sheet or abbreviated term sheet (the "Term Sheet"), as the case may be, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company and the Guarantor in reliance upon Rule 434 of the 1933 Act
 
Regulations, and all references in this Underwriting Agreement to the date of the Prospectus shall mean the date of the Term Sheet. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus used before the Registration Statement became effective and any prospectus that omitted, as applicable, the Rule 430A Information, the Rule 434 Information or other information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations and was used after such effectiveness and prior to the execution and delivery of the applicable Terms Agreement. For purposes of this Underwriting Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Prospectus, Term Sheet or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
 
All references in this Underwriting Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement; and all references in this Underwriting Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the 1934 Act which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, after the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement.

compliance by the Company and the Guarantor, as applicable, with their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event (as defined below) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any assets, properties or operations of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) pursuant to, any Agreements and Instruments (except for such conflicts, breaches, defaults or Repayment Events or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change), nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the charter, by-laws, partnership agreement or other constitutive document of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) or, to the best of the Company's and the Guarantor's knowledge, any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) or over any of the assets, properties or operations of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company), except for such violations under applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. As used herein, a "Repayment Event" means any event or condition that gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or any person acting on such holder's behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company).
 
(19) . There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or to the knowledge of the Company or the Guarantor threatened or contemplated, against or affecting the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) that is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (other than as stated therein), or that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change, or that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company or the Guarantor to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement.

All of the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, except where the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. Neither the Guarantor nor any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses that, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

Insurance Laws
 
Each of the Guarantor and its insurance subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable insurance statutes and regulations and has filed all reports, documents or other information required to be filed under such statutes and regulations, except where the
 
failure to comply or file would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change; and each of the Guarantor and its insurance subsidiaries is in compliance with the insurance laws and regulations of other jurisdictions which are applicable to the Guarantor and its insurance subsidiaries (as the case may be), except where the failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor any Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.
 
(f) The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Underwritten Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representative(s) may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of the applicable Terms Agreement; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantor shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which they are not so qualified or to subject themselves to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which they are not otherwise so subject.

Indemnification of Underwriters.
 
(1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the
 
Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantor; and
 
(3) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representative(s)), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above;
 
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
 
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor, their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information and the Rule 434 Information deemed to be a part thereof, if applicable, or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
Indemnification of Company, Guarantor, Directors and Officers.
 
(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative(s), and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Guarantor. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification.
 
(d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(2) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse.
 
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
 
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, or, if Rule 434 is used, the corresponding location on the Term Sheet bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company and the Guarantor, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Initial Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
 
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities.

Agreement" are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety herein and shall be deemed to be a part of this Terms Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein. Terms defined in such document are used herein as therein defined.

Please accept this offer no later than o'clock P.M. (New York City time) on by signing a copy of this Terms Agreement in the space set forth below and returning the signed copy to us.
        
                    
 
 
 
Exhibit B
 
 
(i) The Guarantor has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as an exempted company, under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and has the corporate power and corporate authority to own, lease and operate its property, and to conduct its business, as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and to enter into and perform its obligations under, or as contemplated under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement.
 
(ii) The authorized share capital of the Guarantor, as set out in its Memorandum and Articles of Association, conforms as to legal matters to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. All of the Guarantor's Ordinary Shares have been duly and validly authorized and issued by the Guarantor and are registered in the books of the Guarantor as fully paid. On the basis that the contractual subscription price of all such Ordinary Shares is fully paid in cash (or equivalent consideration approved by the Directors), such Ordinary Shares issued may properly be credited as fully paid under Cayman Islands law and, as the Guarantor has been established on the basis that the liability of its shareholders is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on their Ordinary Shares (see Clause 5 of the Memorandum and Articles of Association), there is no rule of Cayman Islands law that would impose any further liability on persons holding Ordinary Shares in the Guarantor, merely by reason of such shareholding. So far as Cayman Islands law is concerned, the registered holders have good and valid title to their respective Ordinary Shares on the assumption that they have not entered into any liens, encumbrances, equities or claims which could give rise to any equitable interest on the part of any third party in respect of such Ordinary Shares. The holders of Ordinary Shares are not subject to any pre-emptive rights under the laws of the Cayman Islands or the Guarantor's Memorandum and Articles of Association.
 
(iii) The Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor.
 
(iv) The Guarantee has been duly authorized and delivered by the Guarantor for issuance and sale pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement.
 
(v) Each applicable Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor.
 
(vi) The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of, and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and each applicable Indenture and any other agreement or instrument entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Guarantor in connection with
 
the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation by the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement do not and will not (A) violate any provision of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Guarantor; (B) contravene any provision of any law, public rule or regulation of the Cayman Islands applicable to the Guarantor; (C) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, contravene any existing published order or decree of the courts of the Cayman Islands by which the Guarantor is bound or by which its properties or assets may be affected; or (D) require any consent, approval or authorization or order of, or qualification with, any Cayman Islands governmental agency in connection with the offer and sale of the Underwritten Securities and the Guarantee.
 
(vii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, but based only upon a search of the cause list at the offices of the Grand Courts of the Cayman Islands, there was no action, suit or proceeding to which the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is subject, before the courts of the Cayman Islands at the close of business on [specify a recent date].
 
(viii) All statements made in the Prospectus with regard to statutes, regulations, rules, treaties and other laws of the Cayman Islands (including, but not limited to, insurance, regulatory and tax matters and the Companies Law (2002 Revision) of the Cayman Islands) and enforcement of judgments in the Cayman Islands are accurate.
 
(ix) Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and to the extent that the laws of the Cayman Islands are relevant, the Guarantor has legally, validly, effectively and irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal and New York State courts sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York, State of New York, and has legally, validly and effectively appointed ACE USA, Inc. as the authorized agent of the Guarantor for the purposes described in Section 13 of the Underwriting Agreement assuming this to be the case as a matter of the applicable United States Federal and New York State laws.
 
(x) The choice of the laws of the State of New York, United States of America as the governing law of the Underwriting Agreement is a valid and effective choice of law and in an action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Cayman Islands, the laws of the State of New York would, to the extent specifically pleaded and proved as a fact by expert evidence, be recognized and applied by such court to all issues concerning the formal and essential validity of each of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the interpretation thereof, except that in any such action such court will apply those laws of the Cayman Islands as such court characterizes as procedural, and will not apply those laws of the State of New York as such court characterizes as procedural.
 
(xi) Although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of a judgment obtained in New York, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, based on the principle
 
that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided such judgment is final, for a liquidated sum, not in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, and was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands. A Cayman Islands court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. For the purposes of enforcement of a judgment granted against the Guarantor in respect of the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, a court in the Cayman Islands would recognize the jurisdiction of the applicable federal or state court to the jurisdiction of which the Guarantor has submitted rendering such judgment if service of process on the Guarantor is effected pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
(xii) On the basis that the Guarantor carries on its business as set forth in the Prospectus, there is no requirement that it be licensed under the Insurance Law, 1979, as amended, of the Cayman Islands.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of the Cayman Islands, to the extent such counsel deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel whom such counsel believes to be reliable (which opinion shall be dated and furnished to the Representative(s) at the Closing Time, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Underwriters and shall expressly state that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them), provided that such counsel shall state in their opinion that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying upon such opinion, and (B) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Guarantor, its subsidiaries and public officials.
 
Exhibit C
 
 
(i) Each of ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., Corporate Officers and Directors Assurance Ltd. and ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd. (collectively, the "Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries") (A) is validly existing under the laws of Bermuda as a company with limited liability and is in good standing under the laws of Bermuda (meaning that such company has not failed to make any filing with any Bermuda government authority or to pay any Bermuda government fee or tax, the failure of which would make such company immediately liable to be struck off the Register of Companies and thereby cease to exist under the laws of Bermuda) and (B) the corporate objects and powers contained in the Memorandum of Association of each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries are sufficient to allow them to carry on their business and to own, lease and operate its properties as both are described in the Prospectus.
 
(ii) Based solely upon a certified copy of the Register of Members for each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries, and without further inquiry, (a) all of the issued shares in the share capital of each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable (meaning that, subject to the common law doctrine of "piercing the corporate veil" and to any agreement to the contrary between the registered holders and such Bermuda Insurance Subsidiary, no further sums are required to be paid by the holders thereof in connection with the issue of such shares); and (b) the Guarantor is the registered holder of all the issued shares of each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries (except for a de minimis number of shares necessary to comply with applicable law); and (c) based solely upon the Register of Charges, and without further inquiry, there are no registered liens, encumbrances, equities or claims in the Register of Charges in respect of those shares.
 
(iii) Each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries is duly registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act of 1978 (Bermuda) and the regulations promulgated thereunder (together, the "Insurance Act") and as so registered, each Bermuda Insurance Subsidiary may conduct that insurance business which it is described in the Prospectus as carrying on; and, based solely on the Certificates of Compliance and without independent inquiry, each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries has filed with the appropriate Bermuda governmental authority all reports, documents or other information required to be filed under the Insurance Act.
 
(iv) The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of, and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and each applicable Indenture and any other agreement or instrument entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Guarantor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation by the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement do not and will not (A) violate any provision of
 
the Memorandum of Association or By-laws of each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries; (B) contravene any provision of any of those laws, rules and regulations of Bermuda which, in such counsel's opinion, based upon such counsel's experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement, except that such counsel need not express any opinion in this paragraph with respect to Bermuda securities laws; (C) based solely upon the Cause Book and without further inquiry, contravene any judgment, order or decree by the Bermuda Supreme Court against the Guarantor or any of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries; (D) based solely upon the Register of Charges and without further inquiry, conflict with, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or give rise to any right to accelerate the maturity or require the prepayment of any registered charge recorded in the Register of Charges against the Guarantor or any of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries; or (E) require any consent, approval or authorization or order of, or qualification with any Bermuda governmental agency, except such as have been obtained under the applicable securities laws of Bermuda in connection with the offer and sale of the Underwritten Securities.
 
(v) Based solely upon the Cause Book and without further inquiry, there is no action, suit or proceeding now pending before the Bermuda Supreme Court to which the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is subject.
 
(vi) All statements (but excluding those statements forming a part of financial information or accounts) made in the Registration Statement and Prospectus with respect to statutes, regulations, rules, treaties and other laws of Bermuda (including, but not limited to, statements made with respect to the Insurance Act and Bermuda tax matters) fairly and accurately present the information set forth therein and such counsel's opinion as to such matters.
 
(vii) The choice of the law of the State of New York as the governing law of the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Indenture is a valid choice of law and would be recognized and given effect to in any action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in Bermuda, except for those laws (A) that such court considers to be procedural in nature, (B) that are revenue or penal laws or (C) the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is interpreted under the laws of Bermuda.
 
(viii) The courts of Bermuda would recognize as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America against the Guarantor based upon the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Indenture under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) and would give a judgment based thereon provided that (A) such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment, (B) such courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of Bermuda, (C) such judgment was not obtained by fraud, (D) the enforcement of the
 
judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of Bermuda, (E) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of Bermuda and (F) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of Bermuda.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of Bermuda, to the extent such counsel deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel whom such counsel believes to be reliable (which opinion shall be dated and furnished to the Representative(s) at the Closing Time, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Underwriters and shall expressly state that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them), provided that such counsel shall state in their opinion that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying upon such opinion, and (B) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Guarantor, its subsidiaries and public officials.
 
Exhibit D
 
 
(i) The Guarantor is qualified to do business, and is in good standing, as a foreign corporation, under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not singly or in the aggregate result in a Material Adverse Change.
 
(ii) Each of ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., ACE USA, Inc. and the Company is qualified to transact business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property or in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) would not singly or in the aggregate result in a Material Adverse Change;
 
(iii) Except as set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, such counsel does not know of any outstanding (A) securities or obligations of the Guarantor convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries; (B) rights, warrants or options to acquire or purchase from the Guarantor any shares of capital stock of the Guarantor or any such convertible or exchangeable securities or obligations; or (C) obligations or understandings of the Guarantor to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, any such convertible or exchangeable securities or obligations, or any such warrants, rights or obligations.
 
(iv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, and other than as disclosed in the Prospectus, there are no threatened legal proceedings against the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries that, if determined adversely to the Guarantor or such subsidiary, would result in a Material Adverse Change.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company, the Guarantor, their respective subsidiaries and public officials.
 
Exhibit E
 
 
(i) Each of the Company and ACE USA, Inc. is duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
(ii) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and the [each] applicable [Indenture] and any other agreement or instrument entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement do not and will not (A) contravene any provision of any United States federal or New York State law, rule or regulation, in each case which, in such counsel's opinion, based on such counsel's experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement ("United States Applicable Laws"), except that such counsel need not express any opinion in this paragraph with respect to state securities laws; (B) contravene any judgment, order or decree known to such counsel without independent inquiry of any United States federal or New York State court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or by which their properties or assets may be affected; (C) conflict with, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or give rise to any right to accelerate the maturity or require the prepayment of any indebtedness or the purchase of any capital stock under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or instrument filed as an exhibit to the Guarantor's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or any agreement or instrument otherwise known to such counsel to which the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) is a party or by which it or any of them may be bound, or to which any of the assets, properties or operations of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) is subject, or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or ACE USA, except for such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, accelerations, repayments, repurchases, liens, charges or encumbrances that would not singly or in the aggregate result in a Material Adverse Change; or (D) based upon such counsel's review of the United States Applicable Laws, require any consent, approval or authorization or order of, or qualification with, any United States federal or state governmental agency or authority or court, except such as have been obtained under the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1939 Act and the 1939 Act Regulations and such as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws or state insurance laws in connection with the offer and sale of the Underwritten Securities.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware or the federal laws of the United States of America, to the extent such counsel deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel whom such counsel believes to be reliable (which opinion shall be dated and furnished to the Representative(s) at the Closing Time, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Underwriters and shall expressly state that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion as if it
 
were addressed to them), provided that such counsel shall state in their opinion that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying upon such opinion, and (B) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company, its subsidiaries and public officials.

ACE INA Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture referred to below), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of Five Hundred Million Dollars ($500,000,000) on June 15, 2014 and to pay interest thereon from June 9, 2004 or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 in each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing December 15, 2004, at the rate of 5.875% per annum, until the principal hereof (and any Additional Amounts (as defined below)) is paid or duly made available for payment. Interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. If any Interest Payment Date or the maturity date falls on a day that is
 
not a Business Day, the required payment shall be made on the next Business Day as if it were made on the date such payment was due and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the maturity date, as the case may be, to such next Business Day. The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be June 1 or December 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder hereof on the relevant regular record date by virtue of having been such Holder, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a subsequent special record date (which shall be at least 10 days before the payment date) for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Company, notice whereof shall be given to the Holders of Notes of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. Any interest paid on this Note shall be increased to the extent necessary to pay Additional Amounts as set forth in this Note.
 
Payment of the principal of, interest on or any Additional Amounts in respect of this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company and the Guarantor (as defined below) maintained for that purpose in The Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that, at the option of the Company or the Guarantor, interest may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register; provided, further, that payment to DTC or any successor Depository may be made by wire transfer to the account designated by DTC or such successor depository in writing.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest by ACE Limited, a Cayman Islands company (the "Guarantor"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of August 1, 1999 (herein called, together with all indentures supplemental thereto, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited (subject to exceptions provided in the Indenture) to the aggregate principal amount specified in the Officer's Certificate, dated June 9, 2004, establishing the terms of the Notes pursuant to the Indenture.
 
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Company's obligation to pay the principal of, interest on or any Additional Amounts in respect of the Notes is unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantor pursuant to Article 16 of the Indenture.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions permitting, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company or the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series issued under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company or the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Notes issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
This Note is not subject to any sinking fund.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, interest on or any Additional Amounts in respect of this Note, at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and in this Note, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company and the Guarantor maintained for that purpose in any place where the principal of, interest on or any Additional Amounts in respect of this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in the denominations specified in the Officer's Certificate, dated June 9, 2004, establishing the terms of the Notes, all as more fully provided in the Indenture and such Officer's Certificate. As provided in the Indenture and in such Officer's Certificate, and subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, such Officer's Certificate and in this Note, the Notes are exchangeable for a like
 
aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series in different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holders surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith, other than in certain cases provided in the Indenture.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Notes are redeemable as a whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100 percent of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (excluding interest accrued to the Redemption Date) and discounted to Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield-to-maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
"Business Day" means any calendar day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in New York, New York, and on which commercial banks are open for business in New York, New York.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the notes to be redeemed.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means either Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors, or, if both firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., or their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City, which we refer to as a "Primary Treasury Dealer", the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any three other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
 
All payments on this Note will be made without withholding of any present or future taxes or governmental charges of the Cayman Islands or Bermuda (each, a "Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the Company is required to do so by applicable law or regulation.
 
If the Company is required to withhold amounts, it will, subject to the limitations described below, pay to the Holder of this Note additional amounts so that every net payment made to the Holder of this Note, after the withholding, will be the same amount provided for in this Note and the Indenture ("Additional Amounts").
 
The Company will not be required to pay any Additional Amounts for (1) any tax or governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the fact that the Holder of this Note: (a) was a resident of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment or was physically present in, the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or otherwise had some connection with the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction other than the mere ownership of, or receipt of payment on, this Note, (b) presented this Note for payment in the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless this Note could not have been presented for payment elsewhere, or (c) presented this Note for payment more than 30 days after the date on which the payment became due unless the Holder of this Note would have been entitled to these Additional Amounts if the Holder of this Note had presented this Note for payment within the 30-day period; (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax or other governmental charge; (3) any tax or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because of failure by the Holder of this Note to comply with any reasonable request by the Company: (a) to provide information concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder of this Note or that of the beneficial owner of this Note; or (b) to make any claim or satisfy any information or reporting requirement, which in
 
either case is required by the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of the tax or other governmental charge; or (4) any combination of items (1), (2) or (3) above.
