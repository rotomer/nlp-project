Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statement or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
 
Based on the results of its independent investigation with respect to non-traditional or "finite risk" reinsurance agreement, ACE Limited ("ACE") has decided to amend and restate its financial results for the years 2000 through 2004, as well as its results for each of the quarters in the years 2003 and 2004, and for the first quarter of 2005. The primary purpose of the restatement is to correct the accounting treatment for eight transactions in the "non-traditional products" or "finite risk" category. ACE's decision to make this restatement was based on the results of the Company's independent investigation and an internal re-evaluation of the accounting for certain transactions. ACE has also included in the restatement correction of certain unrelated errors of an immaterial nature.
 
The estimated cumulative impact of the restatement through the first quarter of 2005 is an increase in shareholders' equity of approximately $1.0 million. The cumulative effect of the restatement for certain finite contracts as of the first quarter of 2005 is to increase shareholders' equity by $13 million. The cumulative effect of the other unrelated corrections is to decrease shareholders' equity by approximately $12 million. Additional detail pertaining to restated items year-by-year is provided in the table below. These estimates represent ACE's best current estimates of the effects of the restatement.

The following is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures:
 
 
 
 
ACE will file a Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004 during August 2005 reflecting these adjustments and their impact on disclosures as applicable for the years 2000-2004. The notes to the audited financial statements in the Form 10-K/A will reflect restatements for each of the quarters in the two years ended December 31, 2004. The Form 10-K/A will also include an updated management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2004. ACE will also file a Form 10-Q/A for the three months ended March 31, 2005 reflecting these adjustments.
 
As a result of the foregoing restatement, ACE's original financial statements and related independent registered public accountants' reports thereon for those periods should no longer be relied upon.
 
Background
 
As previously reported, ACE and its subsidiaries have received numerous subpoenas, interrogatories and civil investigative demands in connection with the ongoing industry wide investigations of insurance business practices and non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance products, often referred to as "finite risk reinsurance." An independent investigation into these products, under the direction of the Audit Committee of ACE's Board of Directors, reviewed finite risk contracts to which ACE subsidiaries were a party. ACE itself also re-evaluated the accounting of certain transactions. The investigation has not identified any instances of inappropriate conduct by current senior management of the company or by members of the Board of Directors. The investigation is continuing and is expected to be concluded by the time of the restatement.
 
As a result of this investigation and the re-evaluation, ACE believes that eight finite risk contracts were accounted for in an incorrect manner. Of these, seven did not meet the applicable risk transfer requirements of FAS 113, and should have been recorded as deposits. The remaining contract was an inter-company agreement which was not properly eliminated in consolidation. Each of these eight contracts originated prior to 2002. Two of them remain in effect; six are no longer in effect. Of the eight contracts, three involved ACE as buyer, three involved ACE as seller and two were between wholly-owned subsidiaries of ACE Limited.
"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts,"
 
Some of the contracts being restated involved written or oral agreements, understandings or discussions pertaining to risk expectations that were not factored into the accounting treatment at the time of origination. In certain instances, agreements of this sort reduced or eliminated the anticipated risk transfer upon which the original accounting was based and resulted in the present restatement.
 
Based on these determinations, ACE's management recommended to the Audit Committee of ACE's Board of Directors that adjustments be made to correct the accounting treatment of these reinsurance arrangements. After conferring with ACE's management and discussing the matter with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, on July 18, 2005, ACE's Audit Committee heard and adopted that recommendation and the Board of Directors accepted the recommendation and authorized the restatement.
 
ACE believes that it has established appropriate internal controls, both before and during the course of the investigation, to address these issues. These controls include the prohibition of so-called "buy-side" finite risk contract acquisition without approval of the chief executive officer of ACE Limited, and the issuance of extensive guidelines and restrictions pertaining to the accounting for and marketing of so-called "sell- side" finite risk contracts.
The adjustments reflected in the restatement will also include the correction of certain unrelated entries that should have been recorded in the periods being restated. These relate to errors identified in the accounting for certain deferred compensation plans and immaterial adjustments made in prior quarters.
 
It is possible that at the time of the restatement ACE will include other items or additional finite risk contracts. In addition, further restatements of ACE's financial results are also possible.

The primary purpose of the restatement is to correct the accounting treatment for eight transactions in the "non-traditional products" or "finite risk" category.

These relate to errors identified in the accounting for certain deferred compensation plans and immaterial adjustments made in prior quarters.
 
Evan Greenberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, said, "The Company engaged independent counsel to review our finite book of business in response to the industry wide review of finite risk reinsurance by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the United States Attorney, the New York Attorney General and various state regulators. The investigation, which included both independent counsel and accounting experts, reviewed over 100 finite risk transactions and raised questions about the accounting for a number of transactions. In addition, our own accounting and actuarial staff took a fresh look at many transactions. The restatement we are announcing is the result of a process that has been both impartial and rigorous. It reflects management's best judgment about proper accounting based on the information we have gathered.
 
"We have found accounting problems on a number of transactions and we regret that. We are fixing those problems. We have also put in place strict procedures to assure that this does not happen again.
 
"We have shared the results of our independent investigation with the authorities as those results have emerged. The governmental investigations will continue, however, and we will continue to respond to all appropriate regulatory inquiries. ACE's own investigation is continuing as well and we expect it to be concluded by the time of the restatement."
 
It is possible that at the time of the restatement ACE will include other items or additional finite risk contracts. In addition, further restatements of ACE's financial results are also possible.
