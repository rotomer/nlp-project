Item 8.01. Other Events.
 
ACE Limited has resolved a lawsuit brought by the Connecticut Attorney General, and will pay $40,000 in exchange for a release of Connecticut's claims and a withdrawal of the lawsuit.
 
The claims related to certain underwriting practices associated with an $80 million portfolio of Connecticut workers compensation claims which the company is administering.
 
On March 21, 2005, the company filed a motion to dismiss the case, stating it believed the case was without merit. The decision to settle avoids the cost of further litigation.
 
ACE will continue to administer its contract with the state and continue with its business of handling workers compensation claims for Connecticut.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
