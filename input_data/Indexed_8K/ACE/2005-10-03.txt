Item 7.01  
Regulation FD Disclosure
 
ACE Limited is furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide additional information with respect to its estimates for losses relating to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the New Orleans flood and to provide updated guidance for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 and the year ending December 31, 2005..
 
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the New Orleans Flood
 
The following table provides additional information with respect to ACE's estimates for losses relating to Hurricane Katrina and the New Orleans flood.
 
 
ACE's reinsurance recoverables with respect to Hurricane Rita and the New Orleans flood are high quality and well diversified with nearly 50% of exposure collateralized and 89% of the uncollateralized reinsurers having ratings of "A" or better.  The top 5 reinsurers account for 29% of the total reinsurance recoverables and the duration of the recoverables is less than two years with no long term contracts.
 
On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita, a Category 3 hurricane, struck the Gulf Coast of the United States. Hurricane Rita has produced numerous losses, though significantly less than the losses attributable to Hurricane Katrina and the New Orleans flood. ACE's preliminary estimates indicate that total net losses related to Hurricane Rita for the entire ACE Group of Companies will be approximately $100 million to $150 million after tax.
 
These estimates were based on ground-up reviews, which, with respect to Hurricane Rita, are still underway, of a substantial majority of ACE's in-force direct policies that ACE believes are affected and information, which, with respect to Hurricane Rita, are still being received and evaluated, from ACE's insureds and cedents and internal modeling with respect to ACE's in-force reinsurance policies that ACE believes are affected.  Actual
losses may vary materially from these estimates as a result of, among other things, the receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers, the attribution of losses to coverages that for the purpose of these estimates ACE assumed would not be exposed and inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials.
 
Updated Guidance
 
The following sets forth updated guidance with respect to the three-month period ended September 30, 2005 and the twelve months ending December 31, 2005:
 
 
 
(1) Operating loss per share excludes net realized gains (losses) and the tax effect of net realized gains (losses).  The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles would be the same as ACE does not estimate net realized gains (losses) or the tax effect of net realized gains (losses).  ACE believes this presentation enhances the understanding of its expected results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of its insurance business. ACE excludes net realized gains (losses) because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities.
ACE expects that at December 31, 2005, it will have total capital of approximately $14.4 billion, total equity of approximately of $12.0 billion, tangible equity of approximately of $9.3 billion and invested assets of approximately $32.8 billion.  Finally, ACE expects that, notwithstanding the significant losses from the third quarter storms, its return on equity for the year ending December 31, 2005 will be approximately 11% and operating earnings to be in excess of $1.1 billion.
