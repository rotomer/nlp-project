        Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 1.01 
On November 14, 2005, the Company amended and restated its outsourcing agreement with IBM Corporation relating to the management of the Company's information technology infrastructure.  The amendment extended the term of the outsourcing agreement for an additional three years so that the agreement will be in effect until 2012 and reduced the projected payments from ACE per year by an estimated $11 million dollars.  Additionally, the amendment reduced the termination charges that ACE would incur by terminating the outsourcing agreement early.  The amendment is effective as of November 1, 2005.
In contrast to the existing outsourcing agreement, the amendment permits ACE to obtain from third parties services similar to those provided by IBM.  Further, the amendment includes new methodologies for measuring the levels of service provided by IBM and includes express goals for the levels of service that IBM is required to provide.  Finally,  the amendment permits IBM to provide some services from locations outside the United States.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
