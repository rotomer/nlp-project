Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations; however, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of book value per share is provided on page 33.
In presenting our segment operating results we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses).
The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) and the tax expense on net realized gains (losses). We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to the availability of market opportunities. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and including them would distort the analysis of trends. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
 
We also present income excluding net realized gains (losses), catastrophe losses and A&E, net of tax because those losses are deemed to be significant for the quarter and the year. Catastrophes are not predictable and cause significant variability in periodic earnings. On pages 13 and 14 we have presented net premium written, net premium earned, loss ratios, expense ratios and combined ratios excluding catastrophes and A&E as we believe this separate presentation is meaningful and useful for users of our financial information.
