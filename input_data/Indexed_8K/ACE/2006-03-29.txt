Within the section entitled "Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsUnpaid Losses and Loss Expenses" (appearing on page 68 of the Form 10-K as filed), the table segregating loss reserves by components incorrectly classified the first subtotal as "Casualty" when it should have been classified as "Property and other" and the second subtotal as "Property" when it should have been classified as "Casualty". The complete table, as corrected, appears below.
The following table segregates the reserves by components including property and other, casualty and personal accident at December 31, 2005.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
