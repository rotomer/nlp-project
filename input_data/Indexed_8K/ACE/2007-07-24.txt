FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 ACE Limited (NYSE: ACE) today reported net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007 of $1.93 per ordinary share after payment of preferred dividends, compared with net income of $1.72 per share for the same quarter last year.

 An $88 million pre-tax catastrophe charge including reinstatement premiums was incurred during the quarter related to the floods in the U.K., the U.S. and Australia. An unrealized after-tax loss of $382 million was incurred from the mark-to-market effect of rising interest rates. Book value increased $225 million in the quarter. Investment portfolio exposure to sub-prime mortgages is negligible; there has been no adverse impact nor is any foreseen.
 
 
 
Net income for the first six months of 2007 was $4.02 per share, compared with $3.18 per share for the first six months of 2006. For the first six months of 2007, income excluding net realized gains (losses) and cumulative effect was $3.95 per share, compared with $3.17 per share for the same period of 2006.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. We exclude the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of tax because this amount resulted in a one-time adjustment to income.
Operating Income or Income excluding net realized gains (losses) and cumulative effect, net of tax
is calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other (income) expense, interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
Underwriting income
is shareholders' equity less goodwill. See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 21 in the financial supplement.
Tangible shareholders' equity
These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
2
The cumulative effect is a benefit resulting from the inclusion of a forfeiture rate on restricted stock in our stock compensation expense calculations, as required under Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 123R.
3
Calculated using income excluding net realized gains (losses).
4
Book value per ordinary share is ordinary shareholders' equity divided by the shares outstanding. Tangible book value per ordinary share is ordinary shareholders' equity less goodwill divided by the shares outstanding.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of book value per share is provided on page 22.
 
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses).
 
The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income excluding net realized gains (losses), the tax expense (benefit) on net realized gains (losses), and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. We exclude the benefit of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of tax, because this benefit resulted in a one time adjustment to income. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and including them would distort the analysis of trends. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) and cumulative effect should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
