On November 8, 2007, (i) ACE Limited, ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd. and ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd. as Borrowers, entered into a syndicated letter of credit reimbursement agreement (the "replacement LC Agreement"), with the banks named therein, including Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners and (ii) ACE Limited, ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd. and ACE INA Holdings Inc. as Borrowers, entered into a $500,000,000 syndicated credit agreement (the "replacement Credit Agreement"), with the banks named therein, including J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Barclays Capital as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.
The replacement LC Agreement permits the issuance of up to $1,000,000,000 of letters of credit on an unsecured basis. The replacement LC Agreement supersedes (i) the $1,000,000,000 unsecured syndicated letter of credit reimbursement agreement and (ii) the secured $500,000,000 syndicated letter of credit reimbursement agreement, both dated July 1, 2005, among ACE Limited, ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd. and ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd. as Borrowers, the banks and other lenders named therein including Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Banc of America Securities LLC as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners.
The replacement Credit Agreement is unsecured and can be used for general corporate purposes and LOC issuance. The replacement Credit Agreement supersedes (i) the $600,000,000 credit agreement dated December 15, 2005 among ACE Limited, ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd. and ACE INA Holdings Inc. as Borrowers, the banks and other lenders named therein including J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Barclays Capital as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners and (ii) the $50,000,000 credit agreement dated as of March 31, 2006, which had been renewed through March 2008, among ACE Limited as Borrower and ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd. and ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd. as Guarantors and ING Bank N.V. as lender.
Under the replacement LC Agreement and replacement Credit Agreement (collectively "the Replacement Agreements"), the respective Borrowers pay a utilization fee of 0.24 percent per annum (depending on ratings and usage) plus a commitment fee of 0.06 percent per annum payable on any unutilized portion of the facility. In addition to the foregoing fees, the respective Borrowers pay customary arrangement and administration fees as well as customary administrative charges to the issuer of any letter of credit issued under the Replacement Agreements.
The terms, conditions and covenants of the Replacement Agreements are substantially similar to covenants in other ACE group credit facilities. The Replacement Agreements contain customary covenants, including covenants limiting liens, substantial asset sales and mergers. Most of these restrictions are subject to certain minimum thresholds and exceptions. The Replacement Agreements also contain financial covenants that require:
(i) maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth of not less than $9.570 billion (subject to an annual reset provision) plus 25 percent of cumulative net income from December 31, 2006, plus 50 percent of the net proceeds of any issuance of equity interests subsequent to December 31, 2006; and
(ii) maintenance of a ratio of total debt (excluding trust preferred securities and mezzanine capital to the extent not exceeding 15 percent of total capitalization) to total capitalization of not greater than 0.35 to 1.
In addition, the Replacement Agreements have customary events of default, including (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods) payment default, failure to comply with covenants, material inaccuracy of representation or warranty, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, change of control and cross-default to other debt agreements.

If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

If the forms provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such forms; that if, at the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of this Section 2.13 in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includible in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date.

claim and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Borrowers, make a claim to such governmental authority for such refund at the Borrowers' expense, if obtaining such refund would not, in the good faith judgment of the Lender or Administrative Agent entitled to such refund, be materially disadvantageous to such Lender or the Administrative Agent; that nothing in this Section 2.13(h) shall be construed to require any Lender or the Administrative Agent to institute any administrative proceeding (other than the filing of a claim for any such refund) or judicial proceeding to obtain any such refund. If a Lender or the Administrative Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers or with respect to which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.13, it shall within 60 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to the Borrowers (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section 2.13 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund); provided, however, that the Borrowers, upon request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, agree to repay the amount paid over to the Borrowers (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. Nothing in this Section 2.13(h) shall be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person.

Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing an interest or participating interest from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or participating interest, as the case may be, as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such interest or participating interest, as the case may be.

In the event that, on any date, any Borrower shall so set off and otherwise apply its obligation to make any such payment against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make any such Defaulted Advance on or prior to such date, the amount so set off and otherwise applied by such Borrower shall constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents an Advance by such Defaulting Lender made on the date of such setoff.
