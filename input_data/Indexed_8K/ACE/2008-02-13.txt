Ladies and Gentlemen:
ACE INA Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell up to $300,000,000 aggregate initial public offering price, or its equivalent based on the applicable exchange rate at the time of offering in such foreign or composite currencies as the Company shall designate at the time of offering, of its senior or subordinated debt securities (the "Debt Securities"), from time to time, in or pursuant to one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale. The Debt Securities will be unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest by ACE Limited, a Cayman Islands company (the "Guarantor").
The Debt Securities will be issued in one or more series as senior indebtedness (the "Senior Debt Securities") under an indenture, dated as of August 1, 1999 (the "Senior Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association (as successor to The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), or as subordinated indebtedness (the "Subordinated Debt Securities") under an indenture (the "Subordinated Indenture", and collectively with the Senior Indenture, the "Indentures", and each, an "Indenture"), dated as of December 1, 1999 among the Company, the Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee", and collectively with the Senior Trustee, the "Trustees", and each, a "Trustee"). Each series of Debt Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, rank, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements, conversion or exchange provisions and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the applicable Indenture.
Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Debt Securities, the Company and the Guarantor will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Debt Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the underwriters specified in the Terms Agreement (the "Underwriters", which term shall include any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the offering of Debt Securities shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities to be
 
issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter acting as co-manager in connection with such offering, the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities that each such Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed price basis, the initial offering price, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the form, time, date and place of delivery and payment of the Underwritten Securities and any other material variable terms of the Underwritten Securities. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Company and one or more of the Underwriters, acting for themselves and, if applicable, as representative(s) of any other Underwriters. Each offering of Underwritten Securities will be governed by this Underwriting Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement. As used herein, the term "Representative(s)" means, with respect to any offering of Debt Securities, any Underwriter(s) specified as the representative(s) of the Underwriters of such offering in the applicable Terms Agreement and if none is so designated, it means the Underwriters.
The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a joint automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-130378), for the registration of the Debt Securities and the guarantee thereof of the Guarantor (the "Guarantee") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement became effective automatically upon filing on December 16, 2005, each Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the Company and the Guarantor have filed such post-effective amendments to such registration statement as may be required prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement and each such post-effective amendment became effective automatically upon filing with the Commission. At any given time, such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable, to such time), including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at such time pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act (the "Rule 430B Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and the final base prospectus or prospectuses and the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company and the Guarantor for use in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that at any given time references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), as of, in the case of the Registration Statement, such given date, or, in the case of the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus used before the Registration Statement became effective and any prospectus that omitted information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations and was used after such effectiveness and prior to the relevant Applicable Time (as defined in the applicable Terms Agreement), including in each case any base prospectus so used and the documents incorporated by reference therein. For purposes of this Underwriting Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
 
The term "Disclosure Package" shall mean (i) each preliminary prospectus, as amended or supplemented, used in connection with the offer of the Underwritten Securities, (ii) the issuer free writing prospectuses as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), if any, (iii) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package and (iv) the Final Term Sheet (as defined herein), which shall be identified in Schedule I to the applicable Terms Agreement.
All references in this Underwriting Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is, at a given time, "contained," "included" or "stated" (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference or deemed to be included in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, as of, in the case of the Registration Statement, such given time, or, in the case of the Prospectus, the date of the Prospectus, or, in the case of a preliminary prospectus, the relevant Applicable Time; and all references in this Underwriting Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus shall be deemed, at a given time, to mean and include the filing of any document under 1934 Act or the 1933 Act which is incorporated by reference or deemed to be included in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary prospectus, as the case may be, after, in the case of the Registration Statement, such given time, or, in the case of the Prospectus, the date of the Prospectus, or, in the case of a preliminary prospectus, the relevant Applicable Time.
SECTION 1. .
Representations and Warranties
(a) The Company and the Guarantor represent and warrant to each Underwriter named in the applicable Terms Agreement, as of the date thereof, as of the Applicable Time and as of the Closing Time (as defined below) (in each case, a "Representation Date"), as follows:
Representations and Warranties by the Company and the Guarantor.
(1) . (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the 1933 Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act or form of prospectus) and (iii) at the execution time of each of this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement (with each such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iii)), the Company was and is a "well known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement", as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act, neither the Company nor the Guarantor has received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the 1933 Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf registration statement form and neither the Company nor the Guarantor has otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form.
Compliance with Registration Requirements; Disclosure
 
(i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement relating to the Underwritten Securities that the Company, the Guarantor or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the 1933 Act) and (ii) as of the date of the execution and delivery of each of this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement (with each such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (ii)), neither the Company nor the Guarantor was or is an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 of the 1933 Act that it is not necessary that either the Company or the Guarantor be considered an Ineligible Issuer.
No stop order has been issued under the 1933 Act and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Guarantor, are contemplated by the Commission, and any request on the part of the Commission for additional information has been complied with. In addition, each Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.
At the respective times the Registration Statement became effective or was deemed effective with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the 1933 Act and at each Representation Date, the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1939 Act (the "1939 Act Regulations") and did not and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
At the date of the Prospectus and at the Closing Time, neither the Prospectus nor any amendments and supplements thereto included or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
As of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Neither any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus nor the Final Term Sheet, as of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the completion of the offering of the Underwritten Securities or until any earlier date that the Company or the Guarantor notified or notifies the Representatives as described in the next sentence, did not, does not and will not include any information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus, including any document incorporated by reference therein that has not been superseded or modified. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such
 
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus, the Company has promptly notified or will promptly notify the Representatives and has promptly amended or supplemented or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict.
The Company has not distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Time and the completion of the Underwriters' distribution of the Underwritten Securities, any offering material in connection with the offering and sale of the Underwritten Securities other than a preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the Representatives and included in Schedule I to the applicable Terms Agreement or the Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties in this subsection shall not apply to statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor in writing by any Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.
To the Company's knowledge, the Registration Statement is not the subject of a pending proceeding or examination under Section 8(d) or 8(e) of the 1933 Act, nor is the Company or the Guarantor the subject of a pending proceeding under Section 8A of the 1933 Act in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities.
Each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus filed as part of the Registration Statement as originally filed or as part of any amendment thereto, or filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act, complied when so filed in all material respects with the 1933 Act Regulations and each preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of Underwritten Securities will, at the time of such delivery, be identical to any electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.
(2) . The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, at the time they were or hereafter are filed with the Commission, complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "1934 Act Regulations") and, when read together with the other information in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, at the Applicable Time or at the date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, and at the Closing Time, did not and will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Absence of Further Requirements
(22) . The Guarantor and its subsidiaries (including the Company) possess such permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively, "Governmental Licenses") issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business now operated by them, except where the failure to so possess any such Governmental Licenses would not, singly or in aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. The Guarantor and its subsidiaries (including the Company) are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. All of the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, except where the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. Neither the Guarantor nor any of its subsidiaries (including the Company) has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses that, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Underwritten Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or for the Company and the Guarantor, to amend the Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company and the Guarantor will promptly prepare and file with the Commission, at its own expense, subject to Section 3(b), such amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or omission or to comply with such requirements, the

(1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the Final Term Sheet, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantor; and
(3) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representative(s)), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above;
 
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor, their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
Indemnification of Company, Guarantor, Directors and Officers.
(c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative(s), and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Guarantor. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Actions against Parties; Notification.
 
(d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(2) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse.
SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company and the Guarantor, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Initial Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities.

Liabilities.
SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representative(s) shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative(s) shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:

(a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
 
(b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either the Representative(s) or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

Exhibit B
(i) The Guarantor has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as an exempted company, under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and has the corporate power and corporate authority to own, lease and operate its property, and to conduct its business, as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and to enter into and perform its obligations under, or as contemplated under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement.
(ii) The authorized share capital of the Guarantor, as set out in its Memorandum and Articles of Association, conforms as to legal matters to the description thereof contained in each of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. All of the Guarantor's Ordinary Shares have been duly and validly authorized and issued by the Guarantor and are registered in the books of the Guarantor as fully paid. On the basis that the contractual subscription price of all such Ordinary Shares is fully paid in cash (or equivalent consideration approved by the Directors), such Ordinary Shares issued may properly be credited as fully paid under Cayman Islands law and, as the Guarantor has been established on the basis that the liability of its shareholders is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on their Ordinary Shares (see Clause 5 of the Memorandum and Articles of Association), there is no rule of Cayman Islands law that would impose any further liability on persons holding Ordinary Shares in the Guarantor, merely by reason of such shareholding. So far as Cayman Islands law is concerned, the registered holders have good and valid title to their respective Ordinary Shares on the assumption that they have not entered into any liens, encumbrances, equities or claims which could give rise to any equitable interest on the part of any third party in respect of such Ordinary Shares. The holders of Ordinary Shares are not subject to any pre-emptive rights under the laws of the Cayman Islands or the Guarantor's Memorandum and Articles of Association.
(iii) The Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor.
(iv) The Guarantee has been duly authorized and delivered by the Guarantor for issuance and sale pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement.
(v) Each applicable Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor.
(vi) The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of, and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and each applicable Indenture and any other agreement or instrument
 
entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Guarantor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation by the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement do not and will not (A) violate any provision of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Guarantor; (B) contravene any provision of any law, public rule or regulation of the Cayman Islands applicable to the Guarantor; (C) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, contravene any existing published order or decree of the courts of the Cayman Islands by which the Guarantor is bound or by which its properties or assets may be affected; or (D) require any consent, approval or authorization or order of, or qualification with, any Cayman Islands governmental agency in connection with the offer and sale of the Underwritten Securities and the Guarantee.
(vii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, but based only upon a search of the cause list at the offices of the Grand Courts of the Cayman Islands, there was no action, suit or proceeding to which the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is subject, before the courts of the Cayman Islands at the close of business on [specify a recent date].
(viii) All statements made in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus with regard to statutes, regulations, rules, treaties and other laws of the Cayman Islands (including, but not limited to, insurance, regulatory and tax matters and the Companies Law (2002 Revision) of the Cayman Islands) and enforcement of judgments in the Cayman Islands are accurate.
(ix) Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and to the extent that the laws of the Cayman Islands are relevant, the Guarantor has legally, validly, effectively and irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal and New York State courts sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York, State of New York, and has legally, validly and effectively appointed ACE USA, Inc. as the authorized agent of the Guarantor for the purposes described in Section 13 of the Underwriting Agreement assuming this to be the case as a matter of the applicable United States Federal and New York State laws.
(x) The choice of the laws of the State of New York, United States of America as the governing law of the Underwriting Agreement is a valid and effective choice of law and in an action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Cayman Islands, the laws of the State of New York would, to the extent specifically pleaded and proved as a fact by expert evidence, be recognized and applied by such court to all issues concerning the formal and essential validity of each of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the interpretation thereof, except that in any such action such court will apply those laws of the Cayman Islands as such court characterizes as procedural, and will not apply those laws of the State of New York as such court characterizes as procedural.
(xi) Although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of a
 
judgment obtained in New York, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided such judgment is final, for a liquidated sum, not in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, and was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to the public policy of the Cayman Islands. A Cayman Islands court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. For the purposes of enforcement of a judgment granted against the Guarantor in respect of the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, a court in the Cayman Islands would recognize the jurisdiction of the applicable federal or state court to the jurisdiction of which the Guarantor has submitted rendering such judgment if service of process on the Guarantor is effected pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement.
(xii) On the basis that the Guarantor carries on its business as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there is no requirement that it be licensed under the Insurance Law, 1979, as amended, of the Cayman Islands.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of the Cayman Islands, to the extent such counsel deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel whom such counsel believes to be reliable (which opinion shall be dated and furnished to the Representative(s) at the Closing Time, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Underwriters and shall expressly state that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them), provided that such counsel shall state in their opinion that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying upon such opinion, and (B) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Guarantor, its subsidiaries and public officials.
 
Exhibit C
(i) Each of ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., Corporate Officers and Directors Assurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Reinsurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd. and ACE INA Overseas Insurance Company Ltd. (collectively, the "Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries") (A) is validly existing under the laws of Bermuda as a company with limited liability and is in good standing under the laws of Bermuda (meaning that such company has not failed to make any filing with any Bermuda government authority or to pay any Bermuda government fee or tax, the failure of which would make such company immediately liable to be struck off the Register of Companies and thereby cease to exist under the laws of Bermuda) and (B) the corporate objects and powers contained in the Memorandum of Association of each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries are sufficient to allow them to carry on their business and to own, lease and operate its properties as both are described in each of the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(ii) Based solely upon a certified copy of the Register of Members for each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries, and without further inquiry, (a) all of the issued shares in the share capital of each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable (meaning that no further sums are required to be paid by the holders thereof in connection with the issue of such shares); and (b) the Guarantor is the direct or indirect registered holder of all the issued shares of each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries; and (c) based solely upon the Register of Charges, and without further inquiry, there are no registered liens, encumbrances, equities or claims in the Register of Charges in respect of those shares.
(iii) Each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries is duly registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act of 1978 (Bermuda) and the regulations promulgated thereunder (together, the "Insurance Act") and as so registered, each Bermuda Insurance Subsidiary may conduct that insurance business which it is described in each of the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus as carrying on; and, based solely on the Certificates of Compliance and without independent inquiry, each of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries has filed with the appropriate Bermuda governmental authority all reports, documents or other information required to be filed under the Insurance Act.
(iv) The execution and delivery by the Guarantor of, and the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and each applicable Indenture and any other agreement or instrument entered into or issued or to be entered into or issued by the Guarantor in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and the consummation by the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement do not and will not (A) violate any provision of the Memorandum of Association or Bye-laws of each of the Bermuda Insurance
 
Subsidiaries; (B) contravene any provision of any of those laws, rules and regulations of Bermuda which, in such counsel's opinion, based upon such counsel's experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and such Terms Agreement, except that such counsel need not express any opinion in this paragraph with respect to Bermuda securities laws; (C) based solely upon the Cause Book and without further inquiry, contravene any judgment, order or decree by the Bermuda Supreme Court against the Guarantor or any of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries; (D) based solely upon the Register of Charges and without further inquiry, conflict with, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or give rise to any right to accelerate the maturity or require the prepayment of any registered charge recorded in the Register of Charges against the Guarantor or any of the Bermuda Insurance Subsidiaries; or (E) require any consent, approval or authorization or order of, or qualification with any Bermuda governmental agency, except such as have been obtained under the applicable securities laws of Bermuda in connection with the offer and sale of the Underwritten Securities.
(v) Based solely upon the Cause Book and without further inquiry, there is no action, suit or proceeding now pending before the Bermuda Supreme Court to which the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which the assets, properties or operations of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is subject, other than certain actions set out in the opinion.
(vi) All statements (but excluding those statements forming a part of financial information or accounts) made in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and Prospectus with respect to statutes, regulations, rules, treaties and other laws of Bermuda (including, but not limited to, statements made with respect to the Insurance Act and Bermuda tax matters) are accurate in all material respects.
(vii) The choice of the law of the State of New York as the governing law of the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Indenture is a valid choice of law and would be recognized and given effect to in any action brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in Bermuda, except for those laws (A) that such court considers to be procedural in nature, (B) that are revenue or penal laws or (C) the application of which would be inconsistent with public policy, as such term is interpreted under the laws of Bermuda.
(viii) The courts of Bermuda would recognize as a valid judgment, a final and conclusive judgment in personam obtained in the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America against the Guarantor based upon the Underwriting Agreement and the applicable Indenture under which a sum of money is payable (other than a sum of money payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty) and would give a judgment based thereon provided that (A) such courts had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment, (B) such courts did not contravene the rules of natural justice of Bermuda, (C) such judgment was not obtained by fraud, (D) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the public policy of Bermuda, (E) no new admissible
 
evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to the rendering of the judgment by the courts of Bermuda and (F) there is due compliance with the correct procedures under the laws of Bermuda.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than the laws of Bermuda, to the extent such counsel deems proper and specified in such opinion, upon the opinion of other counsel whom such counsel believes to be reliable (which opinion shall be dated and furnished to the Representative(s) at the Closing Time, shall be satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the Underwriters and shall expressly state that the Underwriters may rely on such opinion as if it were addressed to them), provided that such counsel shall state in their opinion that they believe that they and the Underwriters are justified in relying upon such opinion, and (B) as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Guarantor, its subsidiaries and public officials.
 
Exhibit D
(i) The Guarantor is qualified to do business, and is in good standing, as a foreign corporation, under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not singly or in the aggregate result in a Material Adverse Change.
(ii) Each "significant subsidiary" of the Company (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the 1933 Act) and the Company is qualified to transact business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real property or in which the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions which recognize such concept) would not singly or in the aggregate result in a Material Adverse Change;
(iii) Except as set forth in each of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, such counsel does not know of any outstanding (A) securities or obligations of the Guarantor convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries; (B) rights, warrants or options to acquire or purchase from the Guarantor any shares of capital stock of the Guarantor or any such convertible or exchangeable securities or obligations; or (C) obligations or understandings of the Guarantor to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, any such convertible or exchangeable securities or obligations, or any such warrants, rights or obligations.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact (but not as to legal conclusions), to the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company, the Guarantor, their respective subsidiaries and public officials.

"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield-to-maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Business Day" means any calendar day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in New York, New York, and on which commercial banks are open for business in New York, New York.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the notes to be redeemed.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means (1) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Independent Investment Banker" means Banc of America Securities LLC and its respective successors, or, if the firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Banc of America Securities LLC and its respective successors; provided, however, that if the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City, which we refer to as a "Primary Treasury Dealer," the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
All payments on this Note will be made without withholding of any present or future taxes or governmental charges of the jurisdiction of the Company's organization or principal executive offices (each, a "Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the Company is required to do so by applicable law or regulation.
If the Company is required to withhold amounts, it will, subject to the limitations described below, pay to the Holder of this Note additional amounts so that every net payment made to the Holder of this Note, after the withholding, will be the same amount provided for in this Note and the Indenture ("Additional Amounts").
The Company will not be required to pay any Additional Amounts for (1) any tax or governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the fact that the Holder of this Note: (a) was a resident of, or engaged in business or maintained a permanent establishment or was physically present in, the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or otherwise had some connection with the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction other than the mere ownership of, or receipt of payment on, this Note, (b) presented this Note for payment in the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless this Note could not have been presented for payment elsewhere, or (c) presented this Note for payment more than 30 days after the date on which the payment became due unless the Holder of this Note would have been entitled to these Additional Amounts if the Holder of this Note had presented this Note for payment within the 30-day period; (2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax or other governmental charge; (3) any tax or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld because of failure by the Holder of this Note to comply with any reasonable request by the Company: (a) to provide information concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder of this Note or that of the beneficial owner of this
 
Note; or (b) to make any claim or satisfy any information or reporting requirement, which in either case is required by the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of the tax or other governmental charge; or (4) any combination of items (1), (2) or (3) above.
The Company will not pay Additional Amounts if the Holder of this Note is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of this Note if the beneficiary or partner or settlor would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had it been the holder of this Note.
The Company will be entitled to redeem this Note, at its option, at any time as a whole but not in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date), in the event that the Company or the Guarantor has become or would become obligated to pay, on the next date on which any amount would be payable with respect to this Note, any Additional Amounts as a result of: (1) a change in or an amendment to the laws (including any regulations promulgated thereunder) of a Taxing Jurisdiction, which change or amendment is announced after February 7, 2008; or (2) any change in or amendment to any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws or regulations, which change or amendment is announced after February 7, 2008, and, in each case, the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid such obligation by taking reasonable measures available to it.
The Indenture contains provisions whereby (i) the Company and the Guarantor may be discharged from their obligations with respect to the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) or (ii) the Company and the Guarantor may be released from their obligations under specified covenants and agreements in the Indenture, in each case if the Company or the Guarantor irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Notes of this series, and satisfies certain other conditions, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements and instruments made and to be performed wholly within such State.
All terms used in this Note without definition that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefits under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

ACE INA Holdings Inc.
Registration Statement on Form S-3
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have represented ACE Limited ("ACE"), a Cayman Islands company limited by shares, and ACE INA Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ACE INA") in connection (i) with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") relating to, among other things ACE INA's Debt Securities, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by ACE and (ii) the offer and sale of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of ACE INA's 5.80% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes").
In rendering the opinions expressed herein, we have examined (i) the Indenture, dated as of August 1, 1999 (the "Indenture"), among ACE, ACE INA and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association and The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Trustee"); (ii) the Notes and (iii) the Guarantee.
In addition, we have examined such other documents, certificates and opinions, and have made such further investigation as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the opinions expressed below. In expressing the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the conformity to the originals of all documents reviewed by us as copies, the authenticity and completeness of all original documents reviewed by us in original or copy form and the legal competence of each individual executing any document. As to all parties other than ACE INA, we have assumed the due authorization, execution and delivery of all documents, and, with respect to all parties other than ACE INA and ACE, we have assumed the validity and enforceability of all documents against all parties thereto, other than the ACE INA and ACE, in accordance with their respective terms.

As to questions of fact material to our opinions (but not as to legal conclusions), we have, to the extent we deemed such reliance appropriate, relied upon certificates and other statements of officers of ACE INA and ACE and of public officials issued with respect to ACE INA and ACE.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and having regard for legal considerations which we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:
(i) ACE INA is duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware;
(ii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by ACE INA and (assuming the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by ACE and the Trustee), the Indenture constitutes a valid and binding agreement of ACE INA and ACE, enforceable against ACE INA and ACE in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
(iii) The Notes have been duly authorized and executed by ACE INA and, assuming the due authentication thereof in the manner provided for in the Indenture and delivery against payment of the consideration therefor, constitute valid and binding obligations of ACE INA, enforceable against ACE INA in accordance with their terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
(iv) Assuming the Guarantee has been duly authorized by ACE under Cayman Islands law, the Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of ACE enforceable against ACE in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
We are admitted to practice in the States of Illinois and New York and our opinions expressed herein are limited solely to the Federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the States of Illinois and New York, and we express no opinion herein concerning the laws of any other jurisdiction.
