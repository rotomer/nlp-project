Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 ACE Limited (NYSE: ACE) today reported net income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008, of $1.10 per common share after payment of preferred dividends, compared with $2.10 per share for the same quarter last year. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) for the first quarter was $2.16 per share, compared with $1.98 per share for the same quarter of last year.
HAMILTON, Bermuda, April 29, 2008
(1)
The first quarter was marked by unprecedented financial market volatility in both the credit and equity markets, which impacted net income and book value. The net realized and unrealized loss after tax was $650 million for the quarter. This loss is the result of market pricing changes only. Actual credit-related impairments included in this number were insignificant, at approximately $20 million. Book value increased $58 million for the quarter, and the annualized return on average equity was 17.7%.

Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented: "It was a busy and very good quarter for ACE. We closed two acquisitions  Combined Insurance and the Atlantic Companies' personal lines business  and we announced our intention to re-domesticate our holding company to Zurich, Switzerland. These moves speak to the medium- and long-term strategic positioning of our Company. We had a strong quarter in terms of operating performance, with net operating income up 9.5%. Net income, which was down, and book value growth, which was essentially flat, were negatively impacted by the unprecedented volatility experienced in the debt and equity markets during the quarter. The business climate has grown more difficult globally, including the broad economy and financial markets. Ironically, the P&C market continues to grow more competitive. Our balance sheet and income statement are strong, and in the face of these realities, we are well positioned to seek out and capitalize upon opportunities on both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet."
Other operating highlights were as follows:

is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in Other (income) expense related to partially-owned insurance companies because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities.
Operating Income or Income excluding net realized gains (losses), net of tax
is calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other (income) expense, interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.

Tangible shareholders' equity
