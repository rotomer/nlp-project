In connection with the anticipated re-domestication of ACE Limited (the "Company") to Switzerland, the Company entered into amendments and waivers to various credit facilities, effective as of July 10, 2008, to reflect the anticipated continuation of the Company as a Swiss company and to waive any potential default under any such credit facility that may have arisen upon the effectiveness of the re-domestication. See Exhibits 10.3 through 10.8 for copies of such amendments and waivers, which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
(e) On July 14, 2008, the ACE Limited 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended through the fourth amendment (the "LTIP"), was approved by the Company's shareholders. As a result of the fourth amendment, an additional 4 million shares are now available for awards under the LTIP. A more complete description of the LTIP is contained in Company's Proxy Statement/Prospectus dated May 30, 2008, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) on May 30, 2008, under the heading "Approval of ACE Limited 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan as Amended through the Fourth Amendment," which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. For the full text of the LTIP, see Exhibit 10.2 hereto, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
In addition, in connection with the Company's anticipated re-domestication to Switzerland, and for the sole purpose of documentation of work that is expected to be performed in Switzerland, the Company entered into employment agreements with Evan Greenberg, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Philip Bancroft, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, and Robert Cusumano, the Company's General Counsel. These employment agreements did not change these officers' responsibilities to the ACE group of companies or their aggregate compensation from the ACE group of companies. These employment agreements formally establish that the named executive officers who are parties thereto have responsibilities directly with ACE Limited as a Swiss company and will receive compensation specifically for work performed in Switzerland. These employment agreements specify that these officers (i) are employees of the Swiss parent company, (ii) shall receive compensation allocable to such employment agreement (as opposed to compensation allocable to their work for other ACE companies) that reflects 10% of the total compensation such named executive officer is currently receiving, and (iii) shall work a portion of their time in Switzerland for ACE Limited approximating 10% of their annual work calendar. The Company may use the same form of employment agreement for these officers to allocate a percentage of their salaries to other subsidiaries of the Company. The form of employment agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
. At the Company's reconvened annual general meeting on July 14, 2008, the Company's shareholders approved the balance of the proposals necessary to approve the Company's continuation in Zurich, Switzerland.

Exhibit 10.2
1.1. . The ACE Limited 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") has been established by ACE Limited (the "Company") to (i) attract and retain persons eligible to participate in the Plan; (ii) motivate Participants, by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve long-range goals; (iii) provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv) further identify Participants' interests with those of the Company's other shareholders through compensation that is based on the Company's ordinary shares of stock; and thereby promote the long-term financial interest of the Company and the Subsidiaries, including the growth in value of the Company's equity and enhancement of long-term shareholder return.
Purpose
1.2. . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate, from time to time, from among the Eligible Individuals (including transferees of Eligible Individuals to the extent the transfer is permitted by the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement), those persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the Plan, and thereby become "Participants" in the Plan.
Participation
1.3. . The operation and administration of the Plan, including the Awards made under the Plan, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5 (relating to operation and administration). Capitalized terms in the Plan shall be defined as set forth in the Plan (including the definition provisions of Section 9).
Operation, Administration, and Definitions
2.1. .
Definitions
 
 
2.2. . The "Exercise Price" of each Option and SAR granted under this Section 2 shall be established by the Committee or shall be determined by a method established by the Committee at the time the Option or SAR is granted. The Exercise Price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of grant (or, if greater, the par value of a share of Stock).
Exercise Price
2.3. . An Option and an SAR shall be exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions and during such periods as may be established by the Committee. In no event, however, shall an Option or SAR expire later than ten years after the date of its grant.
Exercise
 
2.4. . The payment of the Exercise Price of an Option granted under this Section 2 shall be subject to the following:
Payment of Option Exercise Price
 
 
 
2.5. . Settlement of Options and SARs is subject to subsection 5.7.
Settlement of Award
2.6. . Except for either adjustments pursuant to paragraph 5.2(f) (relating to the adjustment of shares), or reductions of the Exercise Price approved by the Company's shareholders, the Exercise Price for any outstanding Option or SAR may not be decreased after the date of grant nor may an outstanding Option or SAR granted under the Plan be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a replacement Option or SAR with a lower Exercise Price.
No Repricing
2.7. . An Option may but need not be in tandem with an SAR, and an SAR may but need not be in tandem with an Option. If an Option is in tandem with an SAR, the Exercise Price of both the Option and SAR shall be the same, and the exercise of the Option or SAR with respect to a share of Stock shall cancel the corresponding tandem SAR or Option right with respect to such share. If an SAR is in tandem with an Option but is granted after the grant of the Option, or if an Option is in tandem with an SAR but is granted after the grant of the SAR, the later granted tandem Award shall have the same Exercise Price as the earlier granted Award, but the Exercise Price for the later granted Award may be less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at the time of such grant.
Grants of Options and SARs
3.1. . A "Full Value" Award is a grant of one or more shares of Stock or a right to receive one or more shares of Stock in the future, with such grant subject to one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee:
Definition
 
 
 
The grant of Full Value Awards may also be subject to such other conditions, restrictions and contingencies, as determined by the Committee.
 
3.2. .
Restrictions on Awards
 
 
A Cash Incentive Award is the grant of a right to receive a payment of cash (or in the discretion of the Committee, Stock having value equivalent to the cash otherwise payable) that is contingent on achievement of performance or other objectives over a specified period established by the Committee. The grant of Cash Incentive Awards may also be subject to such other conditions, restrictions and contingencies, as determined by the Committee. The Committee may designate a Cash Incentive Award granted to any Participant as "performance-based compensation" as that term is used in section 162(m) of the Code. To the extent required by Code section 162(m), any such Award so designated shall be conditioned on the achievement of one or more performance objectives. The performance objectives shall be based on Performance Measures as selected by the Committee. For Awards under this Section 4 intended to be "performance-based compensation," the grant of the Awards and the establishment of the performance objectives shall be made during the period required under Code section 162(m). Except as otherwise provided in the applicable plan or arrangement, distribution of any cash incentive awards by the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether granted this Plan or otherwise), for a performance period ending in a calendar year, shall be made to the Participant not later than March 15 of the following calendar year; provided, however, that for purposes of determining compliance with Code section 409A, a payment will be considered to satisfy the requirement of this sentence if distribution is made no later than the end of the calendar year following the end of the applicable performance period.
5.1. . Subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company at the Company's 2004 annual meeting of its shareholders, the Plan shall be effective as of February 25, 2004 (the "Effective Date"); provided, however, that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange, Awards may be granted contingent on approval of the Plan by the shareholders of the Company at such annual meeting. The Plan shall be unlimited in duration and, in the event of Plan termination, shall remain in effect as long as any Awards under it are outstanding; provided, however, that no Awards may be granted under the Plan on or after the ten-year anniversary of July 10, 2008, which is the date on which the Plan was amended by the Fourth Amendment.
Effective Date
 
5.2. . The shares of Stock for which Awards may be granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following:
Shares and Other Amounts Subject to Plan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3. . Delivery of shares of Stock or other amounts under the Plan shall be subject to the following:
General Restrictions
 
 
5.4. . All distributions under the Plan are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and the Committee may condition the delivery of any shares or other benefits under the Plan on satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligations. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, such withholding obligations may be satisfied (i) through cash payment by the Participant; (ii) through the surrender of shares of Stock which the Participant already owns (provided, however, that to the extent shares described in this clause (ii) are used to satisfy more than the minimum statutory withholding obligation, as described below, then, except as otherwise provided by the Committee, payments made with shares of Stock in accordance with this clause (ii) shall be limited to shares held by the Participant for not less than six months prior to the payment date); or (iii) through the surrender of shares of Stock to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Plan, provided, however, that such shares under this clause (iii) may be used to satisfy not more than the Company's minimum statutory withholding obligation (based on minimum statutory withholding rates for Federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to such supplemental taxable income).
Tax Withholding
5.5. . In the discretion of the Committee, a Participant may be granted any Award permitted under the provisions of the Plan, and more than one Award may be granted to a Participant. Awards may be granted as alternatives to or replacement of awards granted or outstanding under the Plan, or any other plan or arrangement of the Company or a Subsidiary (including a plan or arrangement of a business or entity, all or a portion of which is acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary). Subject to the overall limitation on the number of shares of Stock that may be delivered under the Plan, the Committee may use available shares of Stock as the form of payment for compensation, grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary, including the plans and arrangements of the Company or
Grant and Use of Awards
 
a Subsidiary assumed in business combinations. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 2.2, Options and SARs granted under the Plan in replacement for awards under plans and arrangements of the Company or a Subsidiary assumed in business combinations may provide for Exercise Prices that are less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock at the time of the replacement grants, if the Committee determines that such Exercise Price is appropriate to preserve the economic benefit of the award. The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 5.16.
5.6. . An Award (including without limitation an Option or SAR Award) may provide the Participant with the right to receive dividend or dividend equivalent payments with respect to Stock subject to the Award (both before and after the Stock subject to the Award is earned, vested, or acquired), which payments may be either made currently or credited to an account for the Participant, and may be settled in cash or Stock, as determined by the Committee. Any such settlements, and any such crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents or reinvestment in shares of Stock, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish, including the reinvestment of such credited amounts in Stock equivalents. The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 5.16.
Dividends and Dividend Equivalents
5.7. . The obligation to make payments and distributions with respect to Awards may be satisfied through cash payments, the delivery of shares of Stock, the granting of replacement Awards (subject to subsection 2.6), or combination thereof as the Committee shall determine. Satisfaction of any such obligations under an Award, which is sometimes referred to as "settlement" of the Award, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or dividend equivalents, and may include converting such credits into deferred Stock equivalents. Except for Options and SARs designated at the time of grant or otherwise as intended to be subject to Code section 409A, this subsection 5.7 shall not be construed to permit the deferred settlement of Options or SARs, if such settlement would result in deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i)(A)(3) (except as permitted in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of that section). Each Subsidiary shall be liable for payment of cash due under the Plan with respect to any Participant to the extent that such benefits are attributable to the services rendered for that Subsidiary by the Participant. Any disputes relating to liability of a Subsidiary for cash payments shall be resolved by the Committee. The provisions of this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 5.16.
Settlement of Awards
5.8. . Awards under the Plan are not transferable except as designated by the Participant by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and except for transfers without consideration to the extent permitted by the Committee.
Transferability
5.9. . Unless otherwise specified herein, each election required or permitted to be made by any Participant or other person entitled to benefits under the Plan, and any permitted modification, or revocation thereof, shall be in writing filed with the Committee at such times, in such form, and subject to such restrictions and limitations, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall require.
Form and Time of Elections
5.10. . An Award under the Plan shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, prescribe. The terms and conditions of any Award to any Participant shall be reflected in such form of written (including electronic) document as is determined by the Committee. A copy of such document shall be provided to the Participant, and the Committee may, but need not require that the Participant sign a copy of such document. Such document is referred to in the Plan as an "Award Agreement" regardless of whether any Participant signature is required.
Agreement With Company
5.11. . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any Subsidiary shall be by resolution of its board of directors, or by action of one or more members of the board (including a committee of the board) who are duly authorized to act for the board, or (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of any stock exchange) by a duly authorized officer of such company.
Action by Company or Subsidiary
 
5.12. . Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include any other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular.
Gender and Number
5.13. .
Limitation of Implied Rights
 
 
5.14. . Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, Awards to a Participant (including the grant and the receipt of benefits) under the Plan shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the Participant's benefits under any Qualified Retirement Plan and other plans maintained by the Participant's employer. The term "Qualified Retirement Plan" means any plan of the Company or a Subsidiary that is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code.
Benefits Under Qualified Retirement Plans
5.15. . Evidence required of anyone under the Plan may be by certificate, affidavit, document or other information which the person acting on it considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made or presented by the proper party or parties.
Evidence
5.16. . The provisions of the Plan shall be subject to the following:
Limitations under Section 409A
 
 
 
 
Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5.2(f) (relating to the adjustment of shares), the occurrence of a Change in Control shall have the effect, if any, with respect to any Award as set forth in the Award Agreement or, to the extent not prohibited by the Plan or the Award Agreement, as provided by the Committee.
7.1. . The authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan shall be vested in a committee (the "Committee") in accordance with this Section 7. The Committee shall be selected by the Board, and shall consist solely of two or more members of the Board. If the Committee does not exist, or for any other reason determined by the Board, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange, the Board may take any action under the Plan that would otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee.
Administration
7.2. . The Committee's administration of the Plan shall be subject to the following:
Powers of Committee
 
 
 
 
 
7.3. . Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of a stock exchange, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it. Any such allocation or delegation may be revoked by the Committee at any time.
Delegation by Committee
7.4. . The Company and Subsidiaries shall furnish the Committee with such data and information as it determines may be required for it to discharge its duties. The records of the Company and Subsidiaries as to an employee's or Participant's employment (or other provision of services),

Participants and other persons entitled to benefits under the Plan must furnish the Committee such evidence, data or information as the Committee considers desirable to carry out the terms of the Plan.
The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the Plan, and may amend any Award Agreement, provided that no amendment or termination may, in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected Participant (or, if the Participant is not then living, the affected beneficiary), adversely affect the rights of any Participant or beneficiary under any Award granted under the Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Board; and further provided that adjustments pursuant to paragraph 5.2(f) shall not be subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 8; and further provided that the provisions of subsection 2.6 (relating to Option repricing) cannot be amended unless the amendment is approved by the Company's shareholders. Approval by the Company's shareholders will be required for any material revision to the terms of the Plan, with the Committee's determination of "material revision" to take into account the exemptions under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. No amendment or termination shall be adopted or effective if it would result in accelerated recognition of income or imposition of additional tax under Code section 409A or, except as otherwise provided in the amendment, would cause amounts that were not otherwise subject to Code section 409A to become subject to section 409A.
In addition to the other definitions contained herein, the following definitions shall apply:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the purpose of this definition of "Change in Control," (I) an "Affiliate" of a person or other entity shall mean a person or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the person or other entity specified and (II) "Voting Stock" shall mean capital stock of any class or classes having general voting power under ordinary circumstances, in the absence of contingencies, to elect the directors of a corporation.

1.4 Section 2.08 is amended by adding the following new clauses (d) and (e) at the end thereof:
(d) . The various rates of interest provided for in this Agreement are minimum interest rates. The parties hereto have assumed that interest at such rates is not and will not become subject to Swiss Withholding Tax. Notwithstanding that the parties hereto do not anticipate that any payment of interest will be subject to Swiss Withholding Tax, each Lender, the Parent and the Administrative Agent agree that if Swiss Withholding Tax is imposed on any interest payment by the Parent to any Lender and it is unlawful for any reason for the Parent to comply with Section 2.13 when it would otherwise be required to make any payment under such Section, then any payment of interest to be made by the Parent to such Lender shall be increased to an amount which (after making any deduction of the Non-refundable Portion of Swiss Withholding Tax as defined below) results in a payment to such Lender of an amount equal to the payment which would have been due had no deduction of Swiss Withholding Tax been required.

Ten Non-Bank Rule and Twenty Non-Bank Rule
provided
1.7 Section 9.06(b) is amended by (a) adding "(i)" in the third sentence thereof immediately after the phrase "participating interest shall provide that" and (b) adding the following text before the period at the end of such sentence:

If any Lender makes any Transfer in violation of this Section 9.06(f), then (1) such Lender shall reimburse and indemnify the Parent for all losses, liabilities, taxes, costs and expenses incurred as a result thereof and (2) the Parent shall not be required to make any increased payment to such Lender or the applicable Transferee pursuant to Section 2.08(d) or Section 2.13. The provisions of this Section 9.06(f) shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if the Advances, all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents have become forthwith due and payable (at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise).

Promptly after any such request, the Parent and the Administrative Agent shall enter into discussions regarding an amendment hereto that will place the parties hereto in substantially the same position (or in a different position acceptable to the Parent and the Required Lenders) from a Swiss Withholding Tax perspective as they would have been in if the change had not happened. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Parent agrees that it will promptly agree to any amendment requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders that would ease the restrictions set forth in Section 9.06(f) if such amendment would not result in any greater risk that Swiss Withholding Tax would be applicable to any payment under this Agreement;
Certain Swiss Withholding Tax Matters
 
and (ii) the Lenders and the Administrative Agent agree that they will promptly agree to any amendment requested by the Parent that would change the restrictions set forth in Section 9.06(f) if such amendment is necessary to avoid the risk that Swiss Withholding Tax would be applicable to any payment under this Agreement and is not unduly burdensome to the Lenders.
(b) Each Lender agrees that it will, and will cause any Person to which it sells any participation to, promptly notify the Parent and the Administrative Agent if for any reason it ceases to be a Qualifying Lender. Without limiting the foregoing, if at any time the Parent reasonably believes that any Lender's status for Swiss Withholding Tax purposes has changed, then the Parent may request that such Lender (and each Lender agrees that under such circumstances it will) promptly confirm whether it is a Qualifying Lender or a Non-Qualifying Lender.
