Ladies and Gentlemen:
     ACE INA Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell up to $500,000,000 aggregate initial public offering price, or its equivalent based on the applicable exchange rate at the time of offering in such foreign or composite currencies as the Company shall designate at the time of offering, of its senior or subordinated debt securities (the "Debt Securities"), from time to time, in or pursuant to one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale. The Debt Securities will be unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest by ACE Limited, a Swiss company (the "Guarantor").
     The Debt Securities will be issued in one or more series as senior indebtedness (the "Senior Debt Securities") under an indenture, dated as of August 1, 1999 (the "Senior Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association and The First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the "Senior Trustee"), or as subordinated indebtedness (the "Subordinated Debt Securities") under an indenture (the "Subordinated Indenture", and collectively with the Senior Indenture, the "Indentures", and each, an "Indenture"), dated as of December 1, 1999 among the Company, the Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Subordinated Trustee", and collectively with the Senior Trustee, the "Trustees", and each, a "Trustee"). Each series of Debt Securities may vary, as applicable, as to title, aggregate principal amount, rank, interest rate or formula and timing of payments thereof, stated maturity date, redemption and/or repayment provisions, sinking fund requirements, conversion or exchange provisions and any other variable terms established by or pursuant to the applicable Indenture.
     Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Debt Securities, the Company and the Guarantor will enter into an agreement (each, a "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such Debt Securities to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, the underwriters specified in the Terms Agreement (the "Underwriters", which term shall include any Underwriter substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof). The Terms Agreement relating to the
 
offering of Debt Securities shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities to be issued (the "Underwritten Securities"), the name of each Underwriter participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided in Section 10 hereof) and the name of any Underwriter acting as co-manager in connection with such offering, the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities that each such Underwriter severally agrees to purchase, whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis and, if on a fixed price basis, the initial offering price, the price at which the Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the form, time, date and place of delivery and payment of the Underwritten Securities and any other material variable terms of the Underwritten Securities. The Terms Agreement, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, may take the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Company and one or more of the Underwriters, acting for themselves and, if applicable, as representative(s) of any other Underwriters. Each offering of Underwritten Securities will be governed by this Underwriting Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Terms Agreement. As used herein, the term "Representative(s)" means, with respect to any offering of Debt Securities, any Underwriter(s) specified as the representative(s) of the Underwriters of such offering in the applicable Terms Agreement and if none is so designated, it means the Underwriters.
     The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a joint automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-156143), for the registration of the Debt Securities and the guarantee thereof of the Guarantor (the "Guarantee") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"). Such registration statement became effective automatically upon filing on December 15, 2008, each Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"), and the Company and the Guarantor have filed such post-effective amendments to such registration statement as may be required prior to the execution of the applicable Terms Agreement and each such post-effective amendment became effective automatically upon filing with the Commission. At any given time, such registration statement (as so amended, if applicable, to such time), including any required information deemed to be a part thereof at such time pursuant to Rule 430B under the 1933 Act (the "Rule 430B Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement"; and the final base prospectus or prospectuses and the final prospectus supplement relating to the offering of the Underwritten Securities, in the form first furnished to the Underwriters by the Company and the Guarantor for use in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities, are collectively referred to herein as the "Prospectus"; provided, however, that at any given time references to the "Registration Statement" and the "Prospectus" shall also be deemed to include all documents incorporated therein by reference pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), as of, in the case of the Registration Statement, such given date, or, in the case of the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus. A "preliminary prospectus" shall be deemed to refer to any prospectus used before the Registration Statement became effective and any prospectus that omitted information to be included upon pricing in a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations and was used after such effectiveness and prior to the relevant Applicable Time (as defined in the applicable Terms Agreement), including in each case any base prospectus so used and the documents incorporated by reference therein. For purposes of this Underwriting Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
 
preliminary prospectus or to any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (also known as Interactive Data Electronic Applications) system ("EDGAR").

Indemnification of Underwriters.
     (1) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the Final Term Sheet, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (2) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that (subject to Section 6(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantor; and
     (3) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the Representative(s)), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
 
statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (1) or (2) above;
, , that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor, their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the Rule 430B Information deemed to be a part thereof or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representative(s) expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
Indemnification of Company, Guarantor, Directors and Officers.
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Representative(s), and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Guarantor. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified
Actions against Parties; Notification.
 
party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(2) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse.
     SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Underwritten Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of such Underwritten Securities as set forth on such cover.
     The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by
 
an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company and the Guarantor, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Initial Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement, and not joint.
     SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Underwritten Securities.

Termination
     (a) The Representative(s) may terminate this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement, by notice to the Company and the Guarantor, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, if (i) there has been, since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, any material adverse change, or any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the financial condition, business or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) there has been, since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change, or any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the financial condition, business or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary
Terms Agreement.
 
course of business, (iii) there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case referred to in this clause (iii), the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative(s), impracticable or inadvisable to market the Underwritten Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Underwritten Securities, (iv) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Guarantor or the Company or the insurance claims paying ability rating or other insurance rating of the Guarantor or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, in each case by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436 (g) under the 1933 Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Guarantor or the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating) or of the insurance claims paying ability or other insurance rating of the Guarantor or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (v) trading in any securities of the Company or the Guarantor has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by either of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the FINRA or any other governmental authority or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (vi) a banking moratorium has been declared by either U.S. Federal, New York or Bermuda authorities or, if the Underwritten Securities are denominated or payable in, or indexed to, one or more foreign or composite currencies, by the relevant authorities in the related foreign country or countries.
     (b) If this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7 and 8 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Liabilities.
     SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase the Underwritten Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representative(s) shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representative(s) shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:
Default by One or More of the Underwriters
     (a) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting
 
obligations under such Terms Agreement bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
     (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Underwritten Securities to be purchased on such date pursuant to such Terms Agreement, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either the Representative(s) or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
     SECTION 11. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to the Representatives at the address specified in the applicable Terms Agreement; notices to the Company shall be directed to it at 436 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106, attention of General Counsel; and notices to the Guarantor shall be directed to it at Brengasse 32, Zurich, Switzerland CH-8001, attention of General Counsel and Secretary.

The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be June 1 or December 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder hereof on the relevant regular record date by virtue of having been such Holder, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a subsequent special record date (which shall be at least 10 days before the payment date) for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Company, notice whereof shall be given to the Holders of Notes of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in such Indenture. Any interest paid on this Note shall be increased to the extent necessary to pay Additional Amounts as set forth in this Note.
     Payment of the principal of, interest on or any Redemption Price or Additional Amounts in respect of this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company and the Guarantor (as defined below) maintained for that purpose in The Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that, at the option of the Company or the Guarantor, interest may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register; provided, further, that payment to DTC or any successor Depository may be made by wire transfer to the account designated by DTC or such successor depository in writing.
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issuance of securities of the Company (herein called the "Notes"), fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest by ACE Limited, a Swiss corporation () (the "Guarantor"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of August 1, 1999 (herein called, together with all indentures supplemental thereto, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to J.P.

     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations set forth therein and in this Note, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Security Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company and the Guarantor maintained for that purpose in any place where the principal of, interest on or any Additional Amounts in respect of this Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield-to-maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.

     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc. and RBS Securities Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City, which we refer to as a "Primary Treasury Dealer," the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Independent Investment Banker after consultation with the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     All payments on this Note will be made without withholding of any present or future taxes or governmental charges of the jurisdiction of the Company's organization or principal executive offices (each, a "Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the Company is required to do so by applicable law or regulation.

either case is required by the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of the tax or other governmental charge; or (4) any combination of items (1), (2) or (3) above.
     The Company will not pay Additional Amounts if the Holder of this Note is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of this Note if the beneficiary or partner or settlor would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had it been the holder of this Note.

     The Indenture contains provisions whereby (i) the Company and the Guarantor may be discharged from their obligations with respect to the Notes (subject to certain exceptions) or (ii) the Company and the Guarantor may be released from their obligations under specified covenants and agreements in the Indenture, in each case if the Company or the Guarantor irrevocably deposits with the Trustee money or Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Notes of this series, and satisfies certain other conditions, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
     This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements and instruments made and to be performed wholly within such State.
     All terms used in this Note without definition that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
     Unless the Certificate of Authentication hereon has been executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefits under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have represented ACE Limited ("ACE"), a Swiss company limited by shares (), and ACE INA Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ACE INA") in connection (i) with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-156143) (the "Registration Statement") relating to, among other things ACE INA's debt securities, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by ACE and (ii) the offer and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of ACE INA's 5.90% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Notes").
