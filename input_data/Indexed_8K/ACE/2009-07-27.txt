Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, stated: "ACE had a very good second quarter and an excellent first half. Book value increased $1.8 billion or 12% in the quarter, benefiting from improved financial market conditions and strong earnings. Book value is now up 14% year to date, recovering completely from losses suffered during the financial market stress in the second half of last year. In the quarter we produced after-tax operating income of $706 million, our return on equity was 18% and our P&C combined ratio was 87.7%.
"Recession, a strong U.S. dollar and a competitive pricing environment impacted premium growth. For our portfolio of business, rates continued to firm and a number of our divisions benefited such as our ACE Tempest Re reinsurance franchise, where net premiums grew over 20% in the quarter. Moreover, many of our retail P&C insurance lines around the world experienced good growth as a result of continued customer flight to safety.
"We remain cautious given current economic and financial market conditions, but we are aggressively focused on execution, and we continue to make investments to expand our capabilities for the future. We are well positioned to build market share as insurance markets improve and economic growth slowly recovers."
Other operating highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, were as follows

With this conservative loan-to-value ratio and subordinated collateral of 12%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 18% and real estate values would have to fall 31% from their current levels before principal is impaired.

With subordinated collateral of 19%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 29% and real estate values would have to fall more than 31% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The comparable historical cumulative foreclosure rate is approximately 10%.

The comparable historical cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate is 32%.
Sub-prime asset-backed securities

The portfolio is comprised of over 500 issuers with our largest current issuer exposure at $65 million. ACE monitors position limits on a daily basis through an internal compliance system.
 
Derivative and structured securities (e.g. credit default swaps, CLOs) are not permitted in high yield portfolios.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per share is provided on page 31.
 
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses).
 
The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related tax expense (benefit). We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned insurance companies because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
