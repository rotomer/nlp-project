The press release and the financial supplement are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
DATE: October 27, 2009
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 ACE Limited (NYSE: ACE) today reported net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, of $1.46 per share, compared with $0.16 per share for the same quarter last year.
ZURICH, Switzerland, October 27, 2009
(1)
Income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $2.07 per share, compared with $1.50 per share.
(2)
Net realized and unrealized gains after tax were $1.4 billion for the quarter. Book value increased $2.2 billion during the quarter, up 13% from June 30, 2009. Book value per share now stands at $55.71. Annualized return on average equity was 15.9%.
(3)
The property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio was 88.1%.
 
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, was $4.73 per share, compared with $3.45 per share for 2008. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $6.16 per share, compared with $5.81 per share for 2008. The P&C combined ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, was 87.8%. Book value increased $4.3 billion, up 30% during the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
 
Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented: "ACE had an excellent third quarter with all divisions of the company performing well and contributing to results. Our book value grew 13% in the quarter, 30% for the year, and stands at an all-time high. After-tax operating income increased 39% from the same period last year, and our return on equity was 16%.
"Our P&C combined ratio was 88.1% and benefited from positive prior period reserve development and light catastrophe losses in the period. Excluding those items, our current accident year combined ratio for the quarter and the year was 93.3% and 91.4%, respectively  again, an excellent result. In addition, as a result of our underwriting discipline, while we sacrificed some growth, we achieved positive rate change in the quarter of about 2%.
"Premium revenue growth was impacted in the quarter by recessionary conditions, a strong U.S. dollar and a competitive insurance market. Growth in the period benefited, however, from customers seeking ACE's strong balance sheet as well as our broad product portfolio and global presence. By the nature of some of our businesses, growth can be volatile quarter to quarter, but more stable when viewed over a longer period of time. In fact, we expect meaningfully stronger revenue growth in the fourth quarter regardless of foreign exchange."
Other operating highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, were as follows

total $11.2 billion, are rated predominantly AAA and comprise 26% of the fixed income portfolio. This compares to a 41% mortgage-backed weighting in representative indices of the U.S. fixed income market. The minimum rating for initial purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities is AAA.
Mortgage-backed securities

Securities issued by Federal agencies
 
are backed by prime collateral, and broadly diversified in over 280,000 loans. The portfolio's loan-to-value ratio is approximately 70% with an average FICO score of 732. With this conservative loan-to-value ratio and subordinated collateral of 13%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 20% and real estate values would have to fall 30% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The comparable historical cumulative foreclosure rate is 8% for prime mortgages.
Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
 
Within the portfolio of prime non-agency RMBS are $157 million of holdings classified as ALT-A. These ALT-A holdings are broadly diversified with over 60% issued prior to 2006. The average FICO score is 714 with a relatively conservative loan-to-value ratio of 72%. With subordinated collateral of 21%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 32% and real estate values would have to fall more than 27% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The comparable cumulative foreclosure rate is approximately 30%.
 
of $2.1 billion are rated predominantly AAA, broadly diversified with over 25,000 loans and seasoned with 73% of the portfolio issued before 2006. The average loan-to-value ratio is approximately 66% with a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.7 and weighted average subordinated collateral of 27%. The cumulative foreclosure rate would have to rise to 42% and commercial real estate values would have to fall more than 30% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The current annual delinquency rate is 4%.
Commercial mortgage-backed securities
 
(current holdings of $55 million) are broadly diversified in over 90,000 loans with an average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 81% and an average FICO score of 600. With subordinated collateral of 30%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 45% and real estate values would have to fall more than 19% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The comparable historical cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate is 32%.
Sub-prime asset-backed securities
 
are rated predominantly AAA with a short duration of approximately 0.5 years and average subordinated collateral of 17%. Annual default rates would have to rise to 16 times their current level of about 2.4% before principal is impaired.

Below Investment Grade Corporate Fixed income Portfolio

Four external investment managers are responsible for high yield security selection and portfolio construction.
 
ACE's high yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience.
 
Securities holdings are highly diversified across industries and are subject to a 1.5% issuer limit as a percentage of high yield allocation (or 0.1% of total portfolio). The portfolio is comprised of over 500 issuers with our largest current issuer exposure at $68 million. ACE monitors position limits on a daily basis through an internal compliance system.
 
Derivative and structured securities (e.g. credit default swaps, CLOs) are not permitted in high yield portfolios.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per common share is provided on page 27.
 
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses).
 
The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related tax expense (benefit). We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
