At ACE Limited's annual general meeting, the company's shareholders approved a dividend in the form of a par value reduction payable in four quarterly installments. The dividend approval provides for an annual par value reduction of 1.36 Swiss francs (CHF), which was equal to US$1.24 per share, or $0.31 per quarter, at the time of the annual general meeting. The actual CHF amount for each installment, however, will be adjusted up or down to equal $0.31 near the time of payment, subject to an aggregate cap for the four installments of CHF 2.04, as further described in the company's proxy statement/prospectus dated April 7, 2009.
For the third of such installments, in accordance with the shareholder approval, the par value reduction amount was fixed at CHF 0.32 based on the published USD/CHF exchange rate on December 14, 2009 (1.0341). To accomplish such installment, the company adjusted its Articles of Association on December 16, 2009 to reflect the number of shares issued out of conditional share capital since September 29, 2009, and on December 17, 2009 to confirm the par value reduction of CHF 0.32. The company's amended and restated Articles of Association became effective upon their filing with the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland on December 17, 2009, and as a result, the company's par value is CHF 31.88 as of such date.
Accordingly, the dividend scheduled for payment on January 11, 2010 will be paid to the company's shareholders of record at the close of business on December 17, 2009, as anticipated. A copy of the amended and restated Articles of Association is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
