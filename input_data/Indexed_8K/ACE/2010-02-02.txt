(

)
The property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio for the quarter was 89.6%.
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $7.55 per share, compared with $3.50 per share for 2008. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $8.17 per share, compared with $7.67 per share for 2008. Full year return on average equity was 16.2%. Book value increased $5.2 billion, up 36% for the year. The P&C combined ratio was 88.3% for the year.
 
Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented: "ACE had very strong fourth quarter income. Operating income was up 9% over prior year, contributing to record income for the year, and net income exceeded $900 million for the quarter. Our book value grew 36% in the year while tangible book grew 47%; both are now at all-time highs. In fact, over the last five years, we have grown our book and tangible book value at a compound annual rate of 15% and 17%, respectively.
"Our P&C combined ratio for 2009 was 88.3%  a world-class result  and in terms of capital efficiency, we achieved an operating return on equity for the year of more than 16%. We are confident we can continue to produce superior ROEs barring unforeseen events.
"P&C net written premiums were up about 9% in the quarter  a very solid performance that reflects the benefit of foreign exchange. While premium revenue growth will continue to be impacted by recessionary and competitive insurance market conditions, we are seeing more opportunities for profitable growth as a result of our increased geographic and product presence.
"In spite of the year's challenging economic, financial and insurance market conditions, we continued to invest in our company and benefit from our local presence in over 50 countries, from customer and producer flight to quality and capability, and from our diversified mix of P&C, A&H and Life businesses. We fully expect to continue delivering superior results."
Other operating highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, were as follows

total $11.3 billion, are rated predominantly AAA and comprise 25% of the fixed income portfolio. This compares to a 40% mortgage-backed weighting in representative indices of the U.S. fixed income market. The minimum rating for initial purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities is AAA.
Mortgage-backed securities

Securities issued by Federal agencies
 
are backed by prime collateral, and broadly diversified in over 260,000 loans. The portfolio's loan-to-value ratio is approximately 70% with an average FICO score of 730. With this conservative loan-to-value ratio and subordinated collateral of 13%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 20% and real estate values would have to fall 30% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The comparable historical cumulative foreclosure rate is 8% for prime mortgages.
Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
 
Within the portfolio of prime non-agency RMBS are $146 million of holdings classified as ALT-A. These ALT-A holdings are broadly diversified with over 60% issued prior to 2006. The average FICO score is 712 with a relatively conservative loan-to-value ratio of 72%. With subordinated collateral of 21%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 32% and real estate values would have to fall more than 27% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The comparable cumulative foreclosure rate is approximately 30%.
 
of $2.0 billion are rated predominantly AAA, broadly diversified with over 23,000 loans and seasoned with 73% of the portfolio issued before 2006. The average loan-to-value ratio is approximately 67% with a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.6 and weighted average subordinated collateral of 27%. The cumulative foreclosure rate would have to rise to 42% and commercial real estate values would have to fall more than 10% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The current annual delinquency rate is 9%.
Commercial mortgage-backed securities
 
(current holdings of $54 million) are broadly diversified in over 86,000 loans with an average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 81% and an average FICO score of 600. With subordinated collateral of 30%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 35% and real estate values would have to fall more than 18% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The comparable historical cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate is 32%.
Sub-prime asset-backed securities
 
are rated predominantly AAA with a short duration of approximately 0.5 years and average subordinated collateral of 20%. Annual default rates would have to rise to 17 times their current level of about 2.4% before principal is impaired.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per common share is provided on the next page.
 
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses).
 
The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related tax expense (benefit). We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
