Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
At the Company's 2009 annual general meeting, the company's shareholders approved a dividend in the form of a par value reduction payable in four quarterly installments. The dividend approval provides for an annual par value reduction of 1.36 Swiss francs (CHF), which was equal to US$1.24 per share, or $0.31 per quarter, at the time of the annual general meeting. The actual CHF amount for each installment, however, will be adjusted up or down to equal $0.31 near the time of payment, subject to an aggregate cap for the four installments of CHF 2.04, as further described in the company's proxy statement dated April 7, 2009.
For the fourth of such installments, in accordance with the shareholder approval, the par value reduction amount was fixed at CHF 0.33 based on the published USD/CHF exchange rate of 0.9312 on March 26, 2010. To accomplish such installment, the company adjusted its Articles of Association (a) on March 29, 2010 to reflect the number of shares issued out of conditional share capital since December 16, 2010, and (b) on March 31, 2010 to confirm the par value reduction of CHF 0.33. The company's amended and restated Articles of Association became effective upon their filing with the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland on March 31, 2010 and, as a result, the company's par value is CHF 31.55 as of such date.
Accordingly, the dividend scheduled for payment on April 13, 2010 will be paid to the company's shareholders of record at the close of business on March 31, 2010, as anticipated. A copy of the amended and restated Articles of Association is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 and incorporated herein by reference.
