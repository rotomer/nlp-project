Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On April 28, 2010, ACE Limited issued a press release reporting its first quarter 2010 results and the availability of its first quarter 2010 financial supplement. The press release and the financial supplement are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01.     Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
DATE: April 28, 2010
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 ACE Limited (NYSE: ACE) today reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, of $2.22 per share, compared with $1.69 per share for the same quarter last year.
ZURICH, April 28, 2010
(1)
Income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $1.70 per share, compared with $1.99 per share for the same quarter last year.

)
Net after-tax catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2010 were $149 million, including reinstatement premiums, compared with $34 million for the first quarter of 2009. The total catastrophe losses are an increase from the $125 million in after-tax losses reported on March 18, entirely due to the addition of late-quarter storms in Perth, Australia, and the northeastern United States. Book value increased $969 million during the quarter, up 5% from December 31, 2009. Book value per share now stands at $60.94, an increase of 4%. Annualized operating return on average equity for the quarter was 12.0%.

)
The property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio for the quarter was 92.8%.
 
Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented: "ACE had a good first quarter and start to 2010. We produced strong operating results and grew book value per share by 4%. Our operating ROE was 12.0%.
"While the quarter was marked by an unusually large number of natural catastrophes globally, we recorded an excellent combined ratio of 92.8%, with catastrophe losses representing about six points on the combined ratio and less than 1% of book value. I believe this demonstrates ACE's underwriting discipline, risk management, and broad product and geographic diversification.
"We face the challenging effects of a slow economic recovery as well as a competitive insurance market. The fundamentals of our company, however, are good and we are well positioned. We had a current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes of 90.2% and grew net premiums written 4%, aided by a steady customer renewal retention rate of 88% and a positive foreign exchange impact. In spite of the challenging economic and market conditions, we see meaningful opportunity in many places around the world where we have both capability and presence."
Operating highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, were as follows

is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in Other income (expense) related to partially-owned entities because the amounts of these gains (losses) do not relate to their respective operations.
Operating Income or Income excluding net realized gains (losses), net of tax
is calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other income (expense), interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). Life underwriting income includes net investment income. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.

With this conservative loan-to-value ratio and subordinated collateral of 13%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 21% and real estate values would have to fall 20% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The current foreclosure rate of ACE's non-agency RMBS portfolio is 9%.
Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
 
of $1.6 billion are rated predominantly AAA, broadly diversified with over 19,000 loans and seasoned with 86% of the portfolio issued before 2006. The average loan-to-value ratio is approximately 66% with a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.6 and weighted average subordinated collateral of 33%. The cumulative foreclosure rate would have to rise to 41% and commercial real estate values would have to fall more than 10% from their current levels before principal is impaired.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per common share is provided on the next page.
 
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses).
 
The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related tax expense (benefit). We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
