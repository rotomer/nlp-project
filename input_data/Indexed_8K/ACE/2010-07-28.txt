Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2010, was $4.21 per share, compared with $3.27 per share for 2009. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $3.72 per share, compared with $4.08 per share for 2009.

Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented:
"ACE had an excellent second quarter and first half. In the quarter, we produced operating income of $688 million and grew book value per share by almost 4%, and 8% year to date. Our operating ROE for the quarter was 13.8%.
"For the industry, this was an active quarter for natural catastrophes in the U.S., and for ACE, our total catastrophe losses were double the amount from the prior year. I believe our combined ratio of 89.7% speaks to our risk management, balance of operations, overall reserve strength and underlying underwriting performance.
"Slow economic recovery in the major developed economies of the United States, Europe and Japan and competitive global insurance markets impacted total premium growth, and I expect these conditions will be with us for some time. However, we continue to identify and realize opportunities for profitable growth as a result of our on-the-ground local presence globally and a broad specialty-oriented product capability.
"We are affirming the guidance we provided in January, which was $6.25 - $6.75 per share of operating income, and now expect to be at the top end of the range."
Operating highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, were as follows

is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in Other income (expense) related to partially-owned entities because the amounts of these gains (losses) do not relate to their respective operations.
Operating Income or Income excluding net realized gains (losses), net of tax
 
is calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other income (expense), interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). Life underwriting income includes net investment income. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
Underwriting income
See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 26 in the Financial Supplement. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

with implied or explicit government guarantees total $9.1 billion and represent 87% of the residential mortgage-backed portfolio.
Securities issued by Federal agencies
 
are backed by prime collateral, and broadly diversified in over 240,000 loans. The portfolio's loan-to-value ratio is approximately 70% with an average FICO score of 730. With this conservative loan-to-value ratio and subordinated collateral of 13%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 20% and real estate values would have to fall 19% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The current foreclosure rate of ACE's non-agency RMBS portfolio is 9%.
Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
 
of $1.5 billion are rated predominantly AAA, broadly diversified with over 18,500 loans and seasoned with 85% of the portfolio issued before 2006. The average loan-to-value ratio is approximately 66% with a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.7 and weighted average subordinated collateral of 33%. The cumulative foreclosure rate would have to rise to 41% and commercial real estate values would have to fall more than 10% from their current levels before principal is impaired. The current foreclosure rate of the portfolio is about 2%.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per common share is provided on the next page.
 
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses).
 
The following non-GAAP measure is a common performance measurement and is defined as income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related tax expense (benefit). We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
