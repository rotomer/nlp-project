On July 26, 2011, ACE Limited issued a press release reporting its second quarter 2011 results and the availability of its second quarter 2011 financial supplement. The press release and the financial supplement are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
DATE: July 26, 2011
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 ACE Limited (NYSE: ACE) today reported net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 of $1.77 per share, compared with $1.98 per share for the same quarter last year
ZURICH, July 26, 2011
(1)
; income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $2.01 per share for both periods.
(2)
Book value increased $737 million during the quarter, up 3% from March 31, 2011. Book value per share stands at $71.36. Annualized operating return on average equity for the quarter was 12.3%.
(3)
The property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio for the quarter was 92.6%.
 
 
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was $2.54 per share, compared with $4.21 per share for the same period in 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $2.80 per share, compared with $3.72 per share for 2010. Book value increased $1.1 billion, up 5% from December 31, 2010. The P&C combined ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2011, was 98.4%.
 
 
 
Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented: "ACE had an excellent second quarter. Operating income was $686 million and our ROE was approximately 12.5%. Book value and book value per share grew 3% in the quarter and are up 5% and 4%, respectively, for the year.
 
"For the industry, this was another difficult quarter for natural catastrophes, while the challenges of a competitive insurance market globally and sluggish economic conditions in developed markets continue to weigh on growth. In contrast, our strategy of investing for growth, both organically and through acquisition, while resolutely maintaining underwriting discipline, continues to distinguish our company in terms of revenue growth, earnings and risk management. Our P&C net premiums grew 15% in the quarter while our combined ratio was 92.6%, which included net catastrophe losses of just over $100 million.
 
"Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we are confident we will achieve double-digit revenue growth and meet or exceed our updated earnings projections. We are well positioned to capitalize on a modestly improving commercial P&C pricing environment. In light of what we now know, we are raising full-year guidance to $6.00 - $6.20 per share of after-tax operating income from $5.40 - $5.70 per share projected at the end of last quarter."
 
Operating highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, were as follows:

Financial Supplement,
 
The company is increasing earnings guidance for full-year 2011 as a result of actual experience in the second quarter, a projected higher run rate for investment income and a projected increase in underwriting results for the second half.

This includes $544 million after-tax in catastrophe losses for the first half, plus $200 million after-tax in catastrophe losses for the balance of the year. The guidance also includes $187 million of after-tax positive prior period development reflected in the first half.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
 
is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in Other income (expense) related to partially-owned entities because the amounts of these gains (losses) do not relate to their respective operations.
Operating Income or Income excluding net realized gains (losses), net of tax
 
is calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other income (expense), interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). Life underwriting income includes net investment income. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
Underwriting income
See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 27 in the financial supplement. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
(3)
Calculated using income excluding net realized gains (losses) divided by average shareholders' equity for the period excluding unrealized gains (losses) on investments and the deferred tax component included in shareholders' equity. To annualize a quarterly rate, multiply by four.
(4)
Book value per common share is shareholders' equity divided by the shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the shares outstanding.

of $1.5 billion are rated predominantly AAA, broadly diversified with over 16,000 loans and seasoned with 67% of the portfolio issued before 2006 and 19% of the portfolio issued after 2009.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per common share is provided on the next page.
 
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses).
 
Income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related tax expense (benefit) is a common performance measurement and non-GAAP measure. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
