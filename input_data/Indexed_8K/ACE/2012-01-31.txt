Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 31, 2012, ACE Limited issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter 2011 results and the availability of its fourth quarter 2011 Financial Supplement. The press release and the Financial Supplement are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 ACE Limited (NYSE: ACE) today reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, of $2.20 per share, compared with $2.92 per share for the same quarter last year;
ZURICH  January 31, 2012
(1)
income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $1.94 per share, compared with $2.05 per share for the same quarter last year.
(
2)
Book value and tangible book value increased 3% and 4%, respectively, in the quarter. Book value and tangible book value per share now stand at $72.76 and $58.43, respectively. Annualized operating return on equity for the quarter was 11.8%.
(2)
The property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio for the quarter was 92.9%.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income was $4.65 per share, compared with $9.11 per share for 2010; income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $6.97 per share, compared with $7.79 per share for 2010. Book value increased $1.5 billion, up 7% from December 31, 2010, while tangible book value increased $1.4 billion, up 8%. Operating return on equity for the year was 10.7%. The P&C combined ratio for the year was 94.6%.
 
Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented: "ACE had a very good fourth quarter and year given the record natural catastrophe losses the industry incurred globally. The financial results once again demonstrated our conservative approach to risk management and underwriting as well as the benefits of a well-diversified global spread of business. After-tax operating income for the year was $2.4 billion, our operating ROE was nearly 11% and we produced a combined ratio of 94.6%. Per share book value grew 6% for the year, bringing three-year compound annual growth to almost 19%.
"Net premiums written grew 6% in the quarter and 12% for the year, driven primarily by our recent acquisitions, our global accident and health insurance business, our P&C business in Asia and Latin America, and our focused portfolio management approach to risk selection in our commercial P&C portfolio. Beginning in the third quarter, accelerating in the fourth and going into January, our commercial P&C business began to benefit from a firming market, where insurance prices in the U.S. and select markets overseas began to rise. Rates strengthened in most property and casualty classes in the U.S., with greater increases taking hold in classes where combined ratios are under significant industry stress.
"Our long-pursued strategy is to achieve product and geographic diversification on a global scale while maintaining underwriting discipline and trading market share for underwriting profit. This has given us greater balance between those product areas exposed to the P&C pricing cycle and those that are not. We continue to pursue opportunities for profitable growth in our businesses around the globe and we are well positioned to continue to do so into the future."
Operating highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, and full year were as follows:

Financial Supplement
The company is issuing 2012 guidance. Operating income is expected to range between $6.65 and $7.05 per share. Catastrophe losses included in the estimate are $475 million pre-tax ($385 million after-tax), which is up from last year's catastrophe loss guidance of $370 million pre-tax ($300 million after-tax). The operating income projections included in this guidance are for current accident year results only and by definition do not include any estimate for prior period reserve development. The company's $6.85 per share guidance midpoint compares to the actual 2011 accident year result of $5.68 per share and 2011 original guidance midpoint of $6.30 per share.

is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially-owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities.
Operating income or income excluding net realized gains (losses), net of tax
is calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other income (expense), interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). Life underwriting income includes net investment income and gains (losses) from separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). P&C underwriting income and consolidated underwriting income are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
Underwriting income
is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ROE numerator includes income adjusted to exclude net realized gains (losses). The ROE denominator includes the average shareholders' equity for the period adjusted to exclude unrealized gains (losses) on investments and the deferred tax component included in shareholders' equity. To annualize a quarterly rate, multiply by four. Annualized ROE calculated using income excluding realized gains (losses) is a useful measure as it enhances the understanding of the return on shareholders' equity by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders' equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.
Annualized operating return on equity (ROE) or annualized ROE calculated using income excluding net realized gains (losses)
is shareholders' equity divided by the shares outstanding.
Book value per common share
is shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the shares outstanding.
Tangible book value per common share
See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 in the Financial Supplement. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income or return on equity determined in accordance with GAAP.

total $13.2 billion, are rated predominantly AA and comprise 25% of the fixed income portfolio. This compares to a 34% mortgage-backed weighting in representative indices of the U.S. fixed income market. The minimum rating for initial purchases of mortgage-backed securities is AA for agency mortgages and AAA for non-agency mortgages.
Mortgage-backed securities
with implied or explicit government guarantees total $11.1 billion and represent 93% of the residential mortgage-backed portfolio.
Securities issued by Federal agencies
are backed by prime collateral, and broadly diversified in over 129,000 loans. The portfolio's original loan-to-value ratio is approximately 68% with an average FICO score of 730. With this conservative loan-to-value ratio and subordinated collateral of 7%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 12% before principal is significantly impaired. The current foreclosure rate of ACE's non-agency RMBS portfolio is 9%.
Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
of $1.3 billion are rated predominantly AAA, broadly diversified with over 14,000 loans and seasoned with 60% of the portfolio issued before 2006 and 27% of the portfolio issued after 2009. The average loan-to-value ratio is approximately 65% with a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.7 and weighted average subordinated collateral of 33%. The cumulative foreclosure rate would have to rise to 43% before principal is impaired. The current foreclosure rate of the portfolio is about 2.7%.

Regulation GNon-GAAP Financial Measures
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per common share is provided on page 22.
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses). Life underwriting income includes net investment income and gains (losses) from separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP.
Loss and loss expense ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe losses and prior period development (PPD) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The loss ratio numerator includes Losses and loss expenses adjusted to exclude catastrophe losses and PPD. The loss ratio denominator includes Net premiums earned adjusted to exclude the amount of reinstatement premiums (expensed) collected. In periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from PPD and net earned premiums when calculating this ratio. We believe that excluding the impact of catastrophe losses and PPD provides a better evaluation of our core underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our property & casualty business that may be obscured by these items.
Annualized ROE calculated using income excluding net realized gains (losses) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ROE numerator includes income adjusted to exclude net realized gains (losses). The ROE denominator includes the average shareholders' equity for the period adjusted to exclude unrealized gains (losses) on investments and the deferred tax component included in shareholders' equity. To annualize a quarterly rate, multiply by four. Annualized ROE calculated using income excluding realized gains (losses) is a useful measure as it enhances the understanding of the return on shareholders' equity by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders' equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.
Income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related tax expense (benefit) is a common performance measurement for insurance companies and non-GAAP measure. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
