(b) Bruce L. Crockett and John A. Krol, members of the Board of Directors of ACE Limited (the "Company"), have determined to not stand for re-election to the Board at the Company's 2012 Annual General Meeting. Mr. Crockett has served the Company since 1995 and is a member of the Company's Risk and Finance Committee. Mr. Krol has been a director since 2001, is a member of the Nominating and Governance Committee and also Chairman of the Compensation Committee. In 2011, Mr. Krol reached the Board retirement age as contemplated by the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, but at the request of the disinterested members of the Board he graciously agreed to remain in his roles as director and Chairman of the Compensation Committee for a one-year term, which ends as of the Annual Meeting.
The decisions with respect to both directors were not the result of any disagreement with the Company. The Company is grateful for their service. Mr. Crockett and Mr. Krol will both remain on the Board and maintain their respective Committee memberships until the Annual Meeting, which is scheduled to occur in May 2012.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
