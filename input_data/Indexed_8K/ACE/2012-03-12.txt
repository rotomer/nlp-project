Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
ACE Limited (the "Company") amended Articles 3 and 5 of its Articles of Association effective March 8, 2012 to reflect share issuances out of conditional share capital since March 2011. The amended Articles accordingly indicate an increase in the number of registered common shares and a corresponding decrease in the number of shares of conditional share capital designated for employee benefits purposes. The Articles were otherwise unchanged. As a result, the Company now has 342,832,412 registered common shares, each with par value of CHF 30.27.
A copy of the amended and restated Articles of Association is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
