 ACE Limited (NYSE: ACE) today reported net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, of $0.96 per share, compared with $1.74 per share for the same quarter last year.
ZURICH  July 24, 2012
(1)
Income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $2.17 per share, compared with $1.97 per share for the same quarter last year.
(2)
Book value and tangible book value increased 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively, from March 31, 2012. Book value and tangible book value per share now stand at $75.98 and $61.75, respectively. Annualized operating return on equity for the quarter was 12.6%.
(2)
The property and casualty (P&C) combined ratio for the quarter was 88.7%.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net income was $3.80 per share, compared with $2.48 per share for 2011; income excluding net realized gains (losses) was $4.22 per share, compared with $2.74 per share for 2011. Book value increased $1.4 billion, up 5.9% from December 31, 2011, and tangible book value increased $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. The P&C combined ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2012, was 88.9%.
 
Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ACE Limited, commented: "ACE had a very strong second quarter, with excellent operating results that were ahead of plan despite a challenging and slowing global economy. After-tax operating income was $743 million, up 10% from last year, and our operating ROE was 12.6%. Our underwriting results this quarter were again distinguishing, with a P&C combined ratio of 88.7%. ACE's operating performance has been strong all year with earnings for the first six months exceeding $1.4 billion or $4.22 per share. Book value, which grew 1.3% in the quarter and is up almost 6% for the year, was impacted by the eurozone debt crisis and the consequent flight to safety, which affected foreign exchange, interest rates and equity markets.
"Total company net premiums written grew 4.5% in the quarter, or 6.5% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. As we said last quarter, our premium growth rate has been accelerating as the year progresses. We are benefiting from strong, broad-based growth, both geographic and product, along with an improving P&C price environment globally. For the first time, pricing in our international P&C operations in aggregate turned positive, whereas for our U.S. business, rates continued to rise, up 4.7% on average for the quarter.
"Drought conditions in the U.S. are impacting our crop insurance business and will affect our earnings in the second half of the year as described in our updated guidance. Crop insurance aside, we are optimistic about our revenue and earnings prospects for the balance of the year and we are well positioned to take advantage of the positive trend in P&C prices globally. At the same time, we are mindful of the economic and political headwinds  beginning with the eurozone crisis and the U.S. fiscal cliff, which are impacting economic conditions and business confidence in the U.S., China and the balance of the world  and the uncertainties these present."

The company is updating guidance for full-year 2012. The range is now $7.20 to $7.60 per share in after-tax operating income for the year. First, the update reflects the positive prior period reserve development and lower-than-planned catastrophe losses in the first half of $0.74 per share. Second, the update includes a reduction of $0.19 per share to reflect a projected third quarter increase in the year-to-date crop insurance loss ratio. Finally, the update includes estimated catastrophe losses of $270 million after tax for the second half of the year. Guidance for the balance of the year is for the current accident year only.

is a common performance measurement for insurance companies. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially-owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities.
Operating income or income excluding net realized gains (losses), net of tax
is calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting income and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other income (expense), interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). Life underwriting income includes net investment income and gains (losses) from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). P&C underwriting income and consolidated underwriting income are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business.
Underwriting income
is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ROE numerator includes income adjusted to exclude net realized gains (losses), net of tax. The ROE denominator includes the average shareholders' equity for the period adjusted to exclude unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. To annualize a quarterly rate, multiply by four. Annualized ROE calculated using income excluding realized gains (losses) is a useful measure as it enhances the understanding of the return on shareholders' equity by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders' equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.
Annualized operating return on equity (ROE) or annualized ROE calculated using income excluding net realized gains (losses)
is shareholders' equity divided by the shares outstanding.
Book value per common share
is shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets divided by the shares outstanding.
Tangible book value per common share
See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 21-22 in the Financial Supplement. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income, return on equity, or effective tax rate determined in accordance with GAAP.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncement:
Shareholders' equity and book value per common share at December 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011 and annualized ROE percentages for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of new guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The adoption of this guidance decreased shareholders' equity by $181 million as of December 31, 2011. The effect of the adoption of the new guidance on net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 was a decrease of $12 million and $22 million, respectively.

Mortgage-backed Fixed Income Portfolio
Mortgage-backed securities
 
total $12.7 billion, are rated predominantly AA and comprise 23% of the fixed income portfolio. This compares to a 32% mortgage-backed weighting in representative indices of the U.S. fixed income market. The minimum rating for initial purchases of mortgage-backed securities is AA for agency mortgages and AAA for non-agency mortgages.
Mortgage-backed securities
with implied or explicit government guarantees total $10.9 billion and represent 95% of the residential mortgage-backed portfolio.
Securities issued by Federal agencies
are backed by prime collateral, and broadly diversified in over 47,000 loans. The portfolio's original loan-to-value ratio is approximately 67% with an average FICO score of 730. With this conservative loan-to-value ratio and subordinated collateral of 5%, the cumulative 5-year foreclosure rate would have to rise to 15% before principal is significantly impaired. The foreclosure rate of ACE's non-agency RMBS portfolio at June 30, 2012 was 8%.
Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
of $1.2 billion are rated predominantly AAA, broadly diversified with over 13,000 loans and seasoned with 47% of the portfolio issued before 2006 and 38% of the portfolio issued after 2009. The average loan-to-value ratio is approximately 64% with a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.9 and weighted average subordinated collateral of 30%. The cumulative foreclosure rate would have to rise to 42% before principal is impaired. The foreclosure rate of ACE's commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolio at June 30, 2012 was about 2.3%.

Market Value at June 30, 2012
 
U.S. Below Investment Grade Corporate Fixed Income Portfolio
ACE manages high yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. ACE's allocation to high yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (BB/B). Our minimum rating for initial purchase is BB/B.
Six external investment managers are responsible for high yield security selection and portfolio construction.
ACE's high yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience.
Securities holdings are highly diversified across industries and are subject to a 1.5% issuer limit as a percentage of high yield allocation. The portfolio comprises over 750 issuers with our largest current issuer exposure at $95 million. ACE monitors position limits on a daily basis through an internal compliance system.
Derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps, CLOs) are not permitted in high yield portfolios.
 
 
Non-U.S. Fixed Income Portfolio
June 30, 2012
 
 
Non-U.S. Fixed Income Portfolio
ACE's non-U.S. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of ACE's non-U.S. operations.
78% of ACE's non-U.S. fixed income portfolios are denominated in G7 currencies.
Average credit quality of non-U.S. fixed income securities is very high at A and 54% of holdings are rated AAA or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies.
Corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. Issuer limits are based on credit rating (AA 2%, A 1%, BBB 0.5% of total portfolio) and are monitored on a daily basis by ACE via an internal compliance system.

Regulation G - Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In presenting our results, we have included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of book value per common share is provided on page 23.
In presenting our segment operating results, we have shown our performance with reference to underwriting results. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, policy benefits, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense, and net realized gains (losses). Life underwriting income includes net investment income and gains (losses) from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under GAAP.
Loss and loss expense ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe losses and prior period development (PPD) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The loss ratio numerator includes Losses and loss expenses adjusted to exclude catastrophe losses and PPD. The loss ratio denominator includes Net premiums earned adjusted to exclude the amount of reinstatement premiums (expensed) collected. In periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from PPD and net earned premiums when calculating this ratio. We believe that excluding the impact of catastrophe losses and PPD provides a better evaluation of our core underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our property & casualty business that may be obscured by these items.
Annualized ROE calculated using income excluding net realized gains (losses) is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ROE numerator includes income adjusted to exclude net realized gains (losses), net of tax. The ROE denominator includes the average shareholders' equity for the period adjusted to exclude unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. To annualize a quarterly rate, multiply by four. Annualized ROE calculated using income excluding realized gains (losses), net of tax, is a useful measure as it enhances the understanding of the return on shareholders' equity by highlighting the underlying profitability relative to shareholders' equity excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on our investments.
Income excluding net realized gains (losses), net of tax, is a common performance measurement for insurance companies and non-GAAP measure. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. We exclude net realized gains (losses) and net realized gains (losses) included in other income (expense) related to partially owned entities because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP.
