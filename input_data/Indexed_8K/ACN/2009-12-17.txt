Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK; Dec. 17, 2009  Accenture (NYSE: ACN) reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, ended Nov. 30, 2009, with net revenues of $5.38 billion, a decrease of 11 percent in U.S. dollars and 12 percent in local currency from the same period last year and within the company's guided range. Diluted earnings per share were $0.67.
Operating income was $746 million, and operating margin was 13.9 percent.
New bookings for the quarter were $5.53 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.51 billion and outsourcing bookings of $2.02 billion.
William D. Green, Accenture's chairman & CEO, said, "We continued to drive our business with discipline and a focus on execution, as well as with an eye to the future. We generated revenue within our expected range, delivered strong operating margin, ended the quarter with a cash balance of $4 billion after paying our annual dividend, and maintained our solid balance sheet.
"We are seeing building momentum in key areas of our business. Consulting bookings of $3.5 billion, growing pipelines and broadly heightened levels of activity are encouraging signs. We have mobilized to capture this opportunity. The demand for high performance from our clients is accelerating."
Financial Review
Revenues before reimbursements ("net revenues") for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were $5.38 billion, compared with $6.02 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, a decrease of 11 percent in U.S. dollars and 12 percent in local currency. Net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 reflect a foreign-exchange impact of positive 1 percent.
 
 
Diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.67, a decrease of $0.07 from the first quarter of fiscal 2009, broken down as:
 
    offset by:
 
Operating income for the first quarter was $746 million, or 13.9 percent of net revenues, compared with $815 million, or 13.5 percent of net revenues, for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) for the first quarter was 33.1 percent, compared with 31.4 percent for the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter were $1.03 billion, or 19.2 percent of net revenues, compared with $1.07 billion, or 17.8 percent of net revenues, for the first quarter last year. SG&A expenses in the first quarter last year included a $72 million provision for bad debt. The change in gross margin and in SG&A as a percentage of net revenues compared with the first quarter last year was primarily due to a change related to the recent implementation of the company's sales-effectiveness model. This reclassification had no overall impact on operating expense or operating margin.
The company's effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30.5 percent, compared with 26.6 percent for the first quarter last year, which was lower primarily as a result of final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities recorded in that quarter.
Net income before noncontrolling interests (previously "Income before minority interest") for the first quarter was $525 million, compared with $593 million for the same period of fiscal 2009, a decrease of 12 percent.
Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $219 million, and property and equipment additions were $35 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions, was $184 million. For the same period last year, operating cash flow was $468 million; property and equipment additions were $72 million; and free cash flow was $396 million. The reduction in free cash flow compared with the first quarter last year was driven primarily by an increase in days services outstanding from Aug. 31, 2009.
Days services outstanding, or DSOs, were 32 at Nov. 30, 2009, compared with 28 at Aug. 31, 2009, and 36 at Nov. 30, 2008.
Accenture's total cash balance at Nov. 30, 2009 was $4.00 billion, compared with $4.54 billion at Aug. 31, 2009. The company paid a cash dividend to shareholders in November totaling more than $550 million.
Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was 88 percent, compared with 83 percent for the first quarter last year. Attrition for the quarter was 12 percent, compared with 13 percent for the same period last year.
 
New Bookings
New bookings for the first quarter were $5.53 billion. This reflects a positive 3 percent foreign-currency impact when compared to new bookings in the first quarter last year.
 
 
Net Revenues by Operating Group
Accenture's business continues to be affected by global economic conditions, with all operating groups except Health & Public Service experiencing local-currency revenue declines during the first quarter. Accenture's strong results in the first quarter last fiscal year  which included local-currency revenue growth of 9 percent  were achieved prior to the company feeling the effects, beginning in January, of the global economic downturn.
Net revenues by operating group for the first quarter were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
*On Sept. 1, 2009, the Company formed the Health & Public Service operating group by combining various healthcare-related components of its Products operating group with its Public Service operating group. Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-period presentation.

Share Repurchase Activity

At Nov. 30, 2009, Accenture had approximately 730 million total shares outstanding, including 632 million Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and 98 million Accenture SCA Class I common shares and Accenture Canada Holding, Inc. exchangeable shares.
Dividend
On Nov. 16, 2009, a cash dividend of $0.75 per share was paid on Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares to shareholders of record at the close of business on Oct. 16, 2009. On Nov. 16, 2009, a cash dividend of $0.75 per share was also paid on Accenture SCA Class I common shares to shareholders of record at the close of business on Oct. 13, 2009.

Business Outlook
Second Quarter Fiscal 2010
Accenture expects net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. This range assumes a foreign-exchange impact of positive 7 percent compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
Full Fiscal Year 2010

For the full fiscal year 2010, Accenture continues to expect net revenue growth to be in the range of negative 3 percent to positive 1 percent in local currency.

Accenture continues to expect operating margin for the full fiscal year to be 13.4 percent.
The company continues to expect operating cash flow to be $2.39 billion to $2.59 billion; property and equipment additions to be $290 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
