Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)           On February 4, 2010, Accenture plc ("Accenture") held its 2010 annual general meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting"). At the Annual Meeting, Accenture's shareholders approved the Accenture plc 2010 Share Incentive Plan (the "2010 SIP") and the Accenture plc 2010 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the "2010 ESPP"), both of which the Board of Directors of Accenture approved on December 10, 2009, subject to the approval of Accenture's shareholders.
The 2010 SIP is similar to the current Accenture 2001 Share Incentive Plan (the "2001 SIP"), but with updates to plan provisions generally intended to reflect changes in tax and accounting rules. No new grants will be made under the 2001 SIP.
The 2010 ESPP is similar to the current Accenture 2001 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the "2001 ESPP"), but with updates to plan provisions generally intended to reflect changes in tax and accounting rules and to update the terms under which shares may be offered for purchase under the plan. The share issuance in May 2010 for the current offering period will be satisfied under the 2001 ESPP. No new purchase offers will be made under the 2001 ESPP and no new shares will be issued under the 2001 ESPP following the May 2010 issuance
.
The material features of each of the plans are described in Accenture's definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting filed on December 21, 2009 (the "Proxy Statement"), and the descriptions of each of the plans are incorporated herein by reference. The above descriptions of the 2010 SIP and the 2010 ESPP are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of such documents found as annexes to the Proxy Statement.
