Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK; June 24, 2010  Accenture (NYSE: ACN) reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, ended May 31, 2010, with net revenues of $5.57 billion, an increase of 8 percent in U.S. dollars and 4 percent in local currency over the same period last year and within the company's guided range. Diluted earnings per share were $0.73, an increase of $0.05 over the same period last year.
Operating income was $804 million, an increase of 10 percent over the same period last year, and operating margin increased 20 basis points, to 14.4 percent.
New bookings for the quarter were $6.43 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.18 billion and outsourcing bookings of $3.25 billion, bringing total year-to-date new bookings to $18.5 billion.
William D. Green, Accenture's chairman & CEO, said, "We are delighted with our revenue growth, our momentum and our results in the third quarter, with growth led by strong performances from our Products and Financial Services operating groups. The disciplined management of our business also enabled us to grow operating margin and EPS and continue generating significant free cash flow.
"While recovery in the economic environment remains uneven, we continue to see increasing demand for our services, demonstrated by bookings of more than $6.4 billion in the quarter. We're particularly pleased that year-to-date bookings in Financial Services are at a record level. We are also starting to see the positive impact of our growth strategy, with solid performance in our core business and momentum in many new business areas as well as new markets. As always, we remain focused on delivering increasing value to our clients and our shareholders."
Financial Review
Revenues before reimbursements ("net revenues") for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were $5.57 billion, compared with $5.15 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 8 percent in U.S. dollars and 4 percent in local currency. Net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were within the company's guided range and reflect a foreign-exchange impact that rounds to positive 5 percent.
 
Diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were $0.73, an increase of $0.05 over the third quarter of fiscal 2009, broken down as:
 
offset by:
 
Operating income for the third quarter was $804 million, or 14.4 percent of net revenues, compared with $732 million, or 14.2 percent of net revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) for the third quarter was 34.7 percent, compared with 32.5 percent for the third quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the third quarter were $1.12 billion, or 20.2 percent of net revenues, compared with $935 million, or 18.2 percent of net revenues, for the third quarter last year. The change in gross margin and in SG&A as a percentage of net revenues compared with the third quarter last year was primarily due to the implementation of the company's sales-effectiveness model, which the company described after its first quarter this year. This had no overall impact on reported operating expenses or operating margin.
The company's effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.8 percent, compared with 28.2 percent for the third quarter last year. The lower tax rate in the third quarter last year was primarily a result of higher benefits related to final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities recorded in that quarter.
Net income (previously "Net income before noncontrolling interests" and "Income before minority interest") for the third quarter was $564 million, compared with $537 million for the same period of fiscal 2009.
Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $961 million, and property and equipment additions were $58 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions, was $903 million. For the same period last year, operating cash flow was $1,015 million; property and equipment additions were $44 million; and free cash flow was $971 million.
Days services outstanding, or DSOs, were 28 at May 31, 2010, flat compared with Aug. 31, 2009.
Accenture's total cash balance at May 31, 2010 was $4.31 billion, compared with $4.54 billion at Aug. 31, 2009.
Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was 88 percent, compared with 88 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and 83 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Attrition for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was 17 percent, compared with 15 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and 8 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
New Bookings

Business Outlook
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2010
