NEW YORK; Sept. 30, 2010  Accenture (NYSE: ACN) reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, ended Aug. 31, and full-year results in line with the company's expectations.
For the fourth quarter, revenues before reimbursements ("net revenues") were $5.42 billion, an increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars and 8 percent in local currency compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $0.66. New bookings were $6.5 billion. Operating margin was 13.2 percent. Free cash flow was $1.15 billion.
For the full fiscal year, net revenues were $21.55 billion, flat in U.S. dollars and a decrease of 2 percent in local currency compared with fiscal 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $2.66. New bookings were $25.0 billion. Operating margin was 13.5 percent. Free cash flow was $2.85 billion, which exceeded the top end of the company's expectations by $350 million.
In addition, Accenture's Board of Directors has declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.45 per share, an increase of 7.5 cents per share, or 20 percent, over its previous semi-annual dividend, declared in March.
William D. Green, Accenture's chairman & CEO, said, "We're very pleased with our financial results, with our strong fourth-quarter performance demonstrating further evidence of our growth and momentum. We managed our business well and accelerated actions to grow revenue and expand operating margin. And our strong bookings  including consulting bookings of more than $3.5 billion  show increasing demand for our services. We generated significant free cash flow, and our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong. We continued our commitment to return cash to shareholders through an increased semi-annual cash dividend, declared today, and through the repurchase of more than $2 billion of our shares during fiscal 2010.
"We are working at the heart of our clients' businesses, helping them navigate the changing global environment and improve their performance. We will continue to invest in our core business, as well as in new growth areas and markets, to deliver increasing value to both our clients and shareholders. Despite ongoing challenges in the global economy, we are well-positioned for growth and expansion in the year ahead."
Financial Review
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2010
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $5.42 billion, compared with $5.15 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, an increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars and 8 percent in local currency. Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 reflect a foreign-exchange impact of negative 3 percent compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, less than the negative 5 percent impact the Company had previously assumed. Adjusting for the actual foreign exchange impact in the fourth quarter, the Company's previously expected range for quarterly net revenues would have been $5.25 billion to $5.45 billion. Therefore, Accenture's fourth-quarter fiscal 2010 net revenues of $5.42 billion were at the high end of the previously expected range.
 
 
Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter were $0.66, compared with $0.39 for the fourth quarter last year. The increase in EPS is broken down as:
 
 
 
Offset by:
 
 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was $714 million, or 13.2 percent of net revenues. This compares with fourth-quarter fiscal 2009 operating income of $420 million, or 8.2 percent of net revenues, on a GAAP basis and $672 million, or 13.1 percent of net revenues, excluding the impact of the $253 million restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) for the fourth quarter was 34.0 percent, compared with 32.3 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter were $1.13 billion, or 20.9 percent of net revenues, compared with $985 million, or 19.1 percent of net revenues, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The change in gross margin and in SG&A as a percentage of net revenues compared with the fourth quarter last year was primarily due to the implementation of the company's sales-effectiveness model, which the company described after the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This had no overall impact on reported operating expenses or operating margin.
 
The company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.8 percent, compared with 27.6 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Net income (previously "Income before minority interest") for the fourth quarter was $510 million, compared with $306 million for the same period of fiscal 2009, which included the impact of the restructuring charge in that quarter.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $1.25 billion, and property and equipment additions were $102 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions, was $1.15 billion, an increase of $179 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. For the same period of fiscal 2009, operating cash flow was $1.05 billion, property and equipment additions were $75 million, and free cash flow was $971 million.
Days services outstanding, or DSOs, were 30 days at Aug. 31, 2010, compared with 28 days at Aug. 31, 2009.
Accenture's total cash balance at Aug. 31, 2010 was $4.84 billion, compared with $4.54 billion at Aug. 31, 2009.
Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was 86 percent, compared with 88 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and 86 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Attrition for the fourth quarter was 17 percent, compared with 17 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and 10 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the full fiscal year were $4.33 billion, or 20.1 percent of net revenues, compared with $3.95 billion, or 18.3 percent of net revenues, for fiscal 2009. The change in gross margin and in SG&A as a percentage of net revenues compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the implementation of the company's sales-effectiveness model, which the company described after the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This had no overall impact on reported operating expenses or operating margin.
Accenture's annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year was 29.3 percent, compared with 27.6 percent for fiscal 2009, in line with the company's guided range of 29 percent to 30 percent.
