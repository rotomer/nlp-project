Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK; March 24, 2011  Accenture (NYSE: ACN) reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, ended Feb. 28, 2011, with net revenues of $6.05 billion, an increase of 17 percent in U.S. dollars and 18 percent in local currency over the same period last year and exceeding the company's guided range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $0.75, an increase of $0.15, or 25 percent, over the same period last year.
Operating income was $772 million, an increase of 19 percent over the same period last year, and operating margin was 12.7 percent.
New bookings for the quarter were $6.98 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.80 billion and outsourcing bookings of $3.18 billion.
In addition, Accenture's Board of Directors has declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.45 per share, to be paid on May 13, 2011.
Pierre Nanterme, Accenture's chief executive officer, said, "We are very pleased with the continued momentum in our business, which enabled us to achieve strong results in the second quarter. We saw very strong revenue growth in both U.S. dollars and local currency across our operating groups and geographic regions. We also achieved significant EPS growth of 25 percent, and we continue to maintain an exceptionally strong balance sheet.
"With quarterly bookings of $7 billion, including our second-highest consulting bookings ever, demand for our services remains strong, and our growth trajectory demonstrates that we continue to execute our business strategy extremely well. We remain focused on growing market share and, as always, on delivering value to our clients as well as our shareholders."
Financial Review
Revenues before reimbursements ("net revenues") for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 were $6.05 billion, compared with $5.18 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 17 percent in U.S. dollars and 18 percent in local currency. Net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 exceeded the company's guided range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, which assumed a foreign-exchange impact of negative 2 percent. Adjusting for the actual foreign-exchange impact of negative 1 percent in the second quarter, the Company's guided range for
quarterly net revenues would have been $5.65 billion to $5.85 billion. Net revenues of $6.05 billion for the quarter also exceeded this adjusted range.
 
 
Diluted EPS for the quarter were $0.75, an increase of $0.15, or 25 percent, compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The components of the increase were:
 
offset by:
 
Operating income for the quarter was $772 million, or 12.7 percent of net revenues, compared with $651 million, or 12.6 percent of net revenues, for the second quarter of fiscal 2010, an expansion of 10 basis points over the second quarter last year.
Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net revenues) for the quarter was 31.7 percent, compared with 32.7 percent for the second quarter last year. The change in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues compared with the second quarter last year reflects the impact of the return of strong growth in the business, which resulted in higher annual compensation increases, higher subcontractor costs, and higher recruiting and training costs from the addition of a larger number of new employees to meet demand.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter were $1.15 billion, or 18.9 percent of net revenues, compared with $1.04 billion, or 20.0 percent of net revenues, for the second quarter last year.
The company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.9 percent, compared with 27.8 percent for the second quarter last year. The lower rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was due to a number of factors that affect the geographic distribution of income.
Net income for the quarter was $566 million, compared with $462 million for the same period of fiscal 2010, an increase of 22 percent.
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $601 million, and property and equipment additions were $79 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions, rounded to $523 million. For the same period last year, operating cash flow was $660 million; property and equipment additions were $44 million; and free cash flow was $616 million.
Days services outstanding, or DSOs, were 32 days at Feb. 28, 2011, compared with 30 days at Aug. 31, 2010.
Accenture's total cash balance at Feb. 28, 2011 was $4.68 billion, compared with $4.84 billion at Aug. 31, 2010.
Utilization for the quarter was 86 percent, compared with 88 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Attrition for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was 14 percent, compared with 15 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
New Bookings
New bookings for the second quarter were $6.98 billion and reflect a negative 1 percent foreign-currency impact compared with new bookings in the second quarter last year.
