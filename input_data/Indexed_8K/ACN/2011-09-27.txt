Diluted earnings per share were $0.91, an increase of 38 percent. Operating margin was 13.8 percent. Operating cash flow was $1.4 billion and free cash flow was $1.2 billion, both quarterly records. New bookings were $8.4 billion, the company's highest quarterly bookings ever.
For the full fiscal year, net revenues were $25.5 billion, an increase of 18 percent in U.S. dollars and 15 percent in local currency compared with fiscal 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $3.40, an increase of 28 percent. Operating margin was 13.6 percent. Operating cash flow was $3.4 billion and free cash flow was $3.0 billion, which exceeded the top end of the company's expectations by more than $300 million. New bookings were $28.8 billion.

Pierre Nanterme, Accenture's chief executive officer, said, "Our excellent results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2011 reflect the continued momentum in our business as we execute our growth strategy. We hit the top end of our range for both revenues and EPS and are particularly pleased with the growth across all dimensions of our business. In addition, we generated free cash flow of $3 billion for the year, which enabled us to return more than $2.8 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and still close the year with an exceptionally strong balance sheet.
"While we are closely monitoring the economic environment, we continue to see strong demand for our services  demonstrated by record bookings of $8 billion in the fourth quarter and $29 billion in the full year. We are investing in our core business, in strategic initiatives and in our key geographic growth markets. Our industry expertise and technology leadership remain key differentiators for us, and we continue to run our business with rigor and discipline  with a focus on driving profitable growth, increasing market share and delivering significant value to clients and shareholders."
Financial Review
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2011
Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $6.7 billion, compared with $5.4 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 23 percent in U.S. dollars and 14 percent in local currency. Net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 exceeded the company's guided range of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, which assumed a foreign-exchange impact of positive 8 percent. Adjusting for the actual foreign-exchange impact of positive 9 percent in the fourth quarter, the company's guided range for quarterly net revenues would have been $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion. Net revenues of $6.7 billion for the quarter were just above this adjusted range.
 
 
Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter were $0.91, compared with $0.66 for the fourth quarter last year. The $0.25 increase in EPS reflects:
 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was $923 million, or 13.8 percent of net revenues, compared with $714 million, or 13.2 percent of net revenues, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an expansion of 60 basis points.

The company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27.0 percent, compared with 28.8 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The lower rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a number of factors that affect the geographic mix of income.
Net income for the fourth quarter was $683 million, compared with $510 million for the same period of fiscal 2010.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $1.38 billion, and property and equipment additions were $137 million.
