Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On February 9, 2012, at the annual general meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Accenture plc (the "Company"), the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's articles of association that provides for a phased-in declassification of the Board of Directors and the annual election of all directors who are re-appointed beginning at the Company's 2013 annual general meeting of shareholders.
Because the amendment does not shorten the existing terms of the directors, the directors who have been elected to three-year terms prior to the effectiveness of the amendment, including directors elected at the Annual Meeting, will complete those three-year terms. Effective February 9, 2012, pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, (1) the Class III directors standing for appointment at the Company's 2013 annual general meeting of shareholders will stand for appointment for a one-year term and (2) the Class I directors standing for appointment at the Company's 2014 annual general meeting of shareholders will stand for appointment for a one-year term, along with the Class III directors. Beginning with the Company's 2015 annual general meeting of shareholders, and at each annual general meeting of shareholders thereafter, the Company's entire Board of Directors will stand for appointment for a one-year term and there will no longer be any designation by classes.
The above summary of the amendments to the articles of association of Accenture plc is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 3.1.
