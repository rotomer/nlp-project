Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK; March 22, 2012  Accenture (NYSE: ACN) reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, ended Feb. 29, 2012, with net revenues of $6.8 billion, an increase of 12 percent in U.S. dollars and 13 percent in local currency over the same period last year and at the top end of the company's guided range. Diluted earnings per share were $0.97, an increase of $0.22 over the same period last year, driven principally by higher revenue and operating income, as well as a lower effective tax rate in the quarter.
Operating income was $889 million, an increase of 15 percent over the same period last year, and operating margin was 13.1 percent.
New bookings for the quarter were $7.94 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.05 billion and outsourcing bookings of $3.89 billion.
Pierre Nanterme, Accenture's chief executive officer, said, "We are very pleased with our second-quarter performance, which included strong revenue growth in all five operating groups and all three geographic regions. We're also pleased with our profitability  both the growth in EPS and the expansion of operating margin  due to the disciplined management of our business. We continued to see solid demand for our services, as demonstrated by outstanding bookings of nearly $8 billion, and our balance sheet remains very strong.
"Given our strong results for the first half of fiscal 2012, we've raised our outlook for revenue growth and EPS for the year. We continue to invest to further differentiate our industry and technology capabilities and remain focused on gaining market share and driving profitable growth."
Financial Review
Revenues before reimbursements ("net revenues") for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $6.8 billion, compared with $6.1 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2011, an increase of 12 percent in U.S. dollars and 13 percent in local currency.

The company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5 percent, compared with 26.9 percent for the second quarter last year.

Forward-Looking Statements
Except for the historical information and discussions contained herein, statements in this news release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These include, without limitation, risks that: the company's results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on the company's clients' businesses and levels of business activity; the company's business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for the company's services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect the company's results of operations; if the company is unable to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, the company's business, the utilization rate of the company's professionals and the company's results of operations may be materially adversely affected; the consulting and outsourcing markets are highly competitive, and the company might not be able to compete effectively; the company's results of operations (including its net revenues and operating income) and the value of balance-sheet items originally denominated in other currencies could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or changes to existing currencies; the company could have liability or the company's reputation could be damaged if the company fails to protect client and company data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if the company's information systems are breached; the company's Global Delivery Network is increasingly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose it to operational risks; as a result of the company's geographically diverse operations and its growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, the company is more susceptible to certain risks; the company's results of operations could materially suffer if the company is not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable it to meet its profitability expectations; if the company's pricing estimates do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of the company performing its work or third parties upon which it relies do not meet their commitments, then the company's contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be unprofitable; the company's work with government clients exposes the company to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment, including risks related to governmental budget and debt constraints; the company's business could be materially adversely affected if it incurs legal liability in connection with providing its services and solutions; the company's results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if the company cannot adapt and expand its services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants; outsourcing services subject the company to different operational risks than its consulting and systems integration services; the company's services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or the company might lose its ability to utilize the intellectual property of others; the company has only a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, which are important to the company's success; the company's ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on its reputation in the marketplace; the company's alliance relationships may not be successful or may change, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations; the company may not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating other businesses; the company's profitability could suffer if its cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and the company may not be able to improve its profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree it has done in the past; many of the company's contracts include performance payments that link some of its fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require the company to meet specific service levels, which could increase the variability of the company's revenues and impact its margins; changes in the company's level of taxes, and audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in the company's treatment as an Irish company, could have a
material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition; if the company is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with its size, the company might be unable to achieve its business objectives; if the company is unable to collect its receivables or unbilled services, the company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected; the company's share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict; the company's results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective internal controls; the company may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to its incorporation in Ireland; as well as the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed under the "Risk Factors" heading in Accenture plc's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
