On a year-over-year basis, this represents 27 percent revenue growth.  Adobe's third quarter revenue target range, revised upward on August 2, 2004, was $380 to $400 million.
 
"We continue to perform exceptionally well against our strategy to deliver comprehensive platform solutions to our customers," said Bruce R. Chizen, president and chief executive officer. "Our business momentum continues in advance of major new product releases beginning in Q1."
 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $0.42.   Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which does not include an investment loss from the company's venture program, were $0.43.  Adobe's revised GAAP and non-GAAP third quarter earnings target range was $0.36 to $0.41 per share.
 
GAAP net income was $104.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $64.5 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, and $109.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.  On a year-over-year basis, GAAP net income grew 62 percent.

On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP net income grew 59 percent.
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $0.42 based on 247.1 million weighted average shares. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.27 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, based on 240.5 million weighted average shares, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44 reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, based on 247.0 million weighted average shares.

Company Provides Fourth Quarter Financial Targets
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company announced that it is targeting revenue of $400 to $415 million, a gross margin range of approximately 94 percent, and GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin ranges of 31 to 33 percent.

The Company also is targeting other income in its fourth quarter to be approximately $3 million, and a tax rate of 26 percent.  These targets lead to fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share target ranges of $0.38 to $0.41.
 
The Company currently believes targeted non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP operating margin results will not differ materially from targeted GAAP results.

Non-GAAP Results

The following table shows the Company's non-GAAP results reconciled to GAAP results included in this release. The Company's non-GAAP results do not, as applicable, include restructuring and other charges or investment gains and losses.
 
 
Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures.  Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Adobe presents
such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations.  Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review both GAAP information that includes charges and investment gains and losses discussed below and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such charges and investment gains and losses in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.
 
Adobe's non-GAAP operating income excludes, as applicable, restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude, as applicable, restructuring and other charges and investment gains and losses. Management believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results and has historically provided comparability to similar companies in Adobe's industry, many of which present the same or similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Whenever Adobe uses such a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.
 
Adobe excludes restructuring and other charges, including (i) employee severance and other termination benefits, (ii) lease termination costs and other expenses associated with exiting facilities, and (iii) other costs associated with terminating contracts, from its non-GAAP financial measure of operating income and net income. Adobe's management does not consider these restructuring costs as a normal component of its expenses related to ongoing operations as such charges have occurred only periodically and have not been directly linked to the level of Adobe's business activities in the quarter in which such charges occur. As a result, Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review both GAAP information that includes such charges and non-GAAP measures of operating income and net income that exclude these charges to have a better understanding of the overall performance of Adobe's ongoing business operations and its performance in the periods presented.
 
In accordance with GAAP, Adobe records investment gains and losses from its venture program.  These charges are otherwise unrelated to Adobe's ongoing business operations and are excluded from its non-GAAP financial information.
