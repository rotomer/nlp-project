Mr. Elop will also be granted an option to purchase 175,000 shares of Adobe common stock. Under the Employment Agreement, Adobe will reimburse Mr. Elop for his reasonable expenses in traveling between his office at corporate headquarters and his residence in Canada.
 
The Employment Agreement also confirms that upon the closing of the Merger, pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Macromedia compensation committee on February 26, 1997 and April 8, 2005, stock options awarded to Mr. Elop by Macromedia before January 19, 2005 will have vesting accelerated by an 18-month period.

Effective December 3, 2005, Adobe's board of directors adopted the Adobe Systems Incorporated 2005 Equity Incentive Assumption Plan (the ""). The Assumption Plan permits the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights, stock bonuses, performance shares, and performance units.  The terms and conditions of such stock awards under the Assumption Plan are substantially similar to those under Adobe's 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, which was last approved by Adobe's stockholders on April 28, 2005.  In accordance with NASDAQ listing requirements, Adobe may grant new stock awards under the Assumption Plan to its employees who were not employed by or providing services to Adobe or any of its affiliates (other than Macromedia and its affiliates and subsidiaries) prior to December 3, 2005.
Assumption Plan
 
Under the Assumption Plan, an aggregate of 8,838,874 shares of Adobe common stock is reserved for issuance.  Such share reserve consists solely of the unused and converted share reserves and potential reversions to the share reserves as of December 3, 2005, with respect to the Macromedia Plans.  The share reserve is divided into Reserve A and Reserve B.   Reserve A consists of 190,678 shares of Adobe common stock which includes the unused share reserve of and potential reversions to the Andromedia, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan.  Reserve B consists of 8,648,196 shares of Adobe common stock which includes the unused share reserve of and potential reversions to the (i) Macromedia, Inc. 2002 Equity Incentive Plan, (ii) Allaire Corp. 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, (iii) Allaire Corporation 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, and (iv) Allaire Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.  In the event of the forfeiture or expiration of any stock awards granted under the Macromedia Plans, the shares of Adobe common stock associated with such forfeited or expired stock awards will become available for award pursuant to the terms of Reserve A or Reserve B, as applicable.  No stock awards may be made from Reserve A after August 1, 2009, and no stock awards may be made from Reserve B after November 10, 2014.  The Assumption Plan limits the number of shares that may be issued in the form of stock purchase rights, stock bonuses, performance shares, or performance units to 100,000 shares of Adobe common stock.
 
In the event of a sale of substantially all of the voting stock of Adobe, a merger involving Adobe, the sale of substantially all of the assets of Adobe, or a liquidation or dissolution of Adobe, stock awards may be assumed or substituted by a successor entity.  In the event that a successor entity elects not to assume or substitute for such stock awards, the stock awards will become fully vested.
 
The board of directors of Adobe may terminate or amend the Assumption Plan at any time subject to applicable rules. The summary of the Assumption Plan contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Assumption Plan, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference, and the form of Nonstatutory Stock Option Agreement for use in grants under the Assumption Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3.

Included in the restructuring and other charges are (i) approximately $4.0 to $5.0 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and accelerated depreciation of tenant improvements and (ii) approximately $16.0 to $20.0 million related to employee severance arrangements. Adobe expects to complete the majority of the activities related to the Restructuring Plan in its first quarter ending March 3, 2006.
Restructuring Plan
 
These restructuring expenses relate only to those employees and facilities that were associated with Adobe prior to the acquisition of Macromedia on December 3, 2005. These expenses will be a charge to earnings in the respective quarter in which they are incurred. Adobe expects to incur additional restructuring expenses relating to Macromedia's operations. These costs will be included in the assumed liabilities of Macromedia as of December 3, 2005 and will be recorded as part of the total acquisition purchase price of Macromedia.

 The Plan shall have two separate share reserves ("Reserve A" and "Reserve B") reflecting the unused share reserves and potential reversions to such reserves, as of the Effective Date, with respect to the following equity incentive plans that were maintained by Macromedia, Inc. prior to the Effective Date:

Reserve B:
                                      
 
Accordingly, as of the Effective Date, Reserve A consists of 190,678 shares of Stock, of which there are Outstanding Awards covering 186,279 shares of Stock and 4,399 shares of Stock remaining available for Awards; and Reserve B consists of 8,648,196 shares of Stock, of which there are Outstanding Awards covering 8,382,090 shares of Stock and 266,106 shares of Stock remaining available for Awards.  Outstanding Awards shall continue to be governed by and administered under the terms of the Macromedia Plans pursuant to which they originally were granted, but in the event of their forfeiture or expiration unexercised, the shares of Stock associated with such forfeited or expired Outstanding Awards shall become available for award pursuant to the terms of this Plan from Reserve A or Reserve B, as applicable.  Reserve A and Reserve B shall both be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2 of the Plan.  Such shares shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof.  If an Award for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company at the Participant's purchase price to effect a forfeiture of unvested shares upon termination of Service, the shares of Stock allocable to the terminated portion of such Award or such forfeited or repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan from Reserve A or Reserve B, as applicable.  Shares of Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the Plan with respect to any portion of an Award (other than an SAR that may be settled in shares of Stock or cash) that is settled in cash.  Shares withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 13.2 shall not again become available for issuance under the Plan.  Upon payment in shares of Stock pursuant to the exercise of an SAR, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the SAR is exercised.  If the exercise price of an Option is paid by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Participant, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the Option is exercised.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the exercise or purchase price under any Award be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to such Award.  The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be final, binding and conclusive.

aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Section 4.2), (b) no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Awards, and (c)  no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company's stockholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan may be increased without stockholder approval in accordance with Rule 4350(i)(1)(A)(iii) of the Nasdaq Qualitative Listing Requirements (or any other applicable rule of the securities exchange on which shares of Stock are then trading) in connection with business acquisitions by the Company following the Effective Date.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
.
 
  Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted.  The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.  Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.

Provision of Information.
 
  No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, shall have a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant.  Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall confer on any Participant a right to remain an Employee, or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the Participant's Service at any time.  To the extent that an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that Award can in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the Company is the Employee's employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship with the Company.
15.3
                          
Rights as Employee.
 
  A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4.2 or another provision of the Plan.
15.4
                          
Rights as a Stockholder.

  Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit.  Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime.  If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse.  If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal representative.
15.6
                          
Beneficiary Designation.
 
  Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company.  Any amounts payable to Participants pursuant to the Plan shall be unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  No Participating Company shall be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations.  The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder.  Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of any Participating Company.  The Participants shall have no claim against any Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.

Cashless Exercise
 
  Regardless of any action taken by the Participating Company Group with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Participating Company Group (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of shares acquired pursuant to such exercise, or the receipt of any dividends and (ii) does not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any other aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.  At the time of exercise of the Option, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Participating Company Group to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group.  In this regard, at the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for withholding of all applicable Tax Related Items by the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option.  Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under applicable law, the Participating Company Group may (i) sell or arrange for the sale of shares acquired by the Participant to meet the withholding obligation of Tax-Related

The Company shall have no obligation to process the exercise of the Option or to deliver shares of Stock until the obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section have been satisfied by the Participant.
 
  The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice any or all shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Option.  Except as provided by the preceding sentence, a certificate for the shares as to which the Option is exercised shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Participant.

Beneficial Ownership of Shares; Certificate Registration

  The grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities.  The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  THE PARTICIPANT IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED.  ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTICIPANT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

6.1

the future value of the underlying shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;
6.7
                                
 
if the underlying shares do not increase in value, the Option will have no value;
6.8
                                
 
if the Participant exercises the Option and obtains shares, the value of those shares acquired upon exercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Option price; and
6.9
                                
 
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages arises from termination of the Option or diminution in value of the Option or shares purchased through exercise of the Option resulting from termination of the Participant's Service with the Participating Company Group (for any reason whether or not in breach of applicable labor laws) and the Participant irrevocably releases the Participating Company Group from any such claim that may arise.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen then, by signing this Option Agreement, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived your entitlement to pursue such a claim.

Executive acknowledges that he has read section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, which states in full:
5.
              
 
A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in
his or her
favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by
him or her
must have materially affected
his or her
settlement with the debtor.
 
Executive waives any rights that he has or may have under section 1542 or any similar provision of the laws of any other jurisdiction to the full extent that he may lawfully waive such rights pertaining to this general release of claims, and affirms that he is releasing all known and unknown claims that he has or may have against the parties listed above.
 
6.     In the event that Executive does not provide any work, services, or assistance (as an employee, director, contractor, consultant, investor, or otherwise) to any competitor of the Company (except with the prior written consent of the Company) during the period between the date of this Agreement and November 30, 2006, the Company shall make a payment to Executive of $175,000, less applicable withholding.  Such payment, if earned, shall be made on or before December 15, 2006, and shall also be conditioned upon Executive's execution and return of a general release of known and unknown claims against the Company and its affiliated persons and entities in a form satisfactory to the Company.
 
For purposes of this paragraph, (a) the determination of whether an entity constitutes a competitor of the Company shall be made by the Company in its sole discretion, and (b) Executive's ownership of up to two percent (2%) of the stock of any publicly-traded company shall not be deemed to be the provision of work, services, or assistance to a competitor of the Company.
 
The parties acknowledge and agree that this paragraph 6 does not preclude Executive from accepting employment with, or otherwise working for or providing services to, a competitor of the Company.  Executive may elect to accept employment with, or provide work, services, or assistance to, any competitor of the Company, without incurring any liability to the Company; provided, however, that such
action by Executive shall excuse the Company's performance of the payment obligation described in this paragraph 6.
 
7.     Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall continue to be bound by and comply with the terms of the Employee Inventions and Proprietary Rights Assignment Agreement that Executive signed in connection with his employment by the Company, which agreement is incorporated herein by reference.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the Company's confidential information, there will be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of Executive's obligations.  Executive further acknowledges that any such breach will result in irreparable harm to the Company and, therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to immediate equitable relief, including but not limited to injunction, in addition to whatever remedies the Company may have at law.
 
he shall not directly or indirectly disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone other than his immediate family or counsel, except as such disclosure may be required for accounting or tax reporting purposes or as otherwise may be required by law, unless the Company has previously publicly disclosed such terms.
8.     Executive agrees that
 
he will not, at any time in the future, make any disparaging statements about the Company, its products or its employees, unless such statements are made truthfully in response to a subpoena or other legal process.  Employee further agrees that for a period of twenty-four months following the Termination Date, he shall not, either directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage any employee of the Company or any affiliate of the Company to terminate his or her employment with the Company or its affiliate.
9.     Executive further agrees that
 
10.   Executive agrees that in the event of his breach of any of the provisions of paragraphs 9 or 12, it will be impractical and extremely difficult to determine the actual damages suffered by the Company as a result of that breach. Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any provision of paragraphs 9 or 12, he shall repay the Company 30% of the net sum (that is, after deducting all taxes and other withholdings) that he receives pursuant to paragraph 3(a) as liquidated damages.
 
11.   The Company agrees that it will not, through any of its officers or directors, at any time in the future, make any disparaging statements about Executive, unless such statements are made truthfully in response to a subpoena or other legal process.
 
12.   Following the Termination Date, Executive agrees to provide reasonable assistance to the Company in connection with any litigation to which the Company is or may become a party and with respect to which Executive possesses any relevant knowledge or expertise.
Executive's assistance will be provided at mutually convenient times, and the Company will reimburse Executive for any reasonable expenses incurred by him in providing such assistance.
 
13.   In the event of any legal action relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that action.
 
14.   In response to inquiries from prospective employers regarding Executive, the Company's Human Resources Department will provide no information other than Executive's dates of employment and positions held with the Company.
 
15.   This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements, whether written or oral.  This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a document signed by an authorized officer of the Company and Executive.
