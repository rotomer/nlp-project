SAN JOSE, Calif.  December 15, 2005
 Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today reported strong financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 2, 2005.
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, Adobe achieved record revenue of $510.4 million, compared to $429.5 million reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and $487.0 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.  On a year-over-year basis, this represents 19 percent revenue growth.  Adobe's fourth quarter revenue target range was $490 to $510 million.
 
"2005 was another remarkable year for Adobe," said Bruce R. Chizen, Adobe chief executive officer. "We grew our business 18 percent, generated record profits, and for the third consecutive year, achieved record revenue for the fourth quarter and year. At the same time, we completed our acquisition of Macromedia, which positions us for future growth by accelerating our strategy to provide a powerful engagement platform. Going forward, we will meet a wider set of customer needs and have a significantly greater opportunity to expand into new markets, particularly in the mobile and enterprise segments."
 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were $0.31.  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, which excludes the net tax impact of the repatriation of certain foreign earnings and investment gains, were $0.30.
 
GAAP net income was $156.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to $113.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and $144.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.  Non-GAAP net income, which excludes, as applicable, the net tax impact of the repatriation of certain foreign earnings, and investment gains and losses, was $151.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to $110.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and $146.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were $0.31 based on 508.6 million weighted average shares. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.23 reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, based on 500.6 million weighted average shares, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.29 reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, based on 507.8 million weighted average shares.

First Quarter and Fiscal Year 2006 Non-GAAP Financial Targets
 
The following table shows Adobe's non-GAAP financial targets reconciled to GAAP financial targets included in this release.
 
Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures.  Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations.  Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review both GAAP information that includes the investment gains and losses, the net tax impact of the repatriation of certain foreign earnings, purchase accounting adjustments related to business combinations, restructuring charges and stock-based compensation impact of SFAS 123R discussed below, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.
 
In accordance with GAAP, Adobe incurs investment gains and losses from its venture program.  These charges are otherwise unrelated to Adobe's ongoing business operations and are excluded from its non-GAAP financial information.
Also, in accordance with GAAP, Adobe included the net tax impact of the repatriation of certain foreign earnings.  This tax impact is not indicative of Adobe's ongoing business operations and thus is excluded from its non-GAAP financial information.
 
For the first quarter and fiscal year 2006, Adobe's GAAP financial targets include purchase accounting adjustments related to business combinations, restructuring charges and the stock-based compensation impact of SFAS 123R. These charges are otherwise unrelated to Adobe's ongoing business operations and are excluded from its non-GAAP financial targets.
