2006 Performance Share Program
 
Effective February 2, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Adobe Systems Incorporated (the "Company") adopted the 2006 Performance Share Program (the "Program"). The Committee established the Program to align the new leadership team to achieve key integration milestones and create stockholder value and to retain key executives. All members of the Company's executive management team and other key members of senior management (the "Program Participants") will participate in the Program. Awards under the Program were granted February 2, 2006 in the form of "Performance Shares" pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2003 Equity Incentive Plan or Amended 1994 Performance and Restricted Stock Plan. Performance Shares will be earned, if at all, following the 2007 fiscal year, subject to specified change in control exceptions, and will be settled in fully-vested shares of Adobe common stock.
 
The Program requires that the Company achieve at least 90% of the Board of Directors-approved operating income targets for the combined fiscal years 2006 and 2007 as a minimum threshold before the Program Participants will earn any Performance Shares under the Program.  If this threshold is achieved, the number of Performance Shares potentially earned under the Program will be 150% of the target payout, and the actual number of Performance Shares earned under the Program will be based on the achievement of eight specific integration-related metrics, including both revenue and non-revenue metrics.  Each metric will be weighted equally.  The Committee may alter the payout for the achievement of non-revenue metrics based on such factors as market reception, revenue, commitment of strategic partners and quality of product shipped, and the payout for revenue metrics will correlate to the percent of such metric achievement.  The Plan Participants may receive less than the Performance Share target payouts under the Program, and in no event may the actual payout exceed 150% of target payout.
 
The Performance Share target and maximum payouts for the Company's executive officers are as follows:

  The Program provides the opportunity for certain key Employees to receive shares of Stock based on the performance of the Company.  In general, the Committee will select certain key Employees to participate in the Program at the beginning of a Performance Period.

The Committee also may establish, in its sole discretion, Performance Goals and Other Performance Goals for annual, quarterly or other periods within the applicable Performance Period.
