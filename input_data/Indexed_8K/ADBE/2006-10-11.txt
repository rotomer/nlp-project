Item 8.01 Other Events.
As reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 1, 2006, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2006, we have just concluded a voluntary review of our stock option granting practices covering the period from 1997 to 2006.  Our review earlier this year of executive officer grants uncovered no improper grants to our executive officers. Following this management review, in the fourth quarter of this year, our Board of Directors formed a Special Committee of outside Directors to undertake a broader review of annual non-executive employee option grants. The Special Committee enlisted the assistance of independent legal counsel and an independent accounting firm. The Special Committee uncovered no fraud or intentional wrongdoing. The Special Committee did find certain instances relating to grants made to employees where the list of employees and/or shares allocated to them was not sufficiently definitive for the grant to be deemed final as of the reported grant date.  In other instances, the Special Committee found that adjustments were made to some employee grants after the grant date without a corresponding change to the measurement date. We believe the impact of these instances to be immaterial for each prior year as well as in the aggregate to our expected current fiscal year 2006 results.
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 allows for the adjustment of the cumulative effect of prior year immaterial errors in assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the fiscal year, with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the potential impacts of adopting SAB 108.  We expect that, under SAB 108, certain historical uncorrected differences related to the instances described above will be corrected for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of December 5, 2005. We have not yet completed our analysis, however, we estimate that the expected net reduction to the opening retained earnings balance as of December 5, 2005, will be approximately $25 to $30 million.  We are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting SAB 108 and, as a result, the actual reduction to the opening retained earning balance as of December 5, 2005 could be different than the $25 to $30 million estimate.
