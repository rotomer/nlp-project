2007 Performance Share Program
Effective January 24, 2007, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Adobe Systems Incorporated (the "Company") adopted the 2007 Performance Share Program (the "Program"). The Committee established the Program to help align the Company's management with those of its stockholders, as well as to support the retention of key executives. All members of the Company's executive management team and other key members of senior management (the "Program Participants") will participate in the Program. Awards for executive officers under the Program were approved on January 24, 2007 in the form of "Performance Shares" pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended 1994 Performance and Restricted Stock Plan.
The Program requires that the Company achieve at least 90% of its revenue target for fiscal year 2007 as approved by the Board of Directors as a minimum threshold before Program Participants earn any Performance Shares under the Program.  If this initial threshold is achieved, the actual number of Performance Shares earned is based on the achievement of two equally-weighed metricsoperating margin and revenue growth.  The payout of Performance Shares will correlate to the Company's 2007 fiscal year-end achievement for each metric, which minimum achievement must be at least 95% of the established operating margin and revenue growth target amounts. Plan Participants may receive less than the Performance Share target payouts under the Program, and in no event may an actual payout exceed 200% of a target payout amount.
Performance Shares will be earned initially (if at all) following the Company's 2007 fiscal year-end, subject to specified change in control exceptions. Each Program Participant must be employed through the first anniversary of his or her grant date to be eligible. For executive officers, Performance Shares will vest 25% on the certification date of the achievement of the applicable metrics by the Board of Directors, or the first anniversary of the Program Participant's grant date, whichever is later.  Additional vesting of the Performance Shares will be 25% each year on the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, contingent upon the Program Participant's continued service to the Company.
The Performance Share target and maximum payouts for the Performance Shares granted to the Company's executive officers are as follows:
 
The description of the Program contained herein is a summary of the material terms of the Program, does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable Program used in connection with the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan or Amended 1994 Performance and Restricted Stock Plan. The 2007 Performance Share Program under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1, and the Award Grant Notice and Performance Share Award Agreement for use in connection with grants under this plan are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2.

2007 Executive Officer Annual Incentive Plan
On January 24, 2007, the Committee approved the terms of the 2007 Executive Officer Annual Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which is applicable to executive officers of the Company. Each participant is eligible to receive an incentive bonus calculated as a percentage of the executive's base salary.
The Plan requires that the Company achieve at least 90% of the Company's revenue target for fiscal year 2007 as approved by the Board of Directors as a minimum threshold before participants are eligible to earn an incentive bonus under the Plan. If this initial threshold is achieved, the actual incentive bonus earned by each participant is calculated as a percentage of a Board of Directors-approved target bonus. For fiscal year 2007, the target bonus as a percentage of annual base salary for each executive officer of the Company is as follows:
 
The actual incentive bonus for each participant is determined based on the Company's achievement of established revenue growth (including shippable backlog) and non-GAAP operating margin results (corporate achievement) and individual achievement tied to the 2007 fiscal year operating plan and individual strategic objectives (individual results). 
If corporate achievement is below 95% of target, no incentive bonus is paid.
If corporate achievement is between 95% and 100% of target, each participant's annual incentive bonus is calculated as follows:
Incentive Bonus = Participant Target Bonus x Funding Level % x Individual Results %
The Funding Level is determined based on the combined results of the corporate achievement. The Funding Level percentage may range from a minimum of 36% (if corporate achievement for each metric meets a 95% threshold) to 200% (if corporate achievement for each metric reaches at least 107%). Individual results are based on the achievement of goals tied to the corporate operating plan and strategic objectives.
If corporate achievement is above 100% of target, the Incentive Bonus is calculated as follows:
Incentive Bonus = Participant Target Bonus x Unit Multiplier % x Individual Results %
The Unit Multiplier is determined for each business and functional unit of the Company based on the allocated Funding Level for each unit multiplied by each participant's incentive bonus target within each particular business and functional unit. The aggregate Funding Level is calculated by multiplying the Funding Level percentage achieved by the sum of each participant's incentive bonus target. Funds are allocated to the business and functional units based on relative contribution to the Company's success.
The maximum incentive bonus per participant per Plan year is 300% of target bonus, and the incentive bonus cannot exceed $5 million per participant in any Plan year.
A copy of the Plan summary is attached as Exhibit 10.5 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

How Awards Are Earned Under the Program.
            
  The Program provides the opportunity for certain key Employees to earn shares of Stock based on the performance of the Company.  In general, the Committee will select certain key Employees to participate in the Program at the beginning of a Performance Period.  Upon selection to participate in the Program, each such Designated Participant will be granted a Maximum Award equal to the number of shares of Stock that will be represented by an Actual Award to such Designated Participant if (i) specified levels of applicable Performance Goals are achieved during the Performance Period, (ii) the Committee does not reduce the Maximum Award on account of the degree of achievement of applicable Other Performance Goals, and (iii)the Designated Participant continues to render Service to the Company or any other Participating Company during the entire Performance Period and any subsequent additional vesting period.

As required by Section 5.4(b)(iii) of the Plan and in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code, in no event may a Maximum Award be granted to a Designated Participant such that the number of shares of Stock that could be earned by such Designated Participant as an Actual Award would

exceed two hundred thousand (200,000) shares of Stock for each full fiscal year of the Company contained in the Performance Period for such Actual Award.
  Each key Employee of the Company or any other Participating Companywho is designated by the Committee in writing for participation in the Program for a particular Performance Period shall be eligible for a Maximum Award with respect to such Performance Period.  The Committee may designate a key Employee who commences Service after the beginning of a particular Performance Period as eligible to receive a prorated Maximum Award for such Performance Period.  The determination as to whether an individual is a Designated Participant shall be made by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be binding and conclusive on all persons.
(b)
          
Designated Participants.
No Employee shall have any right to be a Designated Participant in the Program, to continue as a Designated Participant, or to be granted a Maximum Award or Actual Award under the Program.  The Company is not obligated to give uniform treatment (., number of shares subject to Maximum Awards) to Employees or Designated Participants under the Program.  Participation in the Program as to a particular Performance Period does not convey any right to participate in the Program as to any other Performance Period.
e.g
  The Performance Goals for a particular Performance Period and Other Performance Goals, if applicable, and their relative weights, will be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion. The Committee also may establish, in its sole discretion, Performance Goals and Other Performance Goals for annual, quarterly or other periods within the applicable Performance Period.  The Performance Goals and Other Performance Goals for a Performance Period or for shorter periods within a Performance Period are not required to be identical to the Performance Goals and Other Performance Goals for any other Performance Period or shorter period within a Performance Period.  The Committee may establish Performance Goals and Other Performance Goals for the Company that differ from those established for one or more other Participating Companies and may establish different Performance Goals and Other Performance Goals for each Designated Participant or for groups of Designated Participants.

No Employment or Service Rights.
  The Committee shall be responsible for all decisions and recommendations regarding Program administration and retains final authority regarding all aspects of Program administration, the resolution of any disputes, and application of the Program in any respect to a Designated Participant.

The Committee may, without notice, amend, suspend or terminate the Program; that no such action may adversely affect any then outstanding Award unless (i) expressly provided by the Committee and (ii) with the consent of the Participant, unless such action is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule.

provided, however,

In addition, you may not be issued any shares of Stock pursuant to an Actual Award unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of issuance be in effect with respect to the shares of Stock or (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares of Stock may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Stock pursuant to an Actual Award shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, you may designate a third party who, in the event of your death, shall thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of shares of Stock pursuant to Section 3 of this Award Agreement.
10.

The determination as to whether an individual is a Designated Participant shall be made by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be binding and conclusive on all persons.
(b)

Exhibit 10.5
:
OBJECTIVES
Drive growth and accountability
                 
Drive execution of operating plan and strategic objectives
                 
Motivate and inspire employees to contribute at peak performance
                 
: Executive officers of the Company who are employed (full time or part time) during the full eligibility period (fiscal year) are eligible to participate in the Plan. If an executive officer is hired after the beginning of the Plan eligibility period, the executive officer's bonus will be prorated, assuming the executive is employed by the Company in an eligible position at the end of the eligibility period.
ELIGIBILITY
: Each participant's incentive bonus target is calculated as a percentage of annual base salary.
INCENTIVE BONUS TARGET
: Incentive bonuses are paid on annual basis approximately 45-60 days from fiscal year-end.
PAYMENT SCHEDULE
: As a minimum threshold for participants to earn an incentive bonus under the Plan, the Company must achieve at least 90% of its revenue target for the fiscal year.
INITIAL THRESHOLD ACHIEVEMENT
: Once the initial threshold is met, a Funding Level for a particular year is determined based on the corporate achievement of two metrics - revenue growth (including shippable backlog) and non-GAPP operating profit. The Funding Level is a percentage determined based on the combined results of the metric targets. The Funding Level percentage may range from a minimum of 36% (if corporate achievement for each metric meets a 95% threshold) to 200% (if corporate achievement for each metric reaches at least 107%).
INCENTIVE BONUS COMPONENTS
If corporate achievement is below 95% of target, no incentive bonus is paid.
If corporate achievement is between 95% and 100% of target, the incentive bonus is calculated as follows:
Target Bonus x Funding Level % x Individual Results %
Determination of Individual Results - Based on the achievement of goals tied to the corporate operating plan and strategic objectives. 100% of the incentive bonus is weighted on Individual Results and tied to corporate achievement.
If corporate achievement is above 100% of target, the incentive bonus is calculated as follows:
Target Bonus x Unit Multiplier x Individual Results
Step 1: Determine Aggregate Funding - The aggregate Funding Level for the Plan is calculated by multiplying the Funding Level percentage achieved by the sum of each participant's incentive bonus target.
Step 2: Determine Allocation of Funds - These funds are then allocated to the Company's business and functional units based on relative contribution to the Company's success.
Step 3: Determine Unit Multiplier - For each Company business and functional unit, allocated funds are divided by the sum of individual participant target bonuses within each particular business and functional unit.
Step 4: Calculate incentive bonus
MAXIMUM AWARD: 
Maximum incentive bonus per participant is 300% of target.
                                         
Incentive bonus per participant cannot exceed $5 million per year.
