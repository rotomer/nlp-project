Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Adobe Systems Incorporated (the "Company") entered into the Amendment to Credit Agreement dated as of August 13, 2007 with Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent and the other lenders party thereto (the "Amendment"). The Amendment amends the Company's existing Credit Agreement dated as of February 16, 2007 among BNP Paribas, Keybank National Association, and UBS Loan Finance LLC as Co-Documentation Agents; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Syndication Agent; Bank of America, N.A. as Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender; the other lenders party thereto; and Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers (the "Original Credit Agreement," and together with the Amendment, the "Credit Agreement").
The Credit Agreement is a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, providing for loans to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
The Original Credit Agreement provided for $500 million in lender loan commitments, with an option by the Company to request an additional $500 million in commitments from any of the original lenders and additional eligible lenders if such original lenders decline to participate.  In connection with such a request by the Company, the lenders party to the Amendment approved an increase in the loan commitments by $500 million, for a total of $1 billion. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company retains an option to request an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate loan commitment of $1.5 billion.
The loans bear interest, payable quarterly, based on a pricing grid tied to the financial covenant.  Commitment fees are payable quarterly at rates between 0.05% and 0.15% per year based on the same pricing grid.
The Credit Agreement contains various customary representations, warranties, and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The affirmative covenants require the Company and its subsidiaries to deliver financial statements and certificates; pay and perform obligations; preserve and maintain its corporate existence; maintain property and insurance; comply in all material respects with applicable laws; maintain proper books and records; maintain necessary approvals and authorizations; and other requirements. The negative covenants include some limitations on creating and incurring liens; indebtedness; mergers and acquisitions; dispositions; changes in the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries; transactions with affiliates; use of proceeds; and other matters. The financial covenant requires the Company not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio.
Customary defaults are also contained in the Credit Agreement, including defaults related to the nonpayment of principal of a loan; nonpayment of interest on a loan; failure of the Company to perform or observe any specified term, covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement; the failure of a loan party to perform or observe any other covenant or agreement contained in a loan document; cross-defaults on other indebtedness or guarantees; insolvency; an inability to pay debts by the Company or a subsidiary; and other matters. In an event of default as specified in the Credit Agreement, the lenders may terminate the Credit Agreement, and all loan amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, would become immediately due and payable.
The lenders' commitments under the Credit Agreement will terminate on February 16, 2012 and any borrowings outstanding will mature and be payable on such date.  The Company may request, however, on any anniversary of the closing date of the Original Credit Agreement, that each lender extend the maturity date of its loan commitments for an additional year.
Certain of the lenders and their respective affiliates are currently performing, have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking, and other financial advisory services for the Company and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
As of August 16, 2007, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same-Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing.  Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.  Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.
.  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that each Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.

Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Committed Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
  If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or (c) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Committed Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

.  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
