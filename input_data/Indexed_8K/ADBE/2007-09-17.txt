Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 17, 2007, Adobe issued a press release announcing its financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2007. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
The attached press release includes non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and forecasted non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth fiscal quarter 2007.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use financial information that does not include: (a) the stock-based compensation impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123revised 2004 ("SFAS 123(R)"), "Share-Based Payment" and related tax impact; (b) amortization of Macromedia stock-based compensation and related tax impact; (c) restructuring and other charges and related tax impact; (d) amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology and related tax impact; (e) investment gains and losses and related tax impact; and (f) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies.  We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.
As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:
.  These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options and employee stock purchases under SFAS 123(R). We exclude stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) in fiscal 2006, we did not include expenses related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases directly in our financial statements, but elected, as permitted by SFAS 123, to disclose such expenses in the footnotes to our financial statements.  As we apply SFAS 123(R), we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of SFAS 123(R) to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  While stock-based compensation expense calculated in accordance with SFAS 123(R) constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater

transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.  In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors' operating results.
.  We are amortizing stock-based compensation related to unvested options assumed in connection with our acquisition of Macromedia in December 2005. The stock-based compensation is expected to be fully amortized by the end of fiscal 2009.  We exclude these items because these expenses are non-cash in nature and because the non-GAAP financial measures which exclude this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity, and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  We further believe that excluding this expense is useful to investors in that it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.  In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors' operating results.
B.
Amortization of Macromedia stock-based compensation and related tax impact
                                    
.  We incurred Board of Director approved restructuring charges associated with realigning our business upon the acquisition of Macromedia in December 2005.  These actions were taken to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure.  In connection with the worldwide restructuring plan, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and for the closure of Adobe facilities.  We also recognized costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts held by us.  We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.  It is possible, however, that additional charges related to our facility leases may be incurred for various reasons including changes in cost estimates, the date the facility is vacated, subtenant leases, etc.
C.
Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact
                                    
.  We incur amortization of purchased intangible assets primarily in connection with our acquisition of Macromedia in December 2005. Purchased intangibles include (a) developed technology and (b) core technology and patents. Developed technology relates primarily to Macromedia products across all of Macromedia product lines that had reached technological feasibility as of December 2005. Core technology and patents represent primarily a combination of Macromedia's processes, patents and trade secrets developed through years of experience in design and development of its products. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated.  Although, the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We also incurred charges related to (i) incomplete technology in connection with certain small acquisitions and (ii) prior activity in connection with a technology license arrangement. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
D.
Amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology and related tax impact
                                   
.  We incur investment gains and losses on the sale and exchange of equity securities that are held directly and also indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly-held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations.  We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
E.
Investment gains and losses and related tax impact
                                     
. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.
F.
                                     
Effective Tax Rate
We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures
should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.

SAN JOSE, Calif.  September 17, 2007
 Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today reported financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2007 ended August 31, 2007.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 Non-GAAP Financial Targets
The following tables show Adobe's non-GAAP financial targets reconciled to GAAP financial targets included in this release.
 
Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures.  Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations.  Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable,

both GAAP information that includes the stock-based compensation impact of SFAS 123R and related tax impact, amortization of Macromedia stock-based compensation and related tax impact, restructuring and other charges and related tax impact, amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology and related tax impact, investment gains and losses and related tax impact, the net tax impact of the R&D tax benefit, the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.  Whenever Adobe uses such a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure.  Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.
