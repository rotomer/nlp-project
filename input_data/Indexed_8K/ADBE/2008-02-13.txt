Amendment to
Retention Agreement with Shantanu Narayen
 
Effective February 11, 2008, Adobe and Shantanu Narayen entered into the First Amendment to Retention Agreement (the "Amendment"), which amends the original Retention Agreement  between Adobe and Mr. Narayen, dated January 12, 1998 (the "Original Retention Agreement").
 
Pursuant to the Original Retention Agreement, in the event Adobe (or any successor of Adobe) terminated Mr. Narayen's employment without cause or as a result of his disability, or if Mr. Narayen resigns for good reason (collectively, an "Involuntary Termination"), in any case within a 24 month period following a change in control, then:
 
Mr. Narayen would have the right to receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) the sum of his salary and target bonus, multiplied by (ii) 2 plus 1/12 for each year of completed service with Adobe (not in excess of 12) (the number determined in accordance with clause (ii) hereafter referred to as the "Severance Multiple");
                
th
 
Mr. Narayen's equity awards would vest in full and become exercisable (other than performance share unit awards, which would continue to be governed by their current terms); and
                
 
Mr. Narayen and his eligible dependents would continue to be eligible to participate in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe benefit plans applicable to him immediately prior to his Involuntary Termination for a period of time beginning on the date of Involuntary Termination and continuing for the number of years equal to the Severance Multiple.
                
 
The Amendment provides for:
 
Mr. Narayen's equity awards to vest in full (including performance share unit awards) and become exercisable as of the date of a change in control;
                
 
In lieu of the benefit payments specified in the Original Retention Agreement described above, Adobe would pay Mr. Narayen's COBRA premiums for the period of time equal to Mr. Narayen's Severance Multiple or the number of months Mr. Narayen is eligible for COBRA coverage, whichever is less; provided however, if Mr. Narayen becomes covered under another employer's health plan, then such COBRA premium payments would immediately cease;
                
 
Compliance with the new requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, including the delayed payment of benefits as determined pursuant to Section 409A;
                
 
A release of claims by Mr. Narayen before any payments are made under the Original Retention Agreement and Amendment;
                 
 
The greatest after-tax benefit for Mr. Narayen if an amount payable under the Original Retention Agreement or Amendment constitutes a parachute payment; and
                 
 
The inclusion of certain other clarifying changes.
                 
The Amendment was approved in connection with Mr. Narayen's appointment as Adobe's Chief Executive Officer, effective December 1, 2007, and to further align the terms of Mr. Narayen's Original Retention Agreement with the terms of Adobe's Executive Severance Plan in the Event of Change of Control, which provides for severance benefits to senior management of Adobe upon a change of control of Adobe.
 
The descriptions contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Original Retention Agreement and the Amendment.  A copy of the form of Original Retention Agreement was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.44 to Adobe's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 28, 1997, filed on February 17, 1998. A copy of the Amendment is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.
 
Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control
 
On February 11, 2008, the Executive Compensation Committee approved an amendment to Adobe's Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control (the "Severance Plan") to update the treatment of performance awards in connection with a change of control of Adobe.  Pursuant to the amendment, all outstanding performance awards would vest in full upon the participant's termination without cause, or if the participant resigns for good reason, in any case within a 24 month period following a change of control.
 
The description of the amendment to the Severance Plan contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Severance Plan. A copy of the Severance Plan, as amended, is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2.

Release of Claims
Exhibit A
 
5.
    
Section 4 entitled is replaced in its entirety with the following:
Limitation on Payments
 
"In the event that it is determined by the Accounting Firm that any amount payable to you under this Plan, alone or when aggregated with any other amount payable or benefit provided to you pursuant to any other plan or arrangement of the Company, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, then notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, the amounts payable will not exceed the amount which produces the greatest after-tax benefit to you.  For purposes of the foregoing, the greatest after-tax benefit will be determined within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such payment to you.  The Company shall request a determination in writing by the Accounting Firm of whether the full amount of the payments to you, or a lesser amount, will result in the greatest after-tax benefit to you.  As soon as practicable thereafter, the Accounting Firm shall determine and report to the Company and you the amount of such payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to you.  For the purposes of
 
such determination, the Accounting Firm may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  The Company and you shall furnish to the Accounting Firm such information and documents as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request in order to make their required determination.  The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the Accounting Firm may reasonably charge in connection with its services contemplated by this Section.  If a reduced amount of the payments will give rise to the greatest after tax benefit, the reduction in the payments and benefits shall occur in the following order unless you elects in writing a different order prior to the last day of the year preceding the date on which the event that triggers the payment occurs: (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards (including Performance Awards) other than stock options; (iii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of other benefits paid to you.  In the event that acceleration of compensation from your equity awards (including Performance Awards) is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be canceled in the reverse order of the date of grant unless you elect in writing a different order for cancellation prior to the last day of the year preceding the date on which the event that triggers the payment occurs."
 
6.
    
Section 5 entitled is replaced in its entirety with the following:
Legal Fees and Expenses
 
"The Company shall pay or reimburse you for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses which reflect common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred by you as a result of any bona fide claim, action or proceeding (a) arising out of your termination of employment during the Term, (b) contesting, disputing or enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or (c) arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision thereof.  The payments or reimbursements provided for herein shall be paid by the Company and its subsidiaries promptly (but in no event more than five (5) business days) following receipt of a written request for payment or reimbursement, as the case may be.  It is intended that each installment of payments under this Section 5 is a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that the payments under this Section 5 satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(11)."
 
7.  The following definitions shall be amended and restated in their entirety in Section 7 entitled :

For purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on your part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you with willful malfeasance or gross negligence and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was not materially adverse to the best interest of the Company.

Exhibit 10.2
Adobe Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") has adopted this Executive Severance Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of December 12, 2006, for the benefit of certain key employees of the Participating Company Group.  The Plan was amended effective January 24, 2008 for compliance with Code Section 409A, and amended effective February 11, 2008 to update the treatment of performance awards.
 
The Company considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take reasonable steps to retain its key management personnel.  Further, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and questions which might arise among management in the context of a Change of Control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.
 
The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of its members of management of the Company to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible Change of Control of the Company.
 
The Company hereby adopts this Executive Severance Plan In the Event of a Change of Control for the benefit of its employees who are eligible as provided in the Plan.

This Plan shall terminate automatically five (5) yearsfrom the Effective Date unless extended by the Company or unless a Change of Control shall have occurred prior thereto, in which case the Plan shall terminate following the later of the date which is at least twenty-four (24) months after the occurrence of a Change of Control or the payment of all Severance Benefits due under the Plan.
Plan Termination
 
.  Any person who believes he or she is entitled to benefits under this Plan may submit a claim for benefits.  The claim must be in writing and should state the claimant's reasons for claiming these benefits.  The claims should be sent to the Executive Severance Plan Administrative Committee of Adobe Systems Incorporated.  If the claim is denied, in whole or in part, written notice of the denial will be provided within ninety (90) days of initial receipt of the claim.  Such notice will include an explanation of the factors on which the denial is based and what, if any, additional information is needed to support the claim.  Further review of the claim may be obtained by filing a written request for review.  An individual whose

Claims for Benefits
claim for benefits is denied may file a request for review with the Committee within sixty (60) days.  After receiving a request for review, the Committee will render a final decision within sixty (60) days, unless circumstances require an extension of an additional sixty (60) days for the review.  In this case, the Committee will notify the claimant in writing of the need for an extension.  The Committee's decision will be in writing, setting forth the specific reasons for the decision, as well as specific references to the Plan provisions upon which the decision is based.
 
.  The Company shall pay or reimburse a Group I Participant for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses which reflect common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred by such Group I Participant as a result of any bona fide claim, action or proceeding (a) arising out of such Group I Participant's termination of employment during the Term, (b) contesting, disputing or enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Plan or (c) arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability of this Plan or any provision thereof.  The payments or reimbursements provided for herein shall be paid by the Participating Company Group promptly (but in no event more than five (5) business days) following receipt of a written request for payment or reimbursement, as the case may be.  It is intended that each installment of payments under this Section 7 is a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that the payments under this Section 7 satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(11).

Section 8.
              
Miscellaneous
 
8.1           .  Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the employ of the Participating Company Group or shall affect the terms and conditions of a Participant's employment with the Participating Company Group prior to the commencement of the Term.
No Contract of Employment
 
8.2           .  This Plan is intended to be (a) an employee welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA and (b) a "top-hat" plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Participating Company Group.
ERISA Plan
 
8.3           .  All payments provided under this Plan, other than payments made pursuant to any other Participating Company Group employee benefit plan which provides otherwise, shall be paid in cash from the general funds of the Participating Company Group, and no special or separate fund shall be established, and no other segregation of assets made, to assure payment.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Participating Company Group hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Participating Company Group.
Source of Payments
 
8.4           .  For the purpose of this Plan, notices and all other communications provided for in this Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by overnight courier or United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the Executive Severance Plan Administrative

Committee, Adobe Systems Incorporated, 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704, with a copy to the General Counsel of the Company, or to a Participant at the address set forth in the Participating Company Group's payroll records or to such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
 
8.5           .  No benefit under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged as security for indebtedness or otherwise encumbered by any Participant or subject to any legal process for the payment of any claim against a Participant.
Nonalienation of Benefits
 
8.6           .  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Plan shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect.
Validity
 
8.7           .  The headings contained in this Plan are intended solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the rights of the parties to this Plan.
Headings
 
8.8           .  This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA.
Governing Law

Section 9.
              
Successors; Binding Agreement
 
9.1           .  The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform the obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , , that no such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this Section 9, the "Company" shall include the Company as defined in Section 1.9 and any successor to its business and/or assets which assumes and agrees to perform the obligations arising under this Plan by operation of law or otherwise.
Assumption by Successor
provided
however
 
9.2           .  This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Participant (and such Participant's personal representatives and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change of Control or by operation of law.  This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Participant' personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If a Participant should die while any amount would still be payable hereunder if such Participant had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to such Participant's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to such Participant's estate.
Enforceability; Beneficiaries
.  As a condition to the receipt of Severance Benefits, each Participant must execute and allow to become effective a release of claims in a form satisfactory to the Committee, with such execution occurring not prior to the Date of Termination and not later than 45 days after the Participant's receipt thereof.  The date on which such release becomes effective is the "Release Effective Date".  No Severance Benefits shall be paid to a Participant under this Plan prior to the Release Effective Date.  The form of release shall not cause the Participant to waive or release any claims or rights a Participant may have to be indemnified by the Company under applicable law or the terms of any then-effective indemnification agreement or obligation.
