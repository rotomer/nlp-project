Section 2  Financial Information
 
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On June 16, 2008, Adobe issued a press release announcing its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended May 30, 2008. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
 
The attached press release includes non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP effective tax rate and forecasted non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP non-operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures that exclude: (A) the stock-based compensation impact of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123revised 2004 ("SFAS 123R"), "Share-Based Payment" and related tax impact; (B) restructuring and other charges and related tax impact; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology and related tax impact; (D) investment gains and losses and related tax impact; and (E) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies.  We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.
 
As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:
 
A..  These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options, restricted stock units and performance shares and employee stock purchases under SFAS 123R including the amortization of stock-based compensation related to unvested options assumed in connection with our acquisition of Macromedia in December 2005. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2006, we did not include stock-based compensation expenses directly in our financial statements, but elected, as permitted by SFAS 123, to disclose such expenses in the footnotes to our financial statements.  As we apply SFAS 123R, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of SFAS 123R to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  While stock-based compensation expense calculated in accordance with SFAS 123R constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.  In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to
            Stock-based compensation impact of SFAS 123R and related tax impact
our competitors' operating results.
 
B..  We incurred Board of Director approved restructuring charges associated with realigning our business upon the acquisition of Macromedia in December 2005.  These actions were taken to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure.  In connection with the worldwide restructuring plan, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and for the closure of Adobe facilities.  We also recognized costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts held by us.  We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
            Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact
C..  We incur amortization of purchased intangible assets primarily in connection with our acquisition of Macromedia in December 2005. Purchased intangibles include (a) developed technology and (b) core technology and patents. Developed technology relates primarily to Macromedia products across all of Macromedia product lines that had reached technological feasibility as of December 2005. Core technology and patents represent primarily a combination of Macromedia's processes, patents and trade secrets developed through years of experience in design and development of its products. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated.  Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We also incurred charges related to (i) amortization of purchased intangible assets and incomplete technology in connection with certain small acquisitions and (ii) prior activity in connection with a technology license arrangement. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
            Amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology and related tax impact
 
D..  We incur investment gains and losses on the sale and exchange of equity securities that are held directly and also indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly-held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations.  We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
            Investment gains and losses and related tax impact
 
E.             . Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.
Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes
 
and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.
We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Adobe Reports Strong Second Quarter Results
 
 
Product Mix and Geographic Diversity Drive 19 Percent Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth
 
SAN JOSE, Calif.  June 16, 2008 
Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today reported financial results for its second quarter ended May 30, 2008.
 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, Adobe achieved revenue of $886.9 million, compared to $745.6 million reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and $890.4 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  This represents 19 percent year-over-year revenue growth.  Adobe's second quarter revenue target range was $855 to $885 million.
 
"Our strong performance in Q2 was driven by the product mix and geographic diversity of our business," said Shantanu Narayen, president and chief executive officer. "We continue to execute against our strategy, and are well positioned for solid financial performance in the second half of this year and beyond."
 
Second Quarter GAAP Results
 
Adobe's GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were $0.40, based on 542.4 million weighted average shares. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.25 reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 based on 603.4 million weighted average shares, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.38 reported in the first quarter of fiscal
2008 based on 571.3 million weighted average shares. Adobe's second quarter GAAP earnings per share target range was $0.35 to $0.37.
 
GAAP operating income was $260.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $180.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and $275.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  As a percent of revenue, GAAP operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was 29.3 percent, compared to 24.2 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and 30.9 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
 
GAAP net income was $214.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $152.5 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and $219.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
 
Second Quarter Non-GAAP Results
 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were $0.50.  This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.37 reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.48 reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  Adobe's second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share target range was $0.45 to $0.47.
 
Adobe's non-GAAP operating income was $349.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $282.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and $359.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  As a percent of revenue, non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was 39.4 percent, compared to 37.8 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and 40.3 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
 
Non-GAAP net income was $272.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2008, compared to $223.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and $273.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
 
A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided at the end of this press release.
 
Adobe Provides Third Quarter Financial Targets
 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, Adobe announced it is targeting revenue of $855 million to $885 million.  The Company also stated it is targeting an operating margin of approximately 29 percent on a GAAP basis, and an operating margin of approximately 38.5 percent on a non-GAAP basis.
 
In addition, Adobe is targeting its share count to be between 544 million and 548 million shares in the third quarter.  The Company also is targeting GAAP and non-GAAP non-operating income to be approximately $4 million.  Adobe's GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 25 percent, and its non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 26 percent.
 
These targets lead to a third quarter diluted earnings per share target range of $0.34 to $0.36 on a GAAP basis, and a earnings per share target range of $0.45 to $0.47 on a non-GAAP basis.
 
A reconciliation between these GAAP and non-GAAP financial targets is provided at the end of this press release.
 
Third quarter financial targets do not include the impact of a $90 million acquisition of intellectual property rights closed in June, which Adobe believes will not affect the Company's non-GAAP targets.
 
Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including those related to revenue, operating margin, non-operating income, tax rate, share count, earnings per share, and business momentum which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

computers, printers, or other non PC-devices, adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which Adobe does business, difficulty in predicting revenue from new businesses, costs related to intellectual property acquisitions, disputes and litigation, inability to protect Adobe's intellectual property from third-party infringers, use, disclosure or malicious attack, failure to realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and difficulty in integrating such acquisitions, changes to Adobe's distribution channel, disruption of Adobe's business due to catastrophic events, risks associated with international operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles, impairment of Adobe's goodwill or intangible assets, unanticipated changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations, Adobe's inability to attract and retain key personnel, impairment of our investment portfolio due to further deterioration of the capital markets, market risks associated with Adobe's equity investments, and interruptions or terminations in Adobe's relationships with turnkey assemblers. For further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, individuals should refer to Adobe's SEC filings.
 
The financial information set forth in this press release reflects estimates based on information available at this time.  These amounts could differ from actual reported amounts stated in Adobe's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended May 30, 2008, which the Company expects to file in July 2008.

Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures.  Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations.  Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable,  both GAAP information that includes the stock-based compensation impact of SFAS 123R, restructuring and other charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology, investment gains and losses and the related tax impact of these items, the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.  Whenever Adobe uses such a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure.  Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.
