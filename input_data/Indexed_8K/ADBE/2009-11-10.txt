Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
On November 10, 2009, we announced a workforce reduction to appropriately align our costs in connection with our 2010 operating plan (the "Restructuring Plan"). As a result, we expect to eliminate approximately 680 full-time positions worldwide. We expect to record in the aggregate approximately $65.0 to $71.0 million in pre-tax restructuring charges associated with this Restructuring Plan. Included in these charges are (i) approximately $17.0 to $19.0 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and (ii) approximately $48.0 to $52.0 million related to employee severance arrangements. We expect to record approximately $18.0 to $20.0 million of these charges in the fourth fiscal quarter ended November 27, 2009. We expect to complete the majority of the activities related to the Restructuring Plan by the end of fiscal 2010. Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures.
 
The Restructuring Plan relates only to those employees and facilities that were associated with Adobe prior to the acquisition of Omniture, Inc. on October 23, 2009. Adobe expects to incur additional restructuring expenses relating to Omniture's operations. These costs will be included in the assumed liabilities of Omniture as of October 23, 2009 and will be recorded as part of the total acquisition purchase price of Omniture.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
