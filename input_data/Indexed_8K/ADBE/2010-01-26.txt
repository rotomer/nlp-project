Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or, at the Issuer's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer shall have exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 6 hereof the Issuer shall mail a notice (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder with a copy to the trustee describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to purchase Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (other than as may be required by law) (such date, the "Change of Control Payment Date").

Holders of Notes electing to have Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender their Notes, with the form entitled "Repurchase Exercise Notice Upon a Change of Control" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice, or transfer their Notes to the paying agent by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the paying agent, prior to the close of business on the third business day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
The Issuer shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
 
In addition, the Issuer shall not purchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
 
If Holders of not less than 95% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer, as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer shall have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the right
 
of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).
 
For purposes of the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the following definitions are applicable:
 
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any one of the following:
 
(a) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Issuer's assets and the assets of the Issuer's subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than to the Issuer or one of its subsidiaries;
 
(b) the consummation of any transaction (including without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our outstanding Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares;
 
(c) the Issuer consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Issuer, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Issuer's outstanding Voting Stock or the outstanding Voting Stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Issuer's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; or
 
(d) the adoption of a plan relating to the Issuer's liquidation or dissolution.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be considered to be a Change of Control if (a) the Issuer becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company and (b) immediately following that transaction, (1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of the holding company are substantially the same as the holders of the Issuer's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (2) no person or group is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than a majority of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the holding company.
 
"Change of Control Triggering Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Ratings Event.
"Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of Moody's); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of S&P); and the equivalent investment grade rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Agencies appointed by the Issuer.
 
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, and its successors.
 
"Rating Agency" means each of Moody's and S&P; provided, that if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available, the Issuer shall appoint a replacement for such Rating Agency that is a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act.
 
"Ratings Event" means the Notes cease to be rated Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies on any day during the period (the "Trigger Period") commencing on the date 60 days prior to the first public announcement by the Issuer of any Change of Control (or pending Change of Control) and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control (which Trigger Period will be extended for so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies).
 
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
 
"Voting Stock" of any specified person as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
 
8.             Defaults and Remedies.
 
If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer) under the Indenture occurs with respect to the Notes and is continuing, then the Trustee may and, at the direction of the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, shall by written notice, require the Issuer to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any.  If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.  Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it has received indemnity as it reasonably requires.  The Indenture permits, subject to
 
certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.  The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Notes notice of certain continuing defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
 
9.             Authentication.
 
This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Note.
 
10.           Abbreviations and Defined Terms.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Note or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
 
11.           CUSIP Numbers.
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuer has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes as a convenience to the Holders of the Notes.  No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Notes and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or, at the Issuer's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after the public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer shall have exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 6 hereof the Issuer shall mail a notice (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder with a copy to the trustee describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to purchase Notes on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (other than as may be required by law) (such date, the "Change of Control Payment Date").

Holders of Notes electing to have Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender their Notes, with the form entitled "Repurchase Exercise Notice Upon a Change of Control" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice, or transfer their Notes to the paying agent by book-entry transfer pursuant to the applicable procedures of the paying agent, prior to the close of business on the third business day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
 
The Issuer shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.
 
In addition, the Issuer shall not purchase any Notes if there has occurred and is continuing on the Change of Control Payment Date an Event of Default under the Indenture, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.

"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any one of the following:

(b) the consummation of any transaction (including without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our outstanding Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares;
 
(c) the Issuer consolidates with, or merges with or into, any person, or any person consolidates with, or merges with or into, the Issuer, in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which any of the Issuer's outstanding Voting Stock or the outstanding Voting Stock of such other person is converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of the Issuer's Voting Stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; or
 
(d) the adoption of a plan relating to the Issuer's liquidation or dissolution.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be considered to be a Change of Control if (a) the Issuer becomes a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company and (b) immediately following that transaction, (1) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of the holding company are substantially the same as the holders of the Issuer's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction or (2) no person or group is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than a majority of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the holding company.

"Investment Grade" means a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of Moody's); a rating of BBB- or better by S&P (or its equivalent under any successor rating category of S&P); and the equivalent investment grade rating from any replacement Rating Agency or Agencies appointed by the Issuer.
 
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, and its successors.
 
"Rating Agency" means each of Moody's and S&P; provided, that if either of Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Notes or fails to make a rating of the Notes publicly available, the Issuer shall appoint a replacement for such Rating Agency that is a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act.
 
"Ratings Event" means the Notes cease to be rated Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies on any day during the period (the "Trigger Period") commencing on the date 60 days prior to the first public announcement by the Issuer of any Change of Control (or pending Change of Control) and ending 60 days following consummation of such Change of Control (which Trigger Period will be extended for so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies).
 
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
 
"Voting Stock" of any specified person as of any date means the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
 
8.             Defaults and Remedies.
 
If an Event of Default (other than certain bankruptcy Events of Default with respect to the Issuer) under the Indenture occurs with respect to the Notes and is continuing, then the Trustee may and, at the direction of the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, shall by written notice, require the Issuer to repay immediately the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any.  If a bankruptcy Event of Default with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, then the entire principal amount of the Outstanding Notes will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.  Holders of Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.  The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Notes unless it has received indemnity as it reasonably requires.  The Indenture permits, subject to
 
certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.  The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Notes notice of certain continuing defaults or Events of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.
 
9.             Authentication.
 
This Note shall not be valid until the Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on this Note.
 
10.           Abbreviations and Defined Terms.
