Section 409A
 
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the
Committee
determines that any Award is, or may reasonably be, subject to Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance (including such Department of Treasury guidance issued from time to time), the
Committee
may, without the Participant's consent, adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the
Committee
determines are necessary or appropriate to (A) exempt the Award from Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (B) comply with the requirements of Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance.
 
In addition, and except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, if the Company determines that any Award granted under this Plan constitutes, or may reasonably constitute, "deferred compensation" under Section 409A and the Participant is a "specified employee" of the Company at the relevant date, as such term is defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), then any payment or benefit resulting from such Award will be delayed until the earliest date following the Participant's "separation from service" with the Participating Company Group within the meaning of Section 409A on which the Company can provide such payment or benefit to the Participant without the Participant's incurrence of any additional tax or interest pursuant to Section 409A, with all payments or benefits due thereafter occurring in accordance with the original schedule.  In addition, this Plan and the benefits to be provided hereunder are intended to comply in all respects with the applicable provisions of Section 409A.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for, or required to reimburse or otherwise make any Participant whole for, any tax or penalty imposed on, or losses incurred by, any Participant that arises in connection with the potential or actual application of Section 409A to any Award granted hereunder.
