Section 2  Financial Information
 
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On December 20, 2010, Adobe issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 3, 2010. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
 
The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, and forecasted non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology; (D) resolution of an income tax audit, (E) investment gains and losses; (F) the R&D tax benefit; and (G) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies.  We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.
 
As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:
 
A..  Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in acco rdance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitate comparisons to our co mpetitors' operating results.
            Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact
 
B..  In November 2009, we initiated restructuring activities to align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. In November 2008, we initiated restructuring actions associated with realigning our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. In connection with these restructuring actions, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. We also incurred restructuring charges associated with realigning our business upon the acquisition of Macromedia in December  2005 (the "Macromedia Restructuring"). The actions in the Macromedia Restructuring were taken to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with the Macromedia Restructuring, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated, the closure of Adobe facilities and the cancellation of certain contracts held by us.  We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
            Restructuring charges and related tax impact
 
C..
            Amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology and related tax impact
 
We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measu res facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period. Further, prior to our adoption of new business combination accounting at the beginning of fiscal 2010, we incurred charges related to in-process research and development in connection with certain of our acquisitions. We expensed this upon acquisition as it represented incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the date of the acquisition.
 
DDuring the fiscal year ended December 3, 2010, we realized a one-time tax benefit as a result of the resolution of an income tax audit for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. We have excluded this item because this tax benefit is unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
esolution of an income tax audit and related tax impact.
.            R
 
E. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations.  We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
.            Investment gains and losses and related tax impact
 
F.             . In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe anticpates a one time tax benefit due to the reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit, which was retroactively extended to January 1, 2010. The impact of this law change will be reflected in our first quarter fiscal year 2011 tax provision as a discrete item related to the tax credit for fiscal year 2010. Adobe has excluded this item because this tax benefit is not reflective of ongoing results and has no direct correlation to the operation of Adobe's business.
Impact of the R&D Tax Benefit
 
G.            . Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.
Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes
 
We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.

Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures.  Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations.  Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information that includes the stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology, the resolution of an income tax audit, investment gains and losses, the R&D tax benefit, and the related tax impact of all of these items, the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever Adobe uses such a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure.  Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.

The Board (or an appropriate committee thereof) will, in its sole discretion, establish the rules and procedures for such deferrals.
 
6.            
SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE
. The grant of your Award and the issuance of any shares of Stock thereunder shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities.

APPLICATION OF SECTION 409A

Absent a proper deferral election, it is intended that all of the benefits and payments provided under this Award satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A 1(b)(4), and this Award will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions.  To the extent not so exempt, this Award and the payments and benefits to be provided hereunder are intended to, and will be construed and implemented so as to, comply in all respects with the applicable provisions of Code Section 409A, and any provisions calling for pa yments on a termination of employment or other service shall be read to mean a "separation from service" (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409-1(h) without reference to alternative definitions thereunder).  For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 2(b)(2)(iii)), any right to receive any installment payments under this Award shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award, to the extent that (i) one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you upon "separation from service" pursuant to this Plan would constitute deferred compensation subject to the
requirements of Code Section 409A, and (ii) you are a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A at the time of separation from service, then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments or benefits is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments and benefits shall not be provided to you prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of separation from service, (ii) the date of your death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation on you.  Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments and benefits deferred pursua nt to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to you, and any remaining payments and benefits due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein.

TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
2.1          .  This Option is intended to be an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code but the Company does not represent or warrant that this Option qualifies as such.  The Participant should consult with the Participant's own tax advisor regarding the tax effects of this Option
Tax Status of Option
and the requirements necessary to obtain favorable income tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code, including, but not limited to, holding period requirements.  (NOTE TO PARTICIPANT: If the Option is exercised more than three (3) months after the date on which you cease to be an Employee (other than by reason of death or permanent and total disability as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), the Option will be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option and not as an Incentive Stock Option to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code.)
 
2.2          .  To the extent that the Option (together with all Incentive Stock Options granted to the Participant under all stock option plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) becomes exercisable for the first time during any calendar year for shares having a Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section 2.2, options designated as Incentive Stock Options are taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of stock is determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted.  If the Code is amended to provide for a different limitation from that set forth in this Section 2.2, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date required or permitted by such amendment to the Code.  If the Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section 2.2, the Participant may designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising.  In the absence of such designation, the Participant shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first.  Separate certificates representing each such portion shall be issued upon the exercise of the Option.  (NOTE TO PARTICIPANT: If the aggregate Exercise Price of the Option (that is, the Exercise Price multiplied by the Number of Option Shares) plus the aggregate exercise price of any other Incentive Stock Options you hold (whether granted pursuant to the Plan or any other stock option plan of the Participating Company Group) is great er than $100,000, you should contact the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to ascertain whether the entire Option qualifies as an Incentive Stock Option.)]

Cashless Exercise
 
4.4            Regardless of any action taken by the Participating Company Group with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholdings or payments  (), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Participating Company Group (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of shares acquired pursuant to such exercise, or the receipt of any dividends and (ii) does not commit to structure the term s of the grant or any other aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.  In particular, while this Option is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5) and will be construed in accordance therewith to the greatest extent permitted by law, the Participant acknowledges that this Option is exempt from Section 409A of the Code only if the exercise price per share is at least equal to the "fair market value" per share of the Stock on the Date of Option Grant and there is no other impermissible deferral of compensation associated with the Option.  At the time of exercise of the Option, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Participating Company Group to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Participating Company Group.  In this regard, at the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any other time as reasonably requested by the Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for withholding of all applicable Tax Related Items by the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option.  Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under applicable law, the Participating Company Group may (i) sell or arrange for the sale of shares acquired by the Participant to meet the withholding obligation of Tax-Related Items and/or (ii) withhold in shares, provided that only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding amount are withheld.  Finally, the Participant shall pay to the Participating Company Group any amount of the Tax-Related Items that the Participating Company Group may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be sat isfied by the means previously described.  The Company shall have no obligation to process the exercise of the Option or to deliver shares of Stock until the obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this section have been satisfied by the Participant.

4.5            The Participant hereby authorizes the Company, in its sole discretion, to deposit for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship of which the Company has notice any or all shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Option.  Except as provided by the preceding sentence, a certificate for the shares as to which the Option is exercised shall be registered in the name of the Participant, or, if applicable, in the names of the heirs of the Participant.

4.6            The grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise of the Option shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities.  The Option may not be exercised if the

.
issuance of shares of Stock upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  In addition, the Option may not be exercised unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Option be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  THE PARTICIPANT IS CAUTIONED THAT THE OPTION MAY NOT BE EXERCISED UNLESS THE FOREGOING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED.  ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTICIPANT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXERCIS E THE OPTION WHEN DESIRED EVEN THOUGH THE OPTION IS VESTED.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.

  Regardless of any action taken by the Participating Company Group with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholdings or payments (), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Participating Company Group (i) makes no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including the grant, vesting or exercise of the Opt ion, the subsequent sale of shares acquired pursuant to such exercise, or the receipt of any dividends and (ii) does not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any other aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.  In particular, while this Option is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5) and will be construed in accordance therewith to the greatest extent permitted by law, the Participant acknowledges that this Option is exempt from Section 409A of the Code only if the exercise price per share is at least equal to the "fair market value" per share of the Stock on the Date of Option Grant and there is no other impermissible deferral of compensation associated with the Option.  At the time of exercise of the Option, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Participating Company Group to satisfy all withholdin g obligations of the Participating Company Group.  In this regard, at the time the Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at any other time as reasonably requested by the Company, the Participant hereby authorizes withholding of all applicable Tax-Related Items from payroll and any other amounts payable to the Participant, and otherwise agrees to make adequate provision for withholding of all applicable Tax Related Items by the Participating Company Group, if any, which arise in connection with the Option.  Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under applicable law, the Participating Company Group may (i) sell or arrange for the sale of shares acquired by the Participant to meet the withholding obligation of Tax-Related Items and/or (ii) withhold in shares, provided that only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding amount are withheld. Finally, the Participant shall pay to the Participating Company Group any amount of the Tax-Related Items that the Participating Company Group may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.

The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares subject to the Option shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

all decisions with respect to future Option grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;

To the extent not so exempt, this Award and the payments and benefits to be provided hereunder are intended to, and will be construed and implemented so as to, comply in all respects with the applicable provisions of Code Section 409A, and any provisions calling for payments on a termination of employment or other service shall be read to mean a "separation from service" (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409-1(h) without reference to alternative definitions thereunder).  For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 2(b)(2)(iii)), any right to receive any installment payments under this Award shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award, to the extent that (i) one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by you upon "separation from service" pursuant to this Plan would constitute deferred compensation subject to the
 
requirements of Code Section 409A, and (ii) you are a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A at the time of separation from service, then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments or benefits is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments and benefits shall not be provided to you prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of separation from service, (ii) the date of your death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation on you.  Upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments and benefits deferred pursua nt to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to you, and any remaining payments and benefits due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein.
