Section 2  Financial Information
 
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On March 22, 2011, Adobe issued a press release announcing its financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 4, 2011. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
 
The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, and forecasted non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles; (D) resolution of an income tax audit; (E) investment gains and losses; (F) the net tax impact of the R&D tax benefit; (G) the net tax impact of a one-time acquisition-related charge; and (H) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. 60; We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.
 
As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:
 
A.
                                  
Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact
.  Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation stand ards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.  In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors' operating results.
 
B.
                                    
Restructuring charges and related tax impact
.  In November 2009, we initiated restructuring activities to align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. In November 2008, we initiated restructuring actions associated with realigning our business strategies based on then-current economic cond itions. In connection with these restructuring actions, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities.
 
C.
                                    
Amortization of purchased intangibles and related tax impact
.  We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be cons umed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
 
D
.
                                   
R
esolution of an income tax audit and related tax impact.
During the fiscal year
ended December 3, 2010, we realized a one-time tax benefit as a result of the resolution of an income tax audit for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. We have excluded this item because this tax benefit is unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
 
E
.
                                     
Investment gains and losses and related tax impact
.  We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indir ectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations.  We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
 
F.
                                     
Net tax impact of the R&D Tax Benefit.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we realized a one-time tax benefit due to the reenactment of the Federal Research and Development tax credit, which was retroactively extended to January 1, 2010. The impact of this law change was reflected in our first quarter fiscal 2011 tax provision as a discrete item related to the tax credit for fiscal 2010. We have excluded this item because this tax benefit is not reflective of ongoing results and has no direct correl ation to the operation of our business.
 
G.
                                    
Net tax
impact
of a one-time acquisition-related charge
.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a one-time charge related to our acquisition of Demdex.
 
H.
                                   
Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes
. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.
 
We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.

SAN JOSE, Calif.  March 22, 2011
Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 4, 2011.
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.028 billion, compared to $858.7 million reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and $1.008 billion reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2011 Financial Targets
 
"Our hearts go out to everyone in Japan. Although Adobe has a very diversified business, Japan is our second largest country from a revenue perspective and March is typically our biggest revenue month of the year there due to fiscal year-end spending. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we are being prudent and have reduced our revenue expectation for our second quarter by $50 million  or roughly one-third of our original Q2 revenue expectation for Japan," said Mark Garrett, executive vice president and CFO of Adobe.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Adobe is now targeting revenue of $970 million to $1.02 billion.
 
The Company's operating margin is targeted to be 24.5 percent to 27.5 percent on a GAAP basis, and 34 percent to 36 percent on a non-GAAP basis.  In addition, the Company is targeting its share count to be between 510 million and 512 million shares, and it is targeting non-operating expense between $16 million and $20 million.  Adobe's GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be approximately 22 percent.
 
These targets lead to a second quarter diluted earnings per share target range of $0.33 to $0.40 on a GAAP basis, and an earnings per share target range of $0.47 to $0.54 on a non-GAAP basis.
 
Reconciliation between these GAAP and non-GAAP financial targets is provided at the end of this press release.

Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures.  Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations.  Adobe's management believes it is useful for itse lf and investors to review, as applicable,  both GAAP information that includes the stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, resolution of an income tax audit, investment gains and losses, the net tax impact of the R&D tax benefit, the net tax impact of a one-time acquisition related charge, and the related tax impact of all of these items, the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.  Whenever Adobe uses such a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure.  Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most direc tly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.
