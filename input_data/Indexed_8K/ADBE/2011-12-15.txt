Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On December 15, 2011, Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe") issued a press release announcing its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and year ended December 2, 2011. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
 
The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, and forecasted non-GAAP diluted net income per share.
 
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
 
For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring and other charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles; (D) resolution of an income tax audit; (E) investment gains and losses; (F) income tax adjustments; and (G) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies.  We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.
 
As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:
 
A.Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements.  In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors' operating results.
            Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. 
 
B..  During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated, the write-down of certain assets that were no longer useful to us based on changes in our business and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring and other charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
            Restructuring and other charges and related tax impact
 
C..  We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
            Amortization of purchased intangibles and related tax impact
 
DDuring the fiscal year ended December 3, 2010, we realized a one-time tax benefit as a result of the resolution of an income tax audit for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. We have excluded this item because this tax benefit is unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
esolution of an income tax audit and related tax impact.
.            R
 
E.  We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations.  We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
.            Investment gains and losses and related tax impact
 
F.             .  Other income tax adjustments are primarily related to one-time tax charges in connection with certain acquisitions, a one-time tax benefit associated with certain portions of a favorable California state income tax ruling and
Income tax adjustments
prior year items such as a one-time tax benefit due to the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal Research and Development tax credit which was retroactively extended to January 1, 2010. We exclude these adjustments because these items are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
 
G.            . Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.
Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes
 
We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.
 
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On December 12, 2011, our Executive Compensation Committee approved the adoption of the Adobe Systems Incorporated 2011 Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control for Prior Participants (the "Prior Participant Change of Control Plan") and the Adobe Systems Incorporated 2011 Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control (together with the Prior Participant Change of Control Plan, the "Change of Control Plans"), each of which became effective on December 13, 2011 and are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.  The Change of Control Plans replace Adobe's prior Executive Severance Plan in the Event of a Change of Control, as amended, which terminated in accordance with its terms on December 12, 2011.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
Adobe Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") has adopted this Executive Severance Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of December 13, 2011, for the benefit of certain key employees of the Participating Company Group.
 
The Company considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take reasonable steps to retain its key management personnel. Further, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and questions which might arise among management in the context of a Change of Control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.
 
The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of its members of management of the Company to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible Change of Control of the Company.
 
The Company hereby adopts this Executive Severance Plan In the Event of a Change of Control for the benefit of its employees who are eligible as provided in the Plan.

To the extent not so exempt, this Plan and the payments and benefits to be provided hereunder are intended to, and will be construed and implemented so as to, comply in all respects with the applicable provisions of Code Section 409A.  For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), any right to receive any installment payments under this Plan (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.

For purposes of the foregoing, the greatest after-tax benefit will be determined within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such payment to the Participant.  The Company shall request a determination in writing by the Accounting Firm of whether the full amount of the payments to the Participant, or a lesser amount, will result in the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.  As soon as practicable thereafter, the Accounting Firm shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant the amount of such payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.  For the purposes of such determination, the Accounting Firm may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Accounting Firm such information and documents as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request in order to make their required determination.  The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the Accounting Firm may reasonably charge in connection with its services contemplated by this Section.  If a reduced amount of the payments will give rise to the greatest after tax benefit, the reduction in the payments and benefits shall occur in the following order:  (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards (including Performance Awards) other than stock options; (iii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of other benefits paid to the Participant.  Within any such category of payments and benefits (that is, (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)), a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A and then with respect to amounts that are.  In the event that acceleration of compensation from the Participant's equity awards (including Performance Awards) is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be canceled, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, in the reverse order of the date of grant.
Parachute Payments
 
3.2           .  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, the benefits provided hereunder shall be in lieu of any other severance plan and/or retention agreement benefits provided by any Participating Company.

As used in this Section 8, the "Company" shall include the Company as defined in Section 1.9 and any successor to its business and/or assets which assumes and agrees to perform the obligations arising under this Plan by operation of law or otherwise.
Assumption by Successor
 
8.2           .

Enforceability; Beneficiaries

The date on which such release becomes effective is the "Release Effective Date".  In no event will Severance Benefits be paid to a Participant under this Plan prior to the Release Effective Date.  The form of release shall not cause the Participant to waive or release any claims or rights a Participant may have to be indemnified by the Company under applicable law or the terms of any then-effective indemnification agreement or obligation.
Release of Claims
 

Exhibit 10.2
Adobe Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") has adopted this Executive Severance Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of December 13, 2011, for the benefit of certain key employees of the Participating Company Group.
 
The Company considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take reasonable steps to retain its key management personnel. Further, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and questions which might arise among management in the context of a Change of Control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.
 
The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of its members of management of the Company to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible Change of Control of the Company.
 
The Company hereby adopts this Executive Severance Plan In the Event of a Change of Control for the benefit of its employees who are eligible as provided in the Plan.

To the extent not so exempt, this Plan and the payments and benefits to be provided hereunder are intended to, and will be construed and implemented so as to, comply in all respects with the applicable provisions of Code Section
409A.  For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), any right to receive any installment payments under this Plan (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, to the extent that (i) one or more of the payments or benefits received or to be received by a Participant upon Separation from Service pursuant to this Plan would constitute deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A, and (ii) the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A at the time of Separation from Service, then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments or benefits is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the related adverse taxation under Section 409A, such payments and benefits shall not be provided to the Participant prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Separation from Service, (ii) the date of the Participant's death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under Section 409A without the imposition of adverse taxation on the Participant.

Limitation on Payment of Benefits

Parachute Payments
.  In the event that it is determined by the Accounting Firm that any amount payable to a Participant under this Plan, alone or when aggregated with any other amount payable or benefit provided to such Participant pursuant to any other plan or arrangement of the Participating Company Group, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, then notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, the amounts payable will not exceed the amount which produces the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.  For purposes of the foregoing, the greatest after-tax benefit will be determined within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to such payment to the Participant.  The Company shall request a determination in writing by the Accounting Firm of whether the full amount of the payments to the Participant, or a lesser amount, will result in the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.  As soon as practicable thereafter, the Accounting Firm shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant the amount of such payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.  For the purposes of such determination, the Accounting Firm may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Accounting Firm such information and documents as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request in order to make their required determination.  The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the Accounting Firm may reasonably charge in connection with its services contemplated by this Section.  If a reduced amount of the payments will give rise to the greatest after tax benefit, the reduction in the payments and benefits shall occur in the following order:  (i) reduction of cash payments; (ii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards (including Performance Awards) other than stock options; (iii) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock options; and (iv) reduction of
 
other benefits paid to the Participant.  Within any such category of payments and benefits (that is, (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)), a reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A and then with respect to amounts that are.  In the event that acceleration of compensation from the Participant's equity awards (including Performance Awards) is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be canceled, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, in the reverse order of the date of grant.
 
3.2
          
Non-Duplication of Benefits
.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, the benefits provided hereunder shall be in lieu of any other severance plan and/or retention agreement benefits provided by any Participating Company.  The Severance Benefits and other benefits provided under this Plan shall be reduced by any severance paid or provided to a Participant by a Participating Company under any other plan or arrangement, including any pay in lieu of notice under WARN.
 
3.3
          
Indebtedness of Participant

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.4 the Plan may not be amended prior to its termination, or, in the event the Plan is extended as provided in this Section 4.4, the date on which it would have terminated under Section 4.5 had it not been extended.
 
4.5
          
Plan Termination
.  This Plan shall terminate automatically three (3) years from the Effective Date unless extended by the Company or unless a Change of Control shall have occurred prior thereto, in which case the Plan shall terminate following the later of the date which is at least twelve (12) months after the occurrence of a Change of Control or the payment of all Severance Benefits due under the Plan.
 
Section 5.
              
Claims, Inquiries and Appeals
.  Any application or request for benefits, inquiries about the Plan or inquiries about payment or future rights under the Plan must be submitted to the Plan Administrator in writing by an individual (or his or her authorized representative) (the "") at the following address:
Applicant
 
5.1
          
Denial of Claims
.  The Applicant will be notified within ninety (90) days after the claim is filed whether the claim is allowed or denied, unless the Applicant receives written notice from the Plan Administrator before the end of the ninety (90) day period stating that special circumstances require an extension of the time for decision, such extension not to extend beyond the day which is one hundred eighty (180) days after the day the claim is filed.
 
5.2
          
Manner and Content of Denial of Initial Claims
.  If the Plan Administrator denies a claim, it must provide to the Applicant, in writing or by electronic communication:  (a) the specific reasons for the denial; (b) a reference to the Plan provision upon which the denial is based; (c) a description of any additional information or material that the Applicant must provide in order to perfect the claim; (d) an explanation of why such additional material or information is necessary; (e) a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures; and (f) a statement of the Applicant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a denial on review of the initial denial.
 
5.3
          
Appeal of Denied Claim
.  A request for review of a denied claim must be made in writing to the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days after receiving notice of denial.  The decision upon review will be made within sixty (60) days after the Plan Administrator's receipt of a request for review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision will be rendered not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of a request for review.  A notice of such an extension must be provided to the Applicant within the initial sixty (60) day period and must explain the special circumstances and provide an expected date of decision.  The Plan Administrator will afford the Applicant an
opportunity to review and receive, without charge, all relevant documents, information and records and to submit issues and comments in writing to the Plan Administrator.  The Plan Administrator will take into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Applicant relating to the claim regardless of whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination.
 
5.4
          
Decision on Review
.  Upon completion of its review of an adverse initial claim determination, the Plan Administrator will give the Applicant, in writing or by electronic notification, a notice containing:  (a) its decision; (b) the specific reasons for the decision; (c) the relevant Plan provisions on which its decision is based; (d) a statement that the Applicant is entitled to receive, upon request and without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information in the Plan's files which is relevant to the Applicant's claim for benefits; (e) a statement describing the Applicant's right to bring an action for judicial review under Section 502(a) of ERISA; and (f) if an internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion was relied upon in making the adverse determination on review, a statement that a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion will be provided without charge to the Applicant upon request.
 
5.5
          
Rules and Procedures
.  The Plan Administrator will establish rules and procedures, consistent with the Plan and with ERISA, as necessary and appropriate in carrying out its responsibilities in reviewing benefit claims.  The Plan Administrator may require an Applicant who wishes to submit additional information in connection with an appeal from the denial of benefits to do so at the Applicant's own expense.
 
5.6
          
Calculation of Time Periods
.  For purposes of the time periods specified in this Section 5, the period of time during which a benefit determination is required to be made begins at the time a claim is filed in accordance with the Plan procedures without regard to whether all the information necessary to make a decision accompanies the claim.  If a period of time is extended due to an Applicant's failure to submit all information necessary, the period for making the determination will be tolled from the date the notification is sent to the Applicant until the date the Applicant responds.
 
5.7
          
Exhaustion of Remedies
.  No legal action for benefits under the Plan may be brought until the Applicant (a) has submitted a written application for benefits in accordance with this Section 5, (b) has been notified by the Plan Administrator that the application is denied, (c) has filed a written request for a review of the application in accordance with the appeal procedure described in Section 5.3 above and (d) has been notified that the Plan Administrator has denied the appeal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Plan Administrator does not respond to a Applicant's claim or appeal within the relevant time limits specified in Sections 5.2 and 5.4, the Applicant may proceed with a legal action for benefits.
Section 6.
              
Legal Fees and Expenses
.  The Company shall pay or reimburse a Group I or Group II Participant for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses which reflect common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred by such Group I Participant or Group II Participant as a result of any bona fide claim, action or proceeding (a) arising out of such Group I Participant's or Group II Participant's termination of employment during the Term, (b) contesting, disputing or enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Plan or (c) arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability of this Plan or any provision thereof.  The payments or reimbursements provided for herein shall be paid by the Participating Company Group promptly (but in no event more than five (5) business days) following receipt of a written request for payment or reimbursement, as the case may be.  It is intended that each installment of payments under this Section 6 is a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that the payments under this Section 5 satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Code Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(11).
 
Section 7.
              
Miscellaneous
.
 
7.1
          
No Contract of Employment

7.2
          
ERISA Plan
.  This Plan is intended to be (a) an employee welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA and (b) a "top-hat" plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Participating Company Group.

To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Participating Company Group hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the Participating Company Group.
 
7.4
          
Notice
.  For the purpose of this Plan, notices and all other communications provided for in this Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by overnight courier or United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the Executive Severance Plan Administrative Committee, Adobe Systems Incorporated, 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704, with a copy to the General Counsel of the Company, or to a Participant at the address set forth in the Participating Company Group's payroll records or to such other address as either party may
have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
 
7.5
          
Nonalienation of Benefits

7.7
          
Headings
.  The headings contained in this Plan are intended solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the rights of the parties to this Plan.
 
7.8
          
Governing Law
.  This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California to the extent such laws are not preempted by ERISA.
 
Section 8.
              
Successors; Binding Agreement
.
 
8.1
          
Assumption by Successor
.  The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform the obligations under this Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this Section 8, the "Company" shall include the Company as defined in Section 1.9 and any successor to its business and/or assets which assumes and agrees to perform the obligations arising under this Plan by operation of law or otherwise.
 
8.2
          
Enforceability; Beneficiaries
.  This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Participant (and such Participant's personal representatives and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change of Control or by operation of law.  This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each Participant' personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If a Participant should die while any amount would still be payable hereunder if such Participant had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Plan to such Participant's devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to such Participant's estate.
Section 9.
              
Release of Claims
.  As a condition to the receipt of Severance Benefits, each Participant must execute and allow to become effective a release of claims in a form satisfactory to the Committee, with such execution occurring not prior to the Date of Termination, and with such release effective not later than 60 days after the Participant's Separation from Service.  The date on which such release becomes effective is the "Release Effective Date".  In no event will Severance Benefits be paid to a Participant under this Plan prior to the Release Effective Date.  The form of release shall not cause the Participant to waive or release any claims or rights a Participant may have to be indemnified by the Company under applicable law or the terms of any then-effective indemnification agreement or obligation.

Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures.  Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations.  Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable,  both GAAP information that includes the stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring and other charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, resolution of an income tax audit, investment gains and losses and the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.  Whenever Adobe uses such a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure.  Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.
