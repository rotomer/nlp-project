On
September 19, 2012
, Adobe Systems Incorporated (Adobe) issued a press release announcing its financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended
August 31, 2012
. A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.
The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, and forecasted non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.
These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expenses; (B) restructuring charges; (C) amortization of purchased intangibles; (D) investment gains and losses; (E) income tax adjustments; and (F) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors operating results.
As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures:
A.     
Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact.
Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP related to stock-based compensation including expense associated with stock-based compensation related to unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires or will require cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our liability related to our deferred compensation plan. Although deferred compensation expense constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense that typically requires current cash settlement by us and because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors operating results.
B.     
Restructuring charges and related tax impact.
During the past several years, we have initiated certain restructuring activities in order to align our costs in connection with both our operating plans and our business strategies based on then-current economic conditions. As a result, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for former Adobe employees whose positions were eliminated and the consolidation of leased facilities. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP results because such expense is not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
C.     
Amortization of purchased intangibles and related tax impact.
We incur amortization of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer
2
contracts and relationships and (iv) other intangibles. We expect to amortize for accounting purposes the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because this expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors operating results. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
D.     
Investment gains and losses and related tax impact.
We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results.
E.     
Income tax adjustments.
Other income tax adjustments related to a one-time tax charge in connection with a certain acquisition. We exclude these adjustments because these items are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations.
F.     
Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes.
Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations.
We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Adobe Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Financial Results
Creative Cloud Subscriptions Accelerate and Digital Marketing Suite Revenue Grows 40 Percent Year-Over-Year
SAN JOSE, Calif. - Sept. 19, 2012
-
Adobe Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq:ADBE) today reported financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2012 ended Aug. 31, 2012.
Adobe achieved revenue in Q3 FY2012 of $1.081 billion, within its targeted range of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion. During the quarter, the Company drove faster adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions than originally projected. As Adobe customers migrate from a legacy Creative Suite perpetual licensing model to new Creative Cloud subscriptions, revenue is recognized over time as opposed to at the time of purchase. This overachievement in subscriptions during the third quarter effectively transitioned approximately $29 million more perpetual revenue than expected to Creative Cloud.
In addition, the effect of currency impacted Q3 revenue negatively by approximately $9 million. Adjusting for these amounts in Adobe's reported results would have enabled the Company to achieve third quarter revenue towards the high-end of its targeted range.
Other Third Quarter Financial Highlights
A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided at the end of this press release.
Executive Quotes
Customers globally are adopting our new Creative Cloud subscription offering more quickly than we projected," said Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO of Adobe. "We are the leader in the fast-growing Digital Marketing category with 40 percent year-over-year Digital Marketing Suite revenue growth this quarter.
We're on a path to drive millions of subscribers to our Creative Cloud offering, as well as build a billion dollar SaaS business in Digital Marketing, said Mark Garrett, executive vice president and CFO of Adobe. This will drive higher long-term growth and create a large recurring revenue stream.
Financial Outlook
Adobe provided financial targets for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These targets reflect the effect of higher migration of customers to Creative Cloud than forecast earlier in the year.
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Adobe is targeting revenue of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion. On a diluted earnings per share basis, the company is targeting a range of $0.34 to $0.39 on a GAAP basis, and $0.53 to $0.58 on a non-GAAP basis. These targeted ranges factor in the addition of 125,000 new Creative Cloud subscriptions in the quarter, which represents approximately $94 million in Q4 perpetual revenue which would effectively move to subscription and ratable monthly recognition.
Adobe is targeting its Q4 share count to be between 500 million and 502 million shares, and it is targeting non-operating expense between $18 million and $20 million. Adobe's tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5 percent on a GAAP basis and 22.5 percent on a non-GAAP basis.
A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial targets is provided at the end of this press release.

Adobe will webcast its third quarter fiscal year 2012 earnings conference call today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time from its investor relations website:

Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including those related to revenue, additional Creative Cloud subscriptions and the resulting impact on revenue, growth in our Digital Marketing business, non-operating expense, tax rate, share count, earnings per share, increases in recurring revenue and our ability to execute against our strategy in our key growth areas, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: failure to develop, market and distribute products and services that meet customer requirements, introduction of new products and business models by competitors, failure to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, including our increased emphasis on a cloud and subscription strategy, fluctuations in subscription renewal or upgrade rates, continued uncertainty in economic conditions and the financial markets, difficulty in predicting revenue from new businesses and the potential impact on our financial results from changes in our business models, and failure to realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions.

For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to Adobe's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended Dec. 2, 2011 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 2, 2012 and June 1, 2012.
The financial information set forth in this press release reflects estimates based on information available at this time. These amounts could differ from actual reported amounts stated in Adobe's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for our quarter ended Aug. 31, 2012, which Adobe expects to file in Oct. 2012.
Adobe assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update these forward-looking statements.

financial targets reconciled to non-GAAP financial targets included in this release.
Adobe continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but believes evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Adobe believes to be its ongoing business operations. Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information that includes the stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring charges, amortization of purchased intangibles, investment gains and losses and the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes, and the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever Adobe uses such a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above.
