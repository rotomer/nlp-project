Exhibit 99.1 [ANALOG DEVICES LOGO] FOR RELEASE: MAY 14, 2003 4:00 P.M. EST ANALOG DEVICES REPORTS INCREASED REVENUE AND PROFITS FOR SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2003 Norwood, MA -- Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenues of $502 million and net income of $71.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2003, which ended May 3. Revenues increased 21% from the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Revenues increased 7% and net income increased 19% from the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Net income was $71.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2003, an increase of 19% sequentially. The quarter's diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) increased to $0.19, up from $0.04 in the same period a year ago and $0.16 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Operating income increased sequentially to 17.6% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, up from 15.8% in the previous quarter. Gross margins increased sequentially to 54.5% of sales, while inventories declined sequentially and days cost in inventory declined to 117 days from 125 days last quarter. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding declined to 44 days from 45 days last quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, cash balances increased by $102 million after spending $14 million on capital equipment. Cash and short-term investment balances at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2003 totaled $3.1 billion. "Both revenue and earnings were above the high end of estimates we provided on February 13, 2003, primarily as a result of stronger sales of analog products and continued strength in sales of DSP products," said Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "Analog product revenues grew 7% sequentially and accounted for approximately 78% of revenues, and DSP products grew 8% sequentially and accounted for approximately 22% of revenues."
"Growth this quarter was broad based with sales increasing across virtually all applications, across OEM and distributor channel customers and across all geographic regions," continued Mr. Fishman. "In the second quarter, orders for shipment in the next 13 weeks grew by approximately 16% from first quarter fiscal 2003 levels. Orders from both OEM customers and distributors grew sequentially and the book to bill ratio was well above one for the second quarter. Orders end customers placed with our distributors also grew sequentially and our distributors' book to bill ratio was above one." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "We are planning for revenues to grow 3-5% sequentially during the third quarter. In addition, we are planning for gross margin to increase slightly. Operating expenses will increase slightly due to salary increases for a portion of the employee population. As a result, GAAP diluted EPS are estimated at $0.20 to $0.21 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003."
