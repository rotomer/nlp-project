"Revenue grew quarter-to-quarter across a broad base of applications within the computer, communications, consumer, and industrial markets we serve."
Mr. Fishman continued, "The book-to-bill ratio was approximately one for the third quarter with strong order rates during July, the last month of the quarter."
