Exhibit 99.1 ANALOG DEVICES CALLS FOR REDEMPTION OF CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES Norwood, MA -- Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, announced today that the company has called for the redemption on October 1, 2003 of its 4.75 percent Convertible Subordinated Notes ("Notes") due 2005. The aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding is $1.2 billion. Prior to 5 p.m. EDT on September 30, 2003, holders may convert their Notes into shares of ADI common stock at a price of approximately $129.78 per share, or 7.7056 shares of ADI common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. Cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. The last reported closing price of ADI common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $41.00 per share on August 29, 2003. Alternatively, holders may have their Notes redeemed at a total redemption price of $1,042.75 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, consisting of $1,000 principal amount plus a premium of $19.00 and accrued interest of $23.75. Any Notes not converted on or before 5 p.m. EDT on September 30, 2003 will be automatically redeemed on October 1, 2003, after which interest will cease to accrue. A Notice of Redemption and a Letter of Transmittal, which may be used to surrender Notes for conversion or redemption, are being mailed to all registered holders of the Notes. Copies of the Notice of Redemption and the Letter of Transmittal may be obtained from the conversion and redemption agent, U.S. Bank National Association, by calling John Brennan at 617-603-6576. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ends January 31, 2004, ADI's pre-tax non-operating income will increase by approximately $3.5 million per quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, which ends November 1, 2003, there will be certain non-recurring items associated with the redemption which, in total, are not expected to be material to earnings.
