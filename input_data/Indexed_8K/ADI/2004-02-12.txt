Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices' First-Quarter Revenue Increases 30% Year-Over-Year, 9% Sequentially NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 12, 2004--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today reported that revenue rose 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $605.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended on January 31, 2004. Net income for the quarter was $116.8 million. The first quarter's diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.30, up from $0.16 for the same period one year ago and up from $0.23 for the immediately prior quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 17, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2004. "As a result of customer demand that continued to strengthen throughout the first quarter, we achieved financial performance well ahead of our previous expectations and fiscal year 2004 is clearly off to a great start," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "We experienced solid sequential and year-over-year revenue growth across the breadth of our high-performance analog and DSP product portfolio. "Shipments increased in all regions and end markets, particularly among the wide range of customers who design industrial and instrumentation systems, medical electronics, and automatic test equipment. Shipments to the consumer, communications, and computer end markets also grew during the quarter. "Gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 increased to 57.1% of sales, up from 55.8% of sales in the prior quarter. Increasing gross margin coupled with tight expense control resulted in operating margins rising to 24.1% of sales." Turning to the balance sheet Mr. Fishman said, "Our balance sheet continues to strengthen. Our cash and short-term investment balance grew by $190 million to $2.3 billion after $27 million of capital expenditures and a $15 million dividend payment. Days cost of sales in inventory declined to 103 days in the first quarter compared to 106 days in the previous quarter, while days sales in accounts receivable remained flat at 48 days." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "Customer order patterns are providing us with the best visibility we have had in many quarters. As a result, our backlog of products requested to ship within the next 13 weeks has increased sequentially by 23% to $475 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we are planning for revenues to grow sequentially by approximately 7% to 10%, which is approximately $650 to $665 million, and for EPS to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.35." Taking a long-term view Mr. Fishman concluded, "We believe high-performance analog and DSP will continue to be among the fastest-growing product categories within the semiconductor industry and that ADI can continue to gain market share in these areas. The pervasiveness of signal processing throughout virtually all types of electronic equipment provides ADI with the opportunity for significant revenue growth over the next few years."
