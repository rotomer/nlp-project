Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices' Second-Quarter Revenue Increases 35% Year-over-Year and Earnings Per Share More Than Double NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 13, 2004--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today reported revenue of $678.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended on May 1. Revenue increased 35% compared to the same period one year ago and 12% compared to the previous quarter. Net income for the second quarter was $152.6 million, more than double the $71.3 million for the same period in the prior year and 31% above the $116.8 million in the immediately prior quarter. The second quarter's diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.39, up from $0.19 for the same period one year ago and up from $0.30 for the immediately prior quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on June 16, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on May 28, 2004. "We had an excellent quarter with revenue, margins, and EPS all well above our expectations when the quarter began," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "Demand continued to accelerate during the second quarter, driven by the widespread adoption of our high-performance analog and DSP core technology." "In the second quarter, we saw growth across each of the major end markets we serve. The highest growth came from consumer electronics and from the industrial market which represents a wide range of customers designing factory automation systems, test equipment, medical electronics, and scientific instrumentation. We also saw good revenue growth from the communications and computer markets. "On a geographic basis, the strongest revenue growth was from North America. Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia also had good growth within the quarter. "Gross margins rose to 59.2% of sales, a new peak for ADI and a 210 basis point improvement over the 57.1% we achieved in the immediately prior quarter. In addition, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 31.5%, a sequential improvement of 150 basis points. As a result, operating margins rose sequentially by 360 basis points to 27.7% of sales. "Our balance sheet also continued to strengthen in the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments grew by $235 million to $2.5 billion. Days cost of sales in inventory declined to 102 days in the second quarter compared to 103 days in the previous quarter, while days sales in accounts receivable declined to 44 days compared to 48 days in the previous quarter." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "The 13-week backlog continues to grow, reaching $571 million at the close of the second quarter, a 20% sequential increase. We are planning for revenue to grow sequentially by approximately 7% to 10% during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to approximately $725 to $745 million, with continuing strong operating leverage. As a result, we estimate EPS to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.45."
