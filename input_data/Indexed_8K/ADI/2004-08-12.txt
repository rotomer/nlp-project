EXHIBIT 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Results for Fiscal Third Quarter 2004 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 12, 2004--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today reported revenue of $717.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended on July 31, 2004. Revenue increased 38% compared to the same period one year ago and 6% compared to the previous quarter. Net income for the third quarter was $169 million, more than double the $79 million reported for the same period in the prior year and 11% above the $152.6 million reported in the immediately prior quarter. The third quarter's diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.43, up from $0.21 for the same period one year ago and up from $0.39 for the immediately prior quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on September 15, 2004 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 27, 2004. "Our results in the third quarter were mixed, as margins improved and the balance sheet remained strong, but declining order rates led to slower than expected revenue growth," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO. "As a result, earnings came in at the low end of the guidance we provided on May 13, but earnings still grew at nearly twice the revenue growth rate for the quarter. "In the third quarter, we saw revenue growth across each of the major end markets we serve. The highest growth came from communications applications which span wireless, broadband, and a range of other telecommunications equipment. "On a geographic basis, revenue grew in most regions, led by 10% sequential growth in North America. Revenue in Europe and Southeast Asia also grew, while revenue in Japan was approximately flat. "Gross margins rose to 60% of sales, a new peak for ADI. In addition, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 31%, versus 31.5% in the immediately prior quarter. As a result, operating margins rose sequentially by 130 basis points to 29.0%, after rising 360 basis points last quarter." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Cash and short-term investments increased by $147 million to $2.69 billion. Days cost of sales in inventory was 104 days in the third quarter, up from 102 days in the second quarter, and well within our desired range of 100 to 110 days. Days sales in accounts receivable increased to 45 days compared to 44 days in the previous quarter." Commenting on order patterns, Mr. Fishman said, "Over the past three quarters, customers were ordering well ahead of consumption and the book-to-bill ratio was above 1.15. In the third quarter, the economy became more uncertain and since lead times shortened, customer and distributor order rates slowed. While our new orders during the third quarter were approximately equal to our sales, an unusually high level of cancellations resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.8 for the third quarter. Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "Our customers appear somewhat more cautious in the short term and therefore, we are planning for fourth quarter revenue that is approximately flat compared to third quarter revenue. We also expect gross margins and EPS for the fourth quarter to be about the same as for the third quarter." In closing, Mr. Fishman stated, "The rebalancing that took place in the third quarter between order rates and consumption does nothing to change our mid- to long-term view. The electronics industry continues to grow and signal processing content within electronics equipment continues to grow. We believe these trends are likely to continue into the future and provide an opportunity for ADI to grow revenue and profits for 2005 and beyond."
