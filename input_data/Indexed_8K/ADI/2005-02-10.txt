Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Reports Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 10, 2005--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE:ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, which ended January 29, 2005. For the first quarter, revenue was $580.5 million, diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.28, and net income totaled $107.4 million, or approximately 19% of sales. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on March 16, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on February 25, 2005. "Our revenue in the first quarter declined 4% compared to the same period one year ago and 8% compared to the immediately prior quarter," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "The majority of the sequential revenue decline was isolated to semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE) and wireless handset applications. The ATE revenue decline parallels the cyclical decline in the semiconductor industry. In wireless handsets, it appears clear that the rapid growth of the Chinese manufacturers in the first half of 2004 led to excess inventory which customers reduced over the past two quarters." Gross margins for the first quarter were 57.8%, up 70 basis points from the same quarter last year and down 170 basis points from the immediately prior quarter. Adjustments made to factory utilization and the impact of factory shutdowns during the holiday period impacted gross margins in the first quarter. Mr. Fishman explained, "However, these adjustments to factory utilization coupled with reductions in external wafer purchases allowed us to constrain the inventory growth to levels well below what we planned at the beginning of the quarter. "We also constrained spending during the first quarter, reducing operating expenses by 3.3% sequentially. As a result, operating profits for the first quarter remained strong at $124.7 million or 21.5% of sales." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Free cash flow for the quarter was $93 million as a result of cash flow from operations of $117 million, or 20% of sales, offset by capital expenditures of $24 million. During the first quarter, we also repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $161 million. The total common stock repurchased under the $500 million program approved by the board in August of 2004 now stands at 8.4 million shares for approximately $298 million. The number of shares repurchased to date under this program represents approximately 2% of shares outstanding." The company also paid dividends of $23 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion at the end of the first quarter. "Order patterns improved during the first quarter compared to the prior two quarters. In addition, we believe that the application areas which drove most of our revenue decline in the past two quarters are now at revenue levels that are unlikely to decline further this year. End customer demand improved to slightly above revenue for the first quarter, which was a significant improvement over the prior two quarters. Additionally, order rates increased in January and this momentum has continued into early February. These combined factors support our plan for sequential revenue growth in the second quarter. Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "We believe that the first quarter of fiscal 2005 will represent the trough for our quarterly revenue and we are currently planning for second quarter fiscal 2005 revenue to increase sequentially by 2% to 6%. "At these revenue levels, we expect gross margin to decline slightly during the second quarter because factory utilization will remain low as our plan is for inventory to be flat in dollars and down in days compared to the first quarter. Actual gross margins are dependent on the mix of business and utilization rates of our factories, but we expect gross margins to remain strong and above 57% during this cycle. As demand increases and utilization rates of our factories improve, we expect to realize gross margin leverage. "We are also planning for operating expenses to be approximately flat for the second quarter versus the first quarter. Based on these assumptions, we expect diluted EPS to be approximately $0.29 to $0.31 for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Despite the revenue decline of the past two quarters, we continued to invest in new product programs, winning customers across a wide range of applications. Based on a relatively stable global economic climate and forecasts that predict 2005 will be a good year for most economies around the world, we believe our investments in new product development will generate continued revenue and profit growth for ADI as the year unfolds."
