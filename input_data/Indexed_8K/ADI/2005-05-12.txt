Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Reports Increased Revenue and Profits for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2005; Board raises cash dividend to $0.10 from $0.06 per share and increases share repurchase program by $500 million. NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 12, 2005--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, which ended April 30, 2005. For the second quarter, revenue was $604 million, diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.31, and net income totaled $118 million, or 19% of sales. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per outstanding share of common stock for the second quarter, up from $0.06 in the first quarter. The dividend is payable on June 15, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on May 27, 2005. The Board also approved a $500 million increase to the company's share repurchase program. "Our second quarter turned out to be a good quarter for ADI. Revenue increased 4% sequentially and diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.31," said Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Revenue increased sequentially in every geographic region, except China, as customer inventory declines appear to be completed after a six-month correction. Revenue increased sequentially in both the OEM and distributor channels. "Looking at the end markets, the highest growth on a dollar basis came from the industrial end markets, which grew 11% sequentially, driven by growth from our instrumentation and automotive customers and the resumption of growth from some automatic test equipment (ATE) customers. Sales to consumer customers grew 16% sequentially, primarily as a result of increased market share in digital cameras and advanced digital TVs. Computer product revenue was down sequentially. Revenue from communications applications was approximately flat sequentially, as strong gains in wireless infrastructure were offset by continuing weakness in wireless handsets, particularly among customers in China," Mr. Fishman explained. By end market, approximately 41% of second quarter revenue was from industrial applications, which span a broad range of medical, security, automotive, instrumentation, and defense electronics applications, 31% from communications applications, 15% from consumer applications, and 13% from computer applications. According to Mr. Fishman, "Revenue from analog products increased by 6% compared to the immediately prior quarter and totaled 81% of sales. Most noteworthy was 12% sequential revenue growth in converters and 10% sequential revenue growth in amplifiers -- two product areas at the heart of ADI's franchise and where our market share is very high. Sales of other analog products, including power management, declined sequentially. DSP revenue, which was 19% of sales in the second quarter, declined 4% sequentially, as strong sequential growth in general-purpose DSP products was offset primarily by sequential declines in wireless handsets and broadband products. Gross margins for the second quarter were 57.4%, down 40 basis points from the immediately prior quarter as a result of lower factory utilization. "Operating expenses were approximately flat for the second quarter compared to both the immediately prior quarter and the same quarter last year. We kept tight control of expenses, despite absorbing the effect of annual salary increases and higher employee bonus accruals," said Mr. Fishman. "As a result, operating profits for the second quarter increased to approximately $134 million or 22% of sales." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Our balance sheet continued to strengthen in the second quarter. Inventories declined sequentially by $5 million. Days cost of sales in inventory was 124 days in the second quarter, down from 132 days in the first quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable decreased to 48 days compared to 51 days in the immediately prior quarter. "Cash flow from operations totaled $175 million or 29% of sales. In the second quarter, we spent $22 million on capital expenditures and we returned $146 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 3.4 million shares of ADI common stock for $124 million and by paying $22 million in dividends. As a result, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased slightly to $2.62 billion at the end of the second quarter. "For the past three quarters, since we announced the share repurchase program in August of 2004, ADI has generated approximately $474 million of cash flow from operations. We have spent $84 million on capital expenditures and returned $489 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The total number of shares repurchased to date under this program represents approximately 3% of shares outstanding. We are planning for cash flow to remain strong for the foreseeable future. "Orders increased sequentially during the second quarter and were particularly strong in April. Cancellations declined in the second quarter to the lowest levels in the most recent four quarters. At the end of the second quarter, our backlog of products requested for shipment during the third quarter increased by 4% compared to the backlog at the end of first quarter." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "We continue to believe we are in the early stages of a gradual recovery after six months of inventory corrections at many of our customers worldwide. Demand in many of our end markets is good, with particular strength in the consumer market and across the industrial end markets, which represent tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our converter, amplifier, and general-purpose DSP products have resumed growth. Wireless handset and ATE products, which were responsible for a large portion of our sales decline for the past few quarters, appear to be stabilizing. Our lead times are short and we intend to keep them short to minimize order volatility throughout the cycle. "While it is difficult to plan at this stage of the business cycle, based on our opening backlog, our turns order estimates, and assuming normal seasonality, we are planning for third quarter revenue to be flat to up 3% sequentially. "We are planning for third quarter gross margins to improve toward 58%, depending on product mix. We are planning for inventory to remain approximately flat in the third quarter. We are also planning to hold operating expenses in the third quarter relatively flat to the second quarter levels. This should produce diluted EPS in the range of $0.31 to $ 0.33 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005."
