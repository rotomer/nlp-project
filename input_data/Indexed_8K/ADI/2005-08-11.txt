Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for Third Quarter of Fiscal 2005 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 11, 2005--Analog Devices (NYSE:ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue for the fiscal third quarter, which ended July 30, 2005, was $582.4 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.32. Net income increased to $121.4 million or 21% of sales for the third quarter, up 3% from $117.6 million in the second quarter. ADI also announced that the company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per outstanding share of common stock for the third quarter. The dividend is payable on September 14, 2005 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on August 26, 2005. According to Mr. Jerald Fishman, President and CEO, "Revenue declined 3.5% compared to the immediately prior quarter, primarily due to declines in sales of DSP-based products sold to wireless handset customers in Asia. Revenue from analog products was about even with the immediately prior quarter, after growing sequentially by 6% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, analog product revenue totaled 84% of sales. "Gross margins increased to 58.1% for the third quarter, 70 basis points higher than the immediately prior quarter, primarily due to a favorable mix of high margin product sales and the benefit of product cost reductions achieved over recent quarters." "Operating expenses declined approximately 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter. The improvement in gross margins combined with the decline in operating expenses resulted in an operating profit margin of 23.1% of sales, up from 22.2% recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2005." Summarizing the third quarter results by end market, Mr. Fishman said, "Sales to medical, defense and industrial instrumentation customers increased in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter, but were offset by declines in sales to automatic test equipment (ATE) and automotive customers. Overall, the industrial markets totaled approximately 41% of sales in the third quarter. The computer market had the strongest sequential growth in the third quarter and was approximately 16% of sales. Our revenue from consumer customers also increased sequentially and represented 16% of sales in the third quarter. The communications market was generally weak due to lower sales of products used in wireless and broadband applications. Communications customers represented approximately 27% of sales in the third quarter." "On a geographic basis, third quarter revenue compared to the second quarter grew in Japan, was approximately flat in North America, and declined in the other regions of the world," explained Mr. Fishman. "As a result, approximately 20% of sales were in Japan, 26% of sales in North America, 22% of sales in Europe, and 32% of sales were in China and the rest of Asia." Turning to the balance sheet, Mr. Fishman explained, "Our balance sheet continued to strengthen in the third quarter. Inventories declined sequentially by $5 million and days sales in accounts receivable decreased to 46 days compared to 48 days in the immediately prior quarter. "Cash flow from operations totaled $180 million or 31% of sales. In the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $19 million and dividend payments totaled $37 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased by $167 million to $2.78 billion at the end of the third quarter. "Orders for shipment in the next 13 weeks increased sequentially, with particular strength in July, and were above third quarter revenue levels. Our backlog from both OEM customers and distributors for shipment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 grew to $341 million, up 11% from $306 million in the second quarter." Regarding the near term plan, Mr. Fishman said, "We continue to believe that overall, we are in a gradual recovery that began six months ago. Good order trends, higher backlog at the start of the quarter, and the beginning of what is typically a seasonally strong period for consumer-oriented products leads us to plan for sequential revenue growth of 1% to 4%. Depending on the mix of analog and DSP product sales, our gross margins for the fourth quarter are planned to improve modestly and we are planning for operating expenses to be up slightly on a dollar basis. As a result, our plan for the fourth quarter is for EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.34."
