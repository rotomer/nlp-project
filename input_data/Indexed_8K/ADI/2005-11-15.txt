EXHIBIT 99.1 Analog Devices Reports Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2005; Board of Directors increases dividend to $0.12 per share for the quarter Business Editors/Technology Editors NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2005--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $622 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, 7% above the immediately prior quarter and a decrease of 2% compared to the same quarter one year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $0.18 for the fourth quarter, compared to $0.34 for the same period one year ago and $0.32 for the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The fourth quarter results were reduced by $0.18 associated with the previously announced restructuring charges and the repatriation of foreign earnings. The restructuring charge of $31.5 million impacted EPS by $0.05 and the additional tax expense of $49 million impacted EPS by $0.13. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 of $0.12 per outstanding share of common stock, compared to $0.10 declared in the previous quarter. The dividend will be paid on December 14, 2005 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on November 25, 2005. Revenue for fiscal year 2005, which ended October 29, 2005, totaled $2.39 billion, a decline of 9% compared to fiscal year 2004. Compared to fiscal 2004 diluted EPS of $1.45, fiscal 2005 diluted EPS was $1.08, which was reduced by $0.18 due to the restructuring charges and the additional tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. "The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 turned out to be a very strong quarter for ADI, with revenue growing 7% sequentially, well above the level planned for the quarter," said Jerald G. Fishman, president and CEO of Analog Devices, Inc. "Our strongest sequential revenue growth came from the communications market, and in particular, from cellular telephones and from networking applications. In the fourth quarter, communications applications grew approximately 18% compared to the immediately prior quarter and represented 30% of sales. "We also enjoyed continuing strength from sales to consumer customers in applications areas such as digital cameras and advanced televisions, both areas where we are well-positioned with the market share leaders. In the fourth quarter, 16% of sales were to consumer customers and revenue from this end market grew 10% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2005. "Revenue from computer customers increased by 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter. Computer customers represented approximately 15% of sales in the fourth quarter. "Revenue from our broad base of industrial customers, representing factory automation, medical instrumentation, defense and security systems, as well as automotive electronics, was approximately flat for the fourth quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter and totaled approximately 39% of sales." In the fourth quarter, analog product revenue increased 3% from the immediately prior quarter, increased 1% compared to the same period one year ago, and represented 81% of total sales. For the fiscal year 2005, revenue from analog products declined 7% year-over-year, after growing 31% in fiscal year 2004 and 16% in fiscal year 2003. Converter products, ADI's largest analog product category, represented 44% of total ADI sales in the fourth quarter as revenue increased 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter and 9% compared to the same period one year ago. For the fiscal year 2005, revenue from converter products was slightly lower than the previous year, after growing 31% in fiscal year 2004 and 25% in fiscal year 2003. DSP product revenue for the fourth quarter increased 26% from the immediately prior quarter, declined 11% compared to the same period one year ago, and represented 19% of sales. Revenue from general-purpose DSP products, which are included in DSP product revenue, represented approximately 7% of total ADI sales in the fourth quarter. General-purpose DSP product revenue, which is derived from a broad base of customers across many diverse applications, grew 2% in the fourth quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter and 13% compared to the same period one year ago. For fiscal year 2005, revenue from all DSP products declined 18% year-over-year, after growing 21% in fiscal year 2004 and 35% in fiscal year 2003. Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 58.3%, compared to 58.1% in the immediately prior quarter. Operating profits for the fourth quarter totaled $123 million or approximately 20% of sales, after including $31.5 million of restructuring-related expense, which is equivalent to approximately 5% of sales. "Cash flow was very strong in the fourth quarter, with cash flow from operations totaling $200 million or approximately 32% of sales," said Mr. Fishman. "During the quarter, we spent $21 million on capital expenditures and we returned $278 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 6.7 million shares of ADI common stock for $241 million and by paying $37 million in cash dividends." In the fourth quarter, inventory declined sequentially by approximately $20 million, resulting in days cost of sales in inventory declining to 115 days. Accounts receivable balances remained under good control. Days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days for the fourth quarter. According to Mr. Fishman, "Orders were strong in the fourth quarter in every region of the world with the exception of Europe where orders declined sequentially. Turns orders (orders booked and shipped during the quarter) remained high and comprised approximately 50% of sales for the fourth quarter. Inventory levels declined in distribution. This is all consistent with our continuing short lead times and the high turns environment in which we are still operating." Regarding the near-term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "As we enter 2006, we are planning for a good year. Our 13-week backlog at the beginning of the first quarter is 4% higher than last quarter. Due to the normal seasonality in the consumer and industrial markets, we are planning for first quarter revenue to be approximately equal to fourth quarter levels and for first quarter EPS to be approximately $0.31, which is reduced by approximately $0.05 of previously announced restructuring-related expense and stock-based compensation expense. The planned $7.7 million of restructuring-related expense is estimated to impact EPS by $0.01 and the estimated $20 million of stock-based compensation expense is expected to impact EPS by $0.04." ADI will begin expensing stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2006. The company has provided a table at http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=95455&p=irol-irHome which includes estimates of the impact of stock-based compensation and the impact of previously announced restructuring-related expenses on the company's 2006 quarterly financial statements. Regarding the balance of fiscal year 2006, Mr. Fishman said, "We are planning for sequential revenue growth to resume in the second quarter and for gross margins to continue to improve throughout the year as we increase the utilization of our internal wafer fabs. We intend to keep expenses tightly constrained, with most increases tied directly to improving financial performance. In aggregate, we are planning to hold the rate of expense growth well below the rate of sales growth and thereby continue to increase operating profits by a high percentage of the planned sales growth. We believe that throughout 2006 the breadth of our high performance analog and DSP technology and the diversity of applications where this technology helps differentiate our customers' end systems will continue to produce excellent results for our shareholders."
