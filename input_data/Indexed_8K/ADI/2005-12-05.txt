Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Analog Devices Inc.

The Bonus Plan is based on the Company's operating profit before taxes ("OPBT") as a percentage of the Company's fiscal quarter sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, as previously disclosed, the Company recorded special charges related to restructuring actions.
