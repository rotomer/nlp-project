Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On January 24, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Analog Devices Inc. (the "Company") approved the terms of an Executive Performance Bonus Plan for fiscal year 2006 (the "Executive Bonus Plan"). All Named Executive Officers and other senior management approved by the Compensation Committee will participate in the Executive Bonus Plan. The payments under the Executive Bonus Plan are calculated based on the following factors: 1. Eligible Earnings - base pay during the bonus period. 2. Operating Profit Before Tax as a Percentage of Revenue for the Bonus Period - this can be adjusted by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion based on special items including but not limited to: stock option expense; asset write-downs; litigation; claim judgments; settlements; changes in accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; and any extraordinary non-recurring items. The Bonus Payout Factor ranges from zero to three. 3. Individual's Bonus Target Percentage of Salary - this is a percentage of an individual's Eligible Earnings. The Individual's Bonus Target Percentage of Salary for our executive officers is determined individually for each executive officer by the Compensation Committee. They currently range from 25% to 120%. The bonus calculated by multiplying items one through three above is then subject to the following potential adjustments numbered four through six: 4. Evaluation of Individual's Performance - this can reduce, but not increase, the bonus calculated through item number three above by as much as 50% based on an evaluation of the executive's individual performance. This evaluation will be performed by the CEO for all of our executive officers, except for the CEO's evaluation, which will be performed by the Compensation Committee. 5. Performance of the Company Relative to Competitors - this can increase the bonus calculated through item number four by 25% based on the Company's sales growth during the bonus period relative to the sales growth of a group of peer companies selected by the Compensation Committee. 6. Analog's EPS Relative to the Plan for the Year - this can increase the bonus calculated through item number four by 25% if Analog's annual fiscal year 2006 diluted EPS is equal to or exceeds the plan established at the beginning of the year. For purposes of the Executive Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee can, at its sole discretion, adjust diluted EPS to exclude certain items including but not limited to: stock option expense; asset write-downs; litigation; claim judgments; settlements; changes in accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; and any extraordinary non-recurring items. Distributions, if any, under the Executive Bonus Plan will be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter and paid out in approximately June 2006 and December 2006 based on local payroll cycles. Item numbers four, five and six are only assessed and/or calculated annually at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, the bonus paid in June 2006 will be calculated by multiplying the first three items. Any adjustment for numbers four, five and six will be assessed and calculated after the fiscal year end and applied to the December bonus payment.
