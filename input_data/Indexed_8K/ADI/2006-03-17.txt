Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On March 14, 2006, Analog Devices, Inc. (the "Company") held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, where the Company's shareholders approved the Company's 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan had been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") on January 23, 2006, subject to shareholder approval, and provides for the grant of up to 15,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, plus such number of additional shares that were subject to outstanding options under the Company's 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "1998 Plan") and the 2001 Broad-based Stock Option Plan (the "2001 Plan") as of January 23, 2006 that are subsequently terminated or expire without being exercised. The Company will not grant further options under the 1998 Plan or the 2001 Plan.
     The full text of the Plan was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2006 as an Appendix to the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement and is incorporated herein by reference. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Plan.
     Subject to the limitations contained therein, the Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Code, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. Employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted awards under the Plan. No award may be made under the Plan after March 13, 2016, but awards previously granted may extend beyond that date. The Plan is administered by the Board, which also has authority to interpret the terms of the Plan. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board authority to administer certain aspects of the Plan, including the granting of options to executive officers. The Board, or if and to the extent authorized by the Board, the Compensation Committee selects the recipients of awards under the Plan and determines (i) the number of shares of common stock covered by options and the dates upon which such options become exercisable, (ii) the exercise price of options (which may not be less than 100% of fair market value of our common stock), (iii) the duration of options (which may not exceed 10 years) and (iv) the number of shares of common stock subject to any SAR, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award or other stock-based awards and the terms and conditions of such awards, including, if applicable, conditions for forfeiture or repurchase, the issue price, the grant or exercise price (which in the case of SARs may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock) and the repurchase price.

NORWOOD, Mass.(BUSINESS WIRE)March 14, 2006
- Board declares $0.16 cash dividend payable on June 14, 2006.
The Analog Devices, Inc.

The board also authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of ADI's common stock.
"Today's cash dividend and the stock repurchase announcements signal our confidence in the long term performance of our business model and our commitment to continuously improve the rate of return for our shareholders," said Ray Stata, Chairman of the Board.
ADI's board declared the first quarterly cash dividend in November of 2003 and has raised the dividend three times since then. As a result, a total of $238 million in dividends have been paid to shareholders. The board today increased the regular quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share, commencing with the dividend to be paid on June 14, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2006. Quarterly dividends will continue at $0.16 per share, subject to declaration or change by the board.
