Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Results for Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI) -- Board of Directors increases quarterly dividend to $0.16 from $0.12 per share; -- Financial results for the second quarter and guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 will be discussed via conference call today at 4:30 pm. Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $643.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2006, an increase of 7% compared to the same period one year ago and an increase of 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $145.8 million for the second quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.39 for the second quarter. The GAAP results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 include the following items: a gain of $13 million related to the previously-announced sale of the digital signal processing (DSP)-based digital subscriber line (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and network processor product line; expenses of $6 million included in cost of sales and related to previously-announced restructuring actions; and $17 million of non-cash stock option expense. These items reduced diluted EPS by $0.02 in the second quarter. The cash dividend was increased to $0.16 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 14, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 26, 2006. This is an increase from the $0.12 dividend paid in March of 2006. "The second quarter was a good quarter for ADI, led by strong growth in sales to our industrial instrumentation, consumer electronics, and wireless infrastructure customers," said Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and chief executive officer. "Data converter, amplifier, and general-purpose DSP products were the fastest-growing product categories compared to the immediately prior quarter." Profit Margins Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 was $380.7 million, or 59.1% of sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, gross margin was reduced by $6.9 million, or 1.1% of sales, as a result of stock option expense and previously announced manufacturing restructuring-related expense. Operating profits for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 totaled $151.4 million, or approximately 23.5% of sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2006, operating profits were reduced by $22.8 million, as a result of stock option expense and previously announced restructuring-related expense. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Cash flow from operations totaled $205.1 million, or approximately 32% of sales, for the second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $28.8 million. The company repurchased approximately 6.2 million shares of ADI common stock for $237.7 million and paid $44.2 million in cash dividends. Cash and short term investments totaled approximately $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. In the second quarter, inventory increased by approximately $21.6 million compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 125 days at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to 124 days one year ago and 118 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. The company increased inventory in preparation for the planned to shutdown of its California wafer fabrication facility and to fulfill planned sales growth for the third quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable were 51 days at the end of the second quarter, compared to 49 days one year ago and 47 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to a disproportionate amount of shipments in the last month of the quarter as supply issues earlier in the quarter were resolved. Revenue Analysis By Product During the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, analog products totaled 84% of sales and DSP products totaled 16% of sales. Revenue from analog products grew 11% compared to the same period one year ago and 5% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Data converter product sales grew 8%, amplifier sales grew 9%, and other analog product sales declined 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue from each of these analog product categories increased on a year-over-year basis. Revenue from DSP products declined 10% compared to the same period one year ago and 4% compared to the immediately prior quarter due primarily to the previously announced sale of the DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. General-purpose DSP product sales grew 6% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue Analysis By End Market Revenue from both the industrial and consumer end markets grew sequentially and year-over-year. Revenue from the industrial end market, which includes factory automation, scientific and medical instrumentation, semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE), defense electronics, and automotive applications, totaled approximately 42% of sales in the second quarter. Revenue from the consumer end market totaled approximately 17% of sales in the second quarter. Within the communications end market, revenue from wireless infrastructure customers grew significantly compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue from wireless handset customers also grew while revenue from networking customers declined, as expected, due to the previously announced sale of the DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line. Overall, revenue from the communications end markets totaled approximately 29% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. In line with the broader computer industry trends, revenue from customers in the computer end market declined during the quarter and was approximately 12% of sales. Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2006 Regarding the near term outlook, Mr. Fishman said, "Orders and backlog increased significantly during the second quarter. Our OEM customers and our distributors are signaling significant increases in demand for our analog and DSP products. In aggregate, we are planning for revenue in the range of $675 million to $685 million." ADI is planning for gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately the same as the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Operating expenses are planned to increase a few percent compared to the second quarter, primarily due to increased profit sharing and commissions as sales and operating margin expand. Diluted EPS is planned to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.39 for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, which includes approximately $0.06 for stock option expenses, previously-announced restructuring expenses, and expenses associated with a previously-announced acquisition. The plan for third quarter is for days sales in accounts receivable to decline to approximately 48 days. Days cost of sales in inventory is planned to decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
