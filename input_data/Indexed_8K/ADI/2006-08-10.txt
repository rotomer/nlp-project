Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Results for Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 10, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI): -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share; -- Financial results for the third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 will be discussed via conference call today at 4:30 pm. Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $663.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, an increase of approximately 14% compared to the same period one year ago and an increase of approximately 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $144.7 million for the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.39 for the third quarter. The GAAP results for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 include the following items: expenses of $5.7 million included in cost of sales related to previously-announced restructuring actions; expenses of $6.2 million included in operating expenses related to previously-announced acquisitions; $19 million of non-cash stock option expenses; and $16.8 million of tax benefits. In total, these items reduced diluted EPS by $0.04 in the third quarter. Excluding these items, diluted EPS was $0.43 in the third quarter. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.16 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on September 13, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 25, 2006. "Revenue from our broad base of industrial customers continued to be strong in the third quarter, increasing 16% year-over-year and 3% sequentially," said Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and chief executive officer. "Revenue from communications customers increased 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Within communications, revenue from wireless base station customers was particularly strong, while revenue from wireless handset customers was approximately equal to the immediately prior quarter. In the third quarter, revenue from consumer customers increased 14% year-over-year and 3% sequentially while revenue from computer customers declined compared to the immediately prior quarter."

In the third quarter of fiscal 2006, gross margin was reduced by $8.7 million, or 1.3% of sales, as a result of stock option expense and previously announced manufacturing restructuring-related expense. Excluding these items, gross margin for the third quarter was 60.1% of sales. Operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 totaled $148.9 million, or approximately 22.4% of sales.

Balance Sheet Cash and short term investments totaled approximately $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. In the third quarter, inventory increased by approximately $18 million compared to the immediately prior quarter. Approximately $9 million of the inventory increase was planned as part of the closure of the company's wafer manufacturing facility in Sunnyvale, California, which is on schedule to be shutdown in October of 2006.
