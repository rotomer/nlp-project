Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Revises Revenue Outlook for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI) announced today that it estimates revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, ending October 28, 2006, will be approximately $640 to $645 million, which is approximately 3% below the third quarter of fiscal 2006 revenue of $663.7 million. The Company's previous outlook for fourth quarter revenue was announced on August 10, 2006, and at that time, ADI estimated fourth quarter revenue would be approximately flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The sequential decline in revenue for the fourth quarter, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, is primarily due to a decline in revenue from cellular handset customers. ADI believes that during the fourth quarter these customers depleted inventory they had accumulated during the immediately prior quarter. ADI expects revenue from customers in all other end markets in the aggregate will be up slightly in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, as a result of growth in sales to the broad base of high-performance analog and general-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) customers. ADI's fourth quarter financial release and conference call are scheduled for Tuesday, November 14, 2006, at which time management will discuss results in more detail and provide the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
