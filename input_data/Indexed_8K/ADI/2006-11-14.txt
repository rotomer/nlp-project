Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2006 Financial Results NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2006--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI): -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share; -- Financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will be discussed via conference call today at 4:30 pm. Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced revenue of $644.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, which ended October 28, 2006, an increase of approximately 4% compared to the same period one year ago and a decrease of approximately 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. For the year, revenue was $2.57 billion, an increase of approximately 8% compared to fiscal 2005. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) was $138.4 million for the fourth quarter, or 21.5% of sales, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.39. For fiscal year 2006, GAAP net income was $549.5 million, or 21.4% of sales, and diluted EPS was $1.48. Non-GAAP net income was $139.4 million for the fourth quarter, or 21.6% of sales, and diluted EPS was $0.39. For fiscal year 2006, non-GAAP net income was $591.3 million, or 23% of sales, and diluted EPS was $1.59. The non-GAAP operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 exclude the following items: $17.3 million of non-cash stock option expenses associated with the adoption of FAS123R; expenses of $3.6 million related to restructuring actions; expenses of $19.1 million related to previously-announced acquisitions; and $26.7 million of tax benefits which resulted from the completion of a tax examination. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of $0.16 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 13, 2006 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on November 24, 2006. "Revenue from consumer customers grew 13% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2006. This revenue growth was driven by strong sales of digital cameras, home entertainment systems, and new video game consoles where ADI technology continues to enable new sight, sound, and other user experiences in our customers' products," said Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and chief executive officer. "Revenue from computer customers also increased sequentially during the quarter, while revenue from our broad base of industrial customers was approximately flat sequentially. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, revenue from communications customers declined 18% compared to the immediately prior quarter, primarily as a result of lower revenue from wireless handset customers." "For fiscal year 2006, analog product revenue climbed to over $2 billion primarily due to strong growth in converters and amplifiers. Overall, in fiscal 2006, our analog product sales grew 13% year-to-year," said Mr. Fishman. "While revenue from general-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) products grew 10% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, this increase was offset by declines in revenue from application-specific DSP products." Profit Margins Under GAAP, gross margin was $374.6 million, or 58.1% of sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and $1.51 billion, or 58.5% of sales, for fiscal year 2006. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was $382.5 million, or 59.4% of sales, compared to 58.3% of sales in the same period one year ago and 60.1% of sales in the immediately prior quarter. For fiscal year 2006, non-GAAP gross margin was $1.54 billion, or 59.7% of sales, compared to 57.9% of sales in fiscal 2005. The increase from year to year was primarily related to increased factory utilization and the result of increased sales of higher margin products in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Under GAAP, operating profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 totaled $119.3 million, or approximately 18.5% of sales. For the year, GAAP operating profit was $551.8 million, or approximately 21.4% of sales. Non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter was $159.4 million, or 24.7% of sales, compared to 24.8% of sales in the same period one year ago and 27.1% of sales in the immediately prior quarter. The sequential decline in non-GAAP operating profit was primarily due to lower revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, as compared to the immediately prior quarter. For the year, non-GAAP operating profit was $673.2 million, or 26.2% of sales, compared to 22.9% of sales in fiscal year 2005. Uses of Cash Capital expenditures totaled $41.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, or 6.5% of sales. For the year, capital expenditures totaled $129.3 million, or 5% of sales. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, ADI paid $55.6 million in cash dividends. For the year, dividend payments to shareholders totaled $201.5 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the company repurchased approximately 11.9 million shares of ADI common stock for $357.0 million. During the 2006 fiscal year, the company repurchased approximately 30.7 million shares of ADI common stock, or 9% of shares outstanding, for $1.03 billion. ADI has repurchased a cumulative total of approximately 14% of shares outstanding for $1.69 billion under the $2 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized by the Board of Directors. Balance Sheet Cash and short term investments totaled approximately $2.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, inventory increased by approximately $1.2 million compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 128 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to 126 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable were 47 days at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to 49 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. Revenue Analysis by Product During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, revenue from analog products totaled 84% of sales and revenue from DSP products totaled 16% of sales. During the fourth quarter, revenue from analog products grew 14% compared to the same period one year ago and 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Compared to the same period one year ago, data converter product sales grew 10%, amplifier product sales grew 22%, power management product sales grew 3%, and other analog product sales grew 27%. Compared to the immediately prior quarter, data converter product sales declined 1%, primarily due to more moderate sales to base station applications after very strong growth in the prior quarter and also due to continued weakness in the semiconductor automatic test equipment market. Amplifier product sales and power management product sales each grew 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Other analog product sales grew 12% compared to the immediately prior quarter due to increased demand for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) products and the acquisition of the Integrant RF tuner product line. During the fourth quarter, revenue from DSP products declined 31% compared to the same period one year ago and declined 21% compared to the immediately prior quarter. DSP product sales were significantly impacted by the divesture during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of the DSP-based digital subscriber line (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) product line and also by an inventory correction among customers of our DSP-based wireless chipset products for cellular handsets. Approximately 9% of the Company's sales in the fourth quarter were from general-purpose DSP products, which grew 15% compared to the same period one year ago and 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. For the year, revenue from analog products grew 13%. Approximately 61% of sales in fiscal 2006 were attributed to converters and amplifiers, which, compared to the previous year, grew 10% and 19%, respectively. DSP product sales during fiscal year 2006 declined 11% compared to fiscal year 2005, primarily due to the divestiture during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of the DSP-based DSL ASIC product line which had $55 million in revenue in 2005 and $14 million in revenue in 2006. Excluding this product line, DSP product sales declined approximately 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, as the 10% annual revenue growth of general-purpose DSP products was offset by declines in application-specific DSP product revenue. We have provided a four year summary of our revenue by product type and end market on the investor relations page of our website to help investors better understand the long term trends in our business. Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2007 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. These statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date hereof. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. Product sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 are planned to be approximately $635 to $670 million. This includes an additional week of operations as the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will have a total of 14 weeks. In addition, revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will include a $35 million one-time, non-recurring payment received by the Company on November 9, 2006 in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. Total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to range from $670 to $705 million. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be approximately 60% to 60.5% of sales. Due primarily to the fact that the one-time $35 million payment will not have any cost of sales associated with it, GAAP gross margin is planned to be approximately 61.2% to 61.6% of sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses are planned to increase by approximately $11 million primarily as a result of expenses associated with the additional week of operations within the first quarter of fiscal 2007. GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.36 to $0.42 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which includes approximately $0.02 of various net expenses detailed in the Summary of Estimated Non-GAAP Data for the First Quarter Ending February 3, 2007 Table provided with this release. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be approximately $0.38 to $0.44 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures, for revenue, net income, diluted EPS, gross margin and operating income, which exclude the effects of charges related to stock-based compensation, restructuring related expenses, acquisition related expenses, income tax benefits associated with the settlement of an IRS examination, gain on the sale of a product line, the tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings, and non-recurring revenue associated with the license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Analog Devices believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share data, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. The Company's usage of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in this release. The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-operational nature. The company believes that the exclusion of these items provides an enhanced understanding to investors of the underlying baseline operating results and trends of the company's business. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the company's operating performance. As described above, Analog Devices excludes the following items from our non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation related to employee stock options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. Further, as we implemented FAS 123R beginning in fiscal 2006, we believe it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of FAS 123R to our results of operations. Restructuring Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Gain on the Sale of a Product Line. We realized a gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. This amount arose from prior activities and has no direct correlation to the ongoing business operations. Tax Benefit Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. The United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company has agreed to accept this report and has filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit have resulted in an income tax benefit. We exclude these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they are not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Tax Expense Associated with the Repatriation of Foreign Earnings. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. We exclude this item from our non-GAAP results because it was a temporary incentive and is not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment will increase revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.

The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we restate the product categories for all prior periods in order to ensure the trends by product category continue to be meaningful.
