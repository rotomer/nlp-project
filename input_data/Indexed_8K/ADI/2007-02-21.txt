Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007 -- Q1 Revenue: $692 million, including $35 million technology license fee -- Q1 Diluted EPS: $0.44 GAAP; $0.40 non-GAAP -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share -- Financial results for the first quarter and guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 will be discussed via conference call today at 5:00 pm Business Editors NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 21, 2007--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended February 3, 2007. The first quarter of fiscal year 2007 was a 14-week quarter, as compared to the typical 13-week quarter, because ADI follows a 52-week (or 364-day) fiscal calendar which results in an additional week approximately every seventh year. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $692 million, which included $657 million of product revenue and $35 million of revenue from a one-time technology license. Product revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased approximately 6% compared to the same period one year ago and increased approximately 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), was $153 million, or 22% of total revenue, compared to $121 million for the same period one year ago and $138 million for the immediately prior quarter. The operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 include the following items: -- $35 million of revenue from a one-time technology license fee -- $8 million of non-operating income from the sale of an investment -- $20 million of non-cash stock option expenses -- $5.2 million of expenses related to restructuring actions -- $3.1 million of expenses related to previously-announced acquisitions -- An adjustment to the provision for taxes to reflect the tax effect of these items -- $10 million of tax savings associated with the reinstatement of the federal research and development (R&D) tax credit Together these items increased diluted EPS by $0.04. A reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in a table below. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $0.44, compared to $0.32 for the same period one year ago and $0.39 for the immediately prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $0.40, compared to $0.37 for the same period one year ago and $0.39 for the immediately prior quarter. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock, an increase of $0.02 from the dividend paid on December 13, 2006. The dividend will be paid on March 28, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2007. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $417 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was $387 million, or 59.0% of product revenue, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 59.2% of product revenue in the same period one year ago and 59.4% of product revenue in the immediately prior quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin declined slightly compared to the immediately prior quarter primarily as a result of higher sales of products for consumer electronics and cellular handset applications, which carry relatively lower gross margin. Non-GAAP gross margin was also constrained by continued low utilization rates in ADI factories. Operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, totaled $163 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $156 million, or 23.8% of product revenue, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 25.7% of product revenue in the same period one year ago and 24.7% of product revenue in the immediately prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit declined compared to the immediately prior quarter primarily as a result of higher operating expenses associated with an additional week of expenses in the 14-week first quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $208 million, or 30.1% of total revenue, compared to $175 million, or 28.2% of total revenue, in the same period one year ago and compared to $167 million, or 25.9% of total revenue, in the immediately prior quarter. -- Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 totaled $38 million. -- Cash dividends paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $54.7 million. -- Share repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 of approximately 10.1 million shares of ADI common stock (approximately 3% of total shares outstanding) totaled $333 million. -- The share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors had approximately $979 million remaining at the end of the first quarter of 2007. Balance Sheet -- Cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled approximately $1.95 billion. -- Inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter, consistent with the increase in product revenue over the same period. -- Accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 5% compared to accounts receivable at the end of the immediately prior quarter. A high rate of shipments in the last month of the first quarter was the primary reason for the increase. Revenue Analysis By End Market and By Product Category Revenue analysis is based on product revenue of $657 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which excludes the one-time $35 million technology license fee. Revenue Analysis By End Market -- Revenue from customers in the industrial market represented approximately 44% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the industrial market, which includes factory automation, medical and scientific instrumentation, automotive, security, and defense applications, increased by 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter and increased by 14% compared to the same period one year ago. Comparing the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to the immediately prior quarter, revenue from automotive and defense applications increased, while other areas of the industrial market were approximately flat. -- Revenue from customers in the communications market represented approximately 26% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the communications market increased by 7% compared to the immediately prior quarter and declined by 9% compared to the same period one year ago. Comparing the first quarter of fiscal 2007 to the immediately prior quarter, revenue from base station and wireless handset applications increased, while revenue from other areas of the communications market was approximately flat or decreased. -- Revenue from customers in the consumer market represented approximately 20% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the consumer market increased by 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter and increased by 35% compared to the same period one year ago primarily as a result of increased sales to manufacturers of digital home applications, including flat screen televisions and new video game controllers. -- Revenue from customers in the computer market represented approximately 10% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from the computer market declined by 14% compared to the immediately prior quarter and declined by 20% compared to the same period one year ago primarily as a result of ADI's strategy to refocus power management products on portable applications and also due to a generally weak computer market in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue Analysis By Product Category Revenue from analog products totaled approximately $547 million, or 83% of product revenue, an increase of 1% compared to the immediately prior quarter and an increase of 13% compared to the same period one year ago. -- During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, revenue from converter and amplifier products represented approximately 61% of product revenue and, compared to the immediately prior quarter, revenue from converter and amplifier products declined slightly. Compared to the same period one year ago, revenue from converter and amplifier products increased by 13% and 14%, respectively. -- Revenue from other analog products such as micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) products and radio frequency (RF) integrated circuits increased significantly in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to both the immediately prior quarter and the same period one year ago. Revenue from digital signal processing (DSP) products totaled approximately $110 million, or 17% of product revenue, an increase of 9% compared to the immediately prior quarter and a decrease of 20% compared to the same period one year ago. A significant portion of the year-to-year decline was due to the divestiture of the DSP-based digital subscriber line (DSL) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and network processor product line. -- Compared to the immediately prior quarter, DSP wireless chipset revenue increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 after declining in the prior quarter when customers' inventory corrections negatively impacted DSP product revenue. DSP wireless chipset revenue comprised 7% of product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. -- During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, revenue from general-purpose DSP products represented 9% of product revenue, was approximately flat compared to the immediately prior quarter and increased by 18% compared to the same period one year ago. Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2007 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. "Orders from customers and distributors began strengthening in January and have continued to be strong, which we believe is a positive sign of improving industry conditions," said Jerald G. Fishman, ADI's president and chief executive officer. "Therefore, we are planning for good growth in our second fiscal quarter." -- Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be approximately $640 to $670 million. -- Non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 are planned to be approximately 58.5% to 59% of revenue. -- Operating expenses are planned to increase slightly in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of annual salary increases that take effect in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 and increased R&D spending on new analog products. -- Diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, is planned to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.36. Diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to include approximately $0.06 of various net expenses detailed in the Summary of Estimated Stock-based Compensation, Restructuring- and Acquisition-Related Expenses for the Second Quarter Ending May 5, 2007 table provided with this release. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be $0.37 to $0.42. Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the effects of charges related to non-recurring revenue associated with the license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party, gain on the sale of an investment, stock-based compensation, restructuring-related expenses, acquisition-related expenses, and an adjustment to the provision for taxes to reflect the tax effect of these items. These non-GAAP measures also exclude the income tax savings associated with the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit and the tax savings associated with an IRS tax settlement. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance. The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. The Company believes that the exclusion of these items provides an enhanced understanding to investors of the underlying baseline operating results and trends of the Company's business. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP are provided in this release. As described above, Analog Devices excludes the following items from our non-GAAP measures: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Gain on Sale of Investment. We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results. Stock-based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. The United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) has completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company has agreed to accept this report and has filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit have resulted in an income tax savings. We excluded these income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Analog Devices believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations, and provides our investors with some of the financial measures we use to manage our business. The Company's usage of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods. Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance. Non-GAAP financial information excludes the effects of: stock-based compensation expense related to the adoption of FAS123R, restructuring-related expense, acquisition-related expense, a one-time payment associated with the licensing of intellectual property, gain on sale of an investment, the impact of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and the tax savings associated with an IRS tax settlement. The provision for taxes has been adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect the tax effect of these items.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each end market.

The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing, or the underlying trends of results within each product category.
