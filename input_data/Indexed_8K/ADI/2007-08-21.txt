Exhibit 99.1 Analog Devices Announces Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007 -- Q3 Revenue: $680 million, 3% annual growth, 2% sequential growth -- Q3 Diluted EPS: $0.37 GAAP; $0.41 non-GAAP -- Company repurchased $632 million of ADI common stock during Q3 -- Board of Directors declares quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share -- Financial results for the third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 will be discussed via conference call today at 5:00 pm NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 21, 2007--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended August 4, 2007. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 increased to $680 million, an increase of approximately 3% compared to the same period one year ago and 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. "The third quarter was another solid quarter for ADI, turning out largely as we had planned in terms of our revenue growth, product sales mix, and operating expenses," said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Order rates remained strong during the third quarter in both the OEM and distribution channels." Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), was $120 million, or 18% of sales, compared to $145 million for the same period one year ago and $125 million for the immediately prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $0.37, compared to $0.39 for the same period one year ago and $0.37 for the immediately prior quarter. The results for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 include the following items: -- $17.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses related to employee stock options, or $0.037 on a diluted earnings per share (EPS) basis. -- $2.8 million of expenses related to previously announced acquisitions, or $0.006 on a diluted EPS basis. -- The provision for taxes includes the tax effect of these items. Together these items represented the $0.04 difference between GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.41. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in a table below. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, was $389 million, or 57.1% of sales. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, gross margin was reduced by $4.5 million, or 0.7% of sales, as a result of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expense. Gross margin as a percentage of sales was approximately equal to the immediately prior quarter as planned. Inventory declined $10.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the immediately prior quarter. Operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, totaled $138 million, or 20.2% of sales. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, operating profit was reduced by $20 million, or 3.0% of sales, as a result of stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $191 million, or 28% of sales. Capital expenditures for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 totaled $31 million. Cash dividends paid during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $59 million. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock which will be paid on September 19, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2007. Share repurchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 of approximately 16.9 million shares of ADI common stock totaled $632 million and represented approximately 5.2% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the third quarter. -- As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the total shares repurchased under the program authorized by the Board of Directors totaled approximately $3 billion and represented approximately 22.8% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, the start of this repurchase program. -- The share repurchase program had approximately $983 million remaining at the end of the third quarter of 2007. Balance Sheet -- Inventory at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased approximately 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of sales in inventory was 116 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 121 days at the end of last quarter and 126 days a year ago. -- Days sales in accounts receivable was 47 days in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 45 days in the immediately prior quarter. The tables, "Revenue Trends By End Market" and "Revenue Trends By Product," provided below, summarize revenue by end market and by product for the third quarter, the immediately prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. Highlights: -- Analog product revenue, which comprised 84% of total revenue in the third quarter, increased 3% compared to the immediately prior quarter. The sequential revenue growth was driven by the data converter, amplifier, power management, and radio frequency product categories. -- General-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) product revenue, which comprised 8% of total revenue in the third quarter, increased 7% compared to the immediately prior quarter. -- Revenue from the broad based industrial end market comprised 43% of total sales in the third quarter. Revenue from industrial instrumentation and test equipment customers increased compared to the immediately prior quarter, while revenue from other industrial applications declined. Overall, revenue from industrial customers was flat in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter. -- Revenue from communications infrastructure customers increased in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter driven by 13% growth in revenue from basestation and networking equipment customers. -- Revenue from consumer and computer customers increased 3% and 9%, respectively, in the third quarter compared to the immediately prior quarter. Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2007 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. -- Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be in the range of $680 to $710 million. -- Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is planned to be approximately the same as the third quarter. Typically, in the fourth quarter ADI derives a higher percentage of revenue from products used in consumer applications which have relatively lower gross margin than most of the other end markets ADI serves. -- Operating expenses are planned to be flat to slightly higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the immediately prior quarter. -- Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, is planned to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.40. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 is expected to include approximately $0.05 of various net expenses detailed in the Assumptions Used to Estimate Results for the Fourth Quarter Ending November 3, 2007 table provided with this release. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is planned to be $0.41 to $0.45.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Company's business. Our budgets are determined excluding the items listed below and management's performance is assessed using these non-GAAP operating metrics. Management has also established employee and executive profit sharing bonus plans that use non-GAAP operating income as the metric to determine any bonus payout. Economic Substance Behind Management's Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude this and the related tax effects primarily because it is a non-cash expense, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating income: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations.

The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: Stock-Based Compensation Related to Employee Stock Options. These expenses consist of expenses for employee stock options under FAS123R. We exclude these stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Acquisition-Related Expense. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We also incur amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. We exclude these items and the related tax effects primarily because they are non-cash expenses, which we do not consider when evaluating and managing our business operations.

A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006 the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed to accept their report and filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit resulted in an income tax benefit. We excluded these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they were not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company. Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company's use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Management's Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. About Analog Devices, Inc.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.
