The wireless handset baseband chipset & radio transceiver business was accounted for in the fourth quarter as a discontinued operation. Thus, the Company's fourth quarter revenue excluded $50 million from this business. Please refer to the section below titled "Divestitures" for more information. ADI has excluded only one-time or non-recurring items from non-GAAP measures. Commencing in the fourth quarter, we are no longer excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related expense from our non-GAAP measures. The Company has provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in a table below. Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, which ended November 3, 2007. Results for the entire fiscal year are included under the heading, Summary for the Fiscal Year 2007. Revenue Revenue from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 increased to $648.5 million, an increase of approximately 6% compared to the same period one year ago and an increase of approximately 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter excluded $50.3 million from discontinued operations. "The fourth quarter was a solid quarter for ADI," said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. "Revenue and earnings were in line with our expectations for the quarter. We are entering 2008 with a better balanced product portfolio, capable of good growth and strong profit leverage." Diluted EPS of $0.31 Included $0.08 for Restructuring Expense & Tax Adjustments Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, on a non-GAAP basis for continuing operations, was $0.39, compared to $0.35 for the same period one year ago and $0.38 for the immediately prior quarter. The results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 include the following items: -- $25 million charge, or $0.064 on a diluted EPS basis, related to planned operating expense reductions and the decision to transfer wafer production capacity at ADI's Limerick, Ireland manufacturing facility from 6" to 8" technology -- $4.4 million charge, or $0.014 on a diluted EPS basis, which is a one-time tax adjustment related to the IRS examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 Together these items represented the $0.08 difference between GAAP diluted EPS of $0.31 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.39. Fourth Quarter Revenue Summary The tables, "Revenue Trends By End Market" and "Revenue Trends By Product," provided below, summarize revenue by end market and by product for the fourth quarter, the immediately prior quarter and the year-ago quarter, as well as for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Revenue growth during the fourth quarter was highest for consumer products, which grew by 17% compared to the same period one year ago and grew sequentially by 11%. Sequential growth was driven by very strong sales growth from products used in digital cameras and digital TVs. Revenue from consumer products represented 23% of revenue in the fourth quarter. Industrial customer revenue represented 46% of revenue in the fourth quarter, increased 4% compared to the same period one year ago, and was approximately equal to the immediately prior quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue within the industrial category increased for the automotive and the defense end markets, decreased for semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE), and was unchanged for the broad base of industrial customers. Communications customer revenue represented 21% of revenue in the fourth quarter, increased 9% from the same quarter last year, and declined sequentially by 7%. After strong growth last quarter, revenue from base station and networking customers declined sequentially. Computer customer revenue was 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter and declined 8% from the same quarter last year. Revenue from computer customers grew 13% sequentially, in-line with industry trends. By geographic region, revenue for the fourth quarter increased sequentially in Europe by 9%, in North America by 4%, and in Japan by 5%. Revenue decreased in China by 14%, following very strong sequential growth in the prior quarter, and was relatively unchanged in the rest of Asia Pacific. Gross Margin Gross margin from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $379 million, or 58.4% of revenue. Gross margin declined sequentially by 50 basis points due to strong sequential revenue growth from products used in consumer and computer applications, which in aggregate have gross margin below the Company average, and sequential revenue declines from products used in semiconductor automatic test equipment (ATE) and communications base station and networking applications, which have gross margin above the Company average. Operating Profit Operating profit from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $121 million, or 18.7% of revenue. Operating profit was reduced by $25 million, or 3.9% of revenue, as a result of restructuring-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating profit was 22.6% of revenue, which was equal to the prior quarter. Net Cash Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $183 million, or 28.2% of revenue. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 totaled $33 million, or 5% of revenue. Cash Dividend Cash dividends paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled $55 million. On November 26, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per outstanding share of common stock which will be paid on December 26, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2007. Shares Outstanding Decreased 11% Compared to Year-Ago Quarter Share repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 of approximately 8.6 million shares of ADI common stock totaled $318 million and represented approximately 2.8% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the fourth quarter. -- $3.3 billion in share repurchases, representing approximately 95 million shares, or 25.1% of the shares outstanding, have been repurchased since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004. -- The share repurchase program had approximately $665 million in authorization remaining at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Balance Sheet Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased $11 million, or approximately 3%, compared to the immediately prior quarter. Days cost of revenue in inventory was 118 days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 133 days a year ago and 125 days at the end of the immediately prior quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable was 47 days, unchanged from the immediately prior quarter. Days sales in accounts receivable was 46 days at the end of fiscal year 2006. Summary for the Fiscal Year 2007 2007 Product Highlights: -- Product revenue grew 7% in fiscal year 2007 and totaled $2.5 billion. Product revenue excludes the one-time payment of $35 million received in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. -- Analog product revenue represented 90% of product revenue for ADI and increased 9% in fiscal 2007. -- Converter product revenue represented 44% of product revenue and increased 8% for the year. -- Amplifier product revenue represented 22% of product revenue and increased 5% for the year. -- Power management and reference revenue represented 8% of product revenue and declined 6% for the year. Excluding the CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring product line, which is planned to be divested, revenue declined 2% for the year. -- Revenue from other analog products, such as Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Radio Frequency (RF) products, represented 16% of product revenue and increased 27% for the year. -- General-purpose digital signal processing (DSP) product revenue represented 9% of product revenue and increased 4% for the year. 2007 End Market Highlights: -- More than $1 billion in revenue, or 47% of product revenue, came from the broad based industrial end market in fiscal year 2007, a 7% increase year-to-year. Medical, security, automotive, defense, and instrumentation applications all contributed to growth during the year. -- Revenue from consumer applications was 22% of product revenue and grew significantly during 2007, increasing 23%, with digital TVs, digital cameras, home theatre and video games as the primary drivers. -- Revenue from communications applications was 22% of product revenue and increased 7% during 2007. -- Revenue from computer applications was 9% of product revenue and declined 17% year-to-year, primarily as a result of the Company's decision to deemphasize power management products used in desktop and laptop computers. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $820 million, or 32.2% of total revenue in fiscal year 2007, compared to $621 million, or 26.5% of total revenue, in the prior year. Gross margin totaled $1.5 billion, or 59.7% of revenue, for the fiscal year 2007. In the prior year, gross margin totaled $1.4 billion, or 59.9% of revenue, and included approximately $20 million, or 0.9% of revenue, in restructuring related expenses. Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP gross margin was 59.1% of revenue in fiscal year 2007 compared to 60.8% in the prior year. Gross margin as a percentage of product revenue declined compared to the prior year primarily as a result of strong growth in revenue from products used in consumer applications where gross margin as a percentage of revenue is generally below the Company average. Operating expenses totaled $953 million in fiscal year 2007 compared to $881 million in the prior year. In fiscal year 2007, ADI increased spending in R&D by approximately $50 million, primarily to support strategic analog product development programs. In addition, in fiscal year 2007, the Company recorded $40 million in special charges. Operating margin totaled $566 million, or 22.2% of revenue, for the fiscal year 2007. Excluding non-recurring or one time items, non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product revenue was 22.4% in fiscal 2007 versus 24.2% in the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the decline in gross margin. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.51 for the fiscal year 2007, compared to $1.39 for the prior year. Excluding non-recurring or one time items, non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.48 in fiscal year 2007 as compared to $1.35 in the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of the share repurchases which reduced the diluted shares 10.4%. Divestitures During the fourth quarter, on September 9, 2007, ADI signed a definitive agreement to sell its wireless handset baseband chipset and radio transceiver operation. This business represented $50.3 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The previously announced divestiture of this business is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. ADI has accounted for the divested operation as a discontinued operation. Assets and liabilities related to this business, including inventory, accounts receivable, and property plant and equipment have been reclassified as such. After accounting for assets included in the sale and other costs, the sale is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $280 to $290 million and an after tax gain of approximately $150 to $160 million. After accounting for the wireless handset baseband and radio business as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis points and non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased 160 basis points. Diluted EPS was unchanged. "The financial rationale for divesting this business is important, but equally important is the improved strategic clarity this brings to our ongoing investment decisions," explained Mr. Fishman. "We plan to continue to develop other products for the wireless handset market, but we will focus our investments in products where we offer technology that is differentiated and provides sustainable value to leading handset manufacturers -- products that improve energy efficiency, music and voice quality, picture quality, and the overall user experience." On November 8, 2007, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, ADI signed a definitive agreement to sell its CPU voltage regulation and PC thermal monitoring operation. This business represented approximately $25 million of revenue during the fourth quarter. The previously announced divestiture of this business is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This business is reported with continuing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and will be included in discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. To facilitate an orderly transfer of the business to the buyer, at closing ADI expects to enter into a pre-paid one-year manufacturing supply arrangement whereby ADI will continue to manufacture the products at its wafer fabrication facility in Limerick, Ireland. After accounting for assets included in the sale, other costs and the prepaid manufacturing supply agreement, the sale is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $85 to $92 million and an after tax gain of approximately $52 to $60 million. Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2008 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the CPU Voltage Regulation and PC Thermal Monitoring business will be accounted for as a discontinued operation. Please refer to the table, "Assumptions Used to Estimate Results for the First Quarter Ending February 2, 2008," or Schedule H, for details. -- Revenue from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be in the range of +2% to -2% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. -- Gross margin from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be slightly above 60% of revenue. -- Operating expenses from continuing operations are planned to decrease slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the immediately prior quarter, excluding the restructuring expense recorded in the fourth quarter and accounting for the CPU Voltage Regulation and PC Thermal Monitoring business as a discontinued operation. -- The tax rate for the first quarter is estimated at 23% to 25%. -- Non-operating income for the first quarter is estimated at $15 million. -- Shares used for the diluted EPS calculation are estimated at 311 million. -- Excluding the gains from the sales of the divested businesses, diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is planned to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Company's business. Economic Substance Behind Management's Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses: Purchased In-Process R&D. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating income: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Purchased In-Process R&D. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party. On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party. This payment increased revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 by $35 million. We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Purchased In-Process R&D. We incur in-process research and development expenses when technological feasibility for acquired technology has not been established and no future alternative use for such technology exists. We exclude these items because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Acquisition-Related Expense. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a tax adjustment when we finalized the accounting associated with our fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 acquisition. We excluded this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it was not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Restructuring-Related Expense. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. Proceeds from the One-Time Settlement of Litigation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business. Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed to accept their report and filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit resulted in an income tax benefit. We excluded these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they were not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Gain on Sale of Investment. We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results. Gain on the Sale of a Product Line. We realized a gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. This amount arose from prior activities and has no direct correlation to the ongoing business operations. Tax Adjustment Associated with IRS Examination. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the IRS completed its field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Although the IRS has not issued its final report for fiscal 2004 and 2005, they have issued proposed adjustments related to these two fiscal years. We have provided $4.4 million for taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed adjustments. We exclude this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit. The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results. Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company. Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company's use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Management's Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. About Analog Devices, Inc.

Important factors that may affect future operating results include: with respect to the divestitures described above, the closing of each of those transactions is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and other material closing conditions, any failure of which to satisfy may delay or prevent the closing of the relevant transaction; either or both transactions may involve unexpected costs, thereby reducing the net proceeds to ADI; the expected benefits of either or both transactions may not be achieved in a timely manner, or at all; and with respect to ADI's business generally, other factors that may affect future operating results include the effects of changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products, competitive pricing pressures, unavailability of raw materials or wafer fabrication, assembly and test capacity, any delay or cancellation of significant customer orders, any inability to manage inventory to meet customer demand, changes in geographic, product or customer mix, adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States and international markets, adverse results in litigation matters, and other risk factors described in our most recent Form 10-Q, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our results of operations for the periods presented in this release are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future periods. Any projections in this release are based on limited information currently available to Analog Devices, which is subject to change. Although any such projections and the factors influencing them will likely change, we will not necessarily update the information, as we will only provide guidance at certain points during the year.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products, the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications. The categorization of products is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.
