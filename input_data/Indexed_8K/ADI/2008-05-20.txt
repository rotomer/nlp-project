Accounts receivable at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased by 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter, with days sales outstanding declining from 51 days to 47 days.
ADI had a very strong quarter driven by continued momentum of our broad, highly diversified core business, as well as increased penetration of new product categories and fast-growing applications, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. Our significant growth on both the top and bottom lines reflects our leading converter and amplifier positions as well as the benefits of strategic investments and product portfolio decisions weve made over the last few years. Most importantly, our results continue to demonstrate the value that customers place on innovating and collaborating with ADI to solve the toughest signal processing challenges and achieve competitive advantage.
:
Revenue by end market in the second quarter of fiscal 2008
The industrial and communications end markets produced strong growth in the quarter, with sales to both increasing on a sequential and year-over-year basis.
Revenue from industrial customers grew 8% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. There was sequential growth in most industrial applications, with the largest increases in the instrumentation, semiconductor automatic test equipment, automotive, and medical end markets.
Revenue from communications customers increased 10% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. The sequential growth in the communications market was principally driven by very strong growth in revenue from base station applications.
Revenue from consumer customers was down slightly both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of a slowdown in consumer spending in response to the uncertain economic environment.

Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2008
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, Mr. Fishman said, Orders remained strong in the second quarter, and increased in comparison to the immediately prior quarter. Our operating plan for the third quarter is for revenue to be in the range of $650 to $665 million, or flat to up 3% sequentially, gross margin to be approximately 61%, and operating expenses to increase slightly. However, our plan does not factor in potential effects of ongoing financial market uncertainty which could translate into a more cautious stance from our customers. If the operating plan is achieved, diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $0.43 to $0.45 and diluted EPS from discontinued operations is expected to be approximately $0.02 to $0.03.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00
Mr. Fishman will discuss the second quarter's results and the near-term outlook via webcast, accessible at today beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Management
s Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature. Tables reconciling our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided in this release.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expense.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we settled a lawsuit against Maxim Integrated Products and received a one-time non-recurring payment of $19 million. A portion of this payment ($8.5 million) was to compensate us for the legal expenses we incurred during the years 2001 through 2007 in connection with this lawsuit. As the original legal expenses were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the income statement, we recorded the recovery of these legal expenses in the same line item in our operating expenses. The remaining $10.5 million was recorded as non-operating income because it is not associated with the normal operations of our business. We exclude this payment and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation.

Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Management
s Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP gross margin:
On November 9, 2006, we received a one-time, non-recurring payment of $35 million in exchange for granting a license of certain intellectual property rights to a third party.

We exclude this item and the related tax effects from our non-GAAP results because it is a one-time item not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Non-Recurring Revenue Associated with the License of Certain Intellectual Property Rights to a Third Party.

Restructuring-Related Expense.
The following items are excluded from our Non-GAAP operating expenses:

Purchased In-Process R&D.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a tax adjustment when we finalized the accounting associated with our fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 acquisition. We excluded this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it was not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Acquisition-Related Expense.
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures and other reorganization efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.

Proceeds from the one-time settlement of litigation.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the United States Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) completed its examination of fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 and issued their report. The Company agreed to accept their report and filed its 2005 tax return and an amended return for 2004 to conform to the methodologies agreed to during the 2001-2003 examination. The completion of this examination and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the IRS audit resulted in an income tax benefit. We excluded these income tax benefits from our non-GAAP results because they were not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated with IRS Tax Settlement.
We realized a gain of $8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 from the sale of a minority shareholding in a company. We excluded this amount and the related tax effects because it is a one-time item not associated with our ongoing operating results.
Gain on Sale of Investment.
We realized a gain on the sale of our DSP-based DSL ASIC and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. This amount arose from prior activities and has no direct correlation to the ongoing business operations.
Gain on the Sale of a Product Line.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the IRS completed its field examination of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. Although the IRS has not issued its final report for fiscal 2004 and 2005, they have issued proposed adjustments related to these two fiscal years. We have provided $4.4 million for taxes and penalties related to certain of these proposed adjustments. We exclude this income tax expense from our non-GAAP results because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Adjustment Associated with IRS Examination.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA created a temporary incentive for US multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. During fiscal 2005, we repatriated $1,055 million of accumulated foreign earnings. Under current tax law, the earnings repatriated prior to October 29, 2005 were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate. We exclude this item from our non-GAAP results because it was a temporary incentive and is not associated with the ongoing operations of our business.
Tax Expense Associated with the Repatriation of Foreign Earnings.
The IRS reinstated the R&D tax credit in December 2006, retroactive to January 1, 2006. This retroactive reinstatement resulted in a $10 million income tax savings to the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We excluded this income tax savings from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the income tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax Savings Associated with Reinstatement of the Federal R&D Tax Credit.

Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
