On May 30, 2008, Analog Devices, Inc. issued a press release announcing the settlement by the Company and its President and CEO, Mr. Jerald G. Fishman, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thereby concluding the Commissions investigation into the Companys stock option granting practices. Neither the Company nor Mr. Fishman admitted or denied any of the Commissions allegations or findings.
As previously disclosed, the Commission concluded that: the appropriate grant date for the September 4, 1998 options should have been September 8, 1998 (which is one trading day later than the date that was used to price the options); the appropriate grant date for the November 30, 1999 options should have been November 29, 1999 (which is one trading day earlier than the date that was used to price the options); and the appropriate grant date for the July 18, 2001 options should have been July 26, 2001 (which is five trading days later than the date that was used to price the options). The Commission did not charge the Company or Mr. Fishman with any violation of law related to the granting of options prior to the release of favorable financial results.
In connection with the settlement, the Company consented to a cease-and-desist order under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $3 million, and agreed to reprice options granted to Mr. Fishman in 1999 and 2001. No other options granted by the Company are affected by the settlement. Mr. Fishman consented to a cease-and-desist order under Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act, agreed to pay a civil money penalty of $1 million, and agreed to make a disgorgement payment of $450,000 (plus interest) with respect to options granted in 1998.
The Company has determined that no restatement of its historical financial results is necessary due to the settlement.
The full text of the press release issued by the Company in connection with the foregoing announcement is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report, and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company first disclosed the SECs investigation into its stock option granting practices in its 2004 Form 10-K filing. As previously disclosed by the Company, the SEC order concludes that the appropriate grant dates for three stock option grants made by the Company in 1998, 1999 and 2001 should have been as follows: the September 4, 1998 grant date should have been one trading day later (September 8, 1998); the November 30, 1999 grant date should have been one trading day earlier (November 29, 1999); and the July 18, 2001 grant date should have been five trading days later (July 26, 2001). With respect to these three option grants, there is no allegation or finding that Mr. Fishman acted with bad intent or recklessness; the claim as to Mr. Fishman is solely under Section 17(a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.
As disclosed in the Companys Form 10-Q filing in February of 2008, the Commission did not charge either the Company or Mr. Fishman with respect to grants of options prior to the release of favorable financial results.
