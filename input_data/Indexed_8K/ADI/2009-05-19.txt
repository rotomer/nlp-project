of common stock
ADIs second quarter results were better than planned as we benefited from increased sales to communications infrastructure and consumer customers and a general abatement of inventory reductions by our customers. In addition, our second quarter expenses were significantly lower than originally planned as we aggressively reduced spending in response to ongoing economic uncertainty, said President and CEO Jerald G. Fishman. Despite the challenging environment, our business model continues to allow us to generate solid profits and cash flow as it has done for many years, giving us the flexibility to execute the strategic investment and cost reduction initiatives that we expect will drive significant operating leverage when demand recovers.
Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2009
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially, including as a result of the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases.
Regarding the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Mr. Fishman stated, Orders to ADI and our distributors recovered significantly in the second quarter, as customer inventory reductions subsided. Our book-to-bill ratio for the second quarter, as measured by end customer bookings, was slightly above one for the first time since the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and our third quarter opening backlog was up from last quarter. In addition, order levels were stable throughout the second quarter and have remained at these levels through the first two weeks of May. Nevertheless, our lead times remain short and we are still receiving a significant portion of new orders as turns orders, thereby limiting visibility.
Mr. Fishman continued, Given these factors, were planning for our third quarter revenue to be approximately flat on a sequential basis. We plan to continue to reduce inventories in the third quarter, and to keep very tight control over operating expenses. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 54% to 55%, depending on end market revenue mix and factory utilization, and are planning for operating expenses to remain approximately flat sequentially. In addition, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a result, we are planning for diluted EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
Mr. Fishman will discuss the second fiscal quarters results and short-term outlook via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors who prefer to join by telephone may call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI."

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. A table reconciling the Companys non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures is provided in this release.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the underlying baseline operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, our non-GAAP operating income, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology in excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
