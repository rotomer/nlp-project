Exhibit 10.1
2006 Stock Incentive Plan: Standard Version (U.S.) Division: ABC Division Location: Norwood, MA
We are pleased to advise the Participant that Analog Devices, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), has granted to the Participant Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") on the terms and conditions set forth below (the "Award"). This Award reflects the Company's confidence in the Participant's commitment and contributions to the success and continued growth of the Company.
     1. . This memorandum confirms that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Analog Devices, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), the Company has granted to the Participant (the "Participant"), effective on the Date of Grant set forth below, that number of RSUs set forth below:
Restricted Stock Unit
Each one (1) RSU shall, if and when it vests in accordance with this Award, automatically convert into one (1) share of common stock, US$0.16 2/3 par value, of the Company ("Common Stock") issuable as provided below. The RSUs are subject to the vesting provisions set forth in Section 2, the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 and the right of the Company to retain Shares (as defined below) pursuant to Section 7.
     2. .
Vesting and Conversion
          (a) Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Award, the RSUs shall vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in Section 1. For purposes of this Award, RSUs that have not vested as of any particular time in accordance with this Section 2(a) are referred to as "Unvested RSUs." The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon the vesting and conversion of the RSUs are referred to in this Award as "Shares." As soon as administratively practicable after the issuance of any Shares upon the vesting and conversion of RSUs, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered evidence (which may include a book entry by the Company's transfer agent) of the Shares so issued in the name of the Participant to the brokerage firm designated by the Company to maintain the brokerage account established for the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to or in the name of the Participant upon the vesting and conversion of any RSUs unless the issuance of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
          (b) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Participant or by the Company for any reason or no reason (other than due to death or Disability or as otherwise provided in the Plan or below), then in each such case, all of the Unvested RSUs as of the date of termination shall terminate and be cancelled immediately and automatically and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Unvested RSUs. For purposes of the foregoing, the date of termination shall mean the earliest of (i)
 
the date on which notice of termination is provided by the Company to the Participant, (ii) the last day of the Participant's active service with the Company, or (iii) the last day on which the Participant is an employee of the Company, as determined in each case without including any required advance notice period and irrespective of the status of the termination under local labor or employment laws.
          (c) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of the Participant's death, all Unvested RSUs shall vest in full as of the date of the Participant's death.
          (d) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company terminates by reason of Disability (as defined below), the Unvested RSUs as of the date of the Participant's termination shall vest in full as of the date of the termination. For the purpose of this Award, "Disability" means (i) the Participant's inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, as determined by the Company.
          (e) For purposes of this Award, employment with the Company shall include employment with any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary of the Company, or any successor to the Company or any such parent or subsidiary of the Company.
     3. .
Restrictions on Transfer
          (a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber any RSUs, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
          (b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the RSUs which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such RSUs any transferee to whom such RSUs have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
     4. . The RSUs represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares upon vesting and conversion of the RSUs, and until vesting of the RSUs and issuance of the Shares, the Participant shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Participant shall have no right to receive any dividends and shall have no voting rights with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs for which the record date is on or before the date on which the Shares underlying the RSUs are issued to the Participant.
Not a Shareholder
     5. . The RSUs and Shares, including the grant and issuance thereof, are subject to the provisions of the Plan. A copy of the Plan prospectus is available on the Company's Intranet at www.analog.com/employee (from Signals home page, click Knowledge Centers, HR, Employee Stock Programs. The related documents can be found in the right-hand column).
Provisions of the Plan
     6. . Any Shares that are issued and any cash payment that is delivered, in either case upon settlement of the RSUs pursuant to this Award, will be in consideration of the Participant's entering into employment with the Company and/or his continued employment with the Company, which consideration is deemed sufficient.
Consideration
     7. .
Withholding Taxes
     (a) Regardless of any action the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local taxes and/or non-U.S. taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility, and that the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to the RSUs and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
     (b) Prior to the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs, if any taxing jurisdiction requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company may withhold a sufficient number of whole Shares otherwise issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market Value (as defined under the Plan) sufficient to pay the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the Shares. The cash equivalent of the Shares withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the RSUs and the issuance of Shares hereunder. Alternatively, the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant may, in its discretion, withhold any amount necessary to pay the Tax-Related Items from the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, with no withholding in Shares. In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through the withholding of Shares or through the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, no Shares will be issued upon vesting of the RSUs unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such RSUs. By accepting this grant of RSUs, the Participant expressly consents to the withholding of Shares and/or cash as provided for hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to the RSUs and any Shares delivered in payment thereof are the Participant's sole responsibility.
     8. . Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Award and except where otherwise prohibited under local law or where cash settlement may present adverse tax consequences to the Participant, at the time the RSUs vest, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, to deliver by wire transfer to the Participant in lieu of Shares an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7 herein.
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
     9. . The Company hereby notifies the Participant of the following in relation to the Participant's personal data and the collection, processing and transfer of such data in relation to the grant of the RSUs and the Participant's participation in the Plan, pursuant to applicable personal data protection laws. The collection, processing and transfer of the Participant's personal data is necessary for the Company's administration of the Plan and the Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Participant's denial and/or objection to the collection, processing and transfer of personal data may affect the Participant's ability to participate in the Plan. As such, the Participant voluntarily acknowledges, consents and agrees (where required under applicable law) to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described herein.
Data Privacy
     The Company holds certain personal information about the Participant, including the Participant's name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social security number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant's favor, for the purpose of managing and administering the Plan ("Data"). The Data may be provided by the Participant or collected, where lawful, from third parties, and the Company will process the Data for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan. The data processing will take place through electronic and non-electronic means according to logistics and procedures strictly correlated to the purposes for which the Data is collected and with confidentiality and security provisions as set forth by applicable laws and regulations in the Participant's country of residence. Data processing operations will be performed minimizing the use of personal and identification data when such operations are unnecessary for the processing purposes sought. The Data will be accessible within the Company's organization only by those persons requiring access for purposes of the implementation, administration and operation of the Plan and for the Participant's participation in the Plan.
     The Company will transfer Data as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management of the Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Company may further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. These recipients
 
may be located in the United States, the European Economic Area, or elsewhere throughout the world. The Participant hereby authorizes (where required under applicable law) the recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant's participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant's behalf to a broker or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan.
     The Participant may, at any time, exercise the Participant's rights provided under applicable personal data protection laws, which may include the right to (a) obtain confirmation as to the existence of the Data, (b) verify the content, origin and accuracy of the Data, (c) request the integration, update, amendment, deletion, or blockage (for breach of applicable laws) of the Data, and (d) to oppose, for legal reasons, the collection, processing or transfer of the Data which is not necessary or required for the implementation, administration and/or operation of the Plan and the Participant's participation in the Plan. The Participant may seek to exercise these rights by contacting the Participant's local HR manager.
     10. . The Participant agrees, as a condition of the grant of the RSUs, as applicable, to repatriate all payments attributable to the Shares and/or cash acquired under the Plan (including, but not limited to, dividends and any proceeds derived from the sale of the Shares acquired pursuant to the RSUs) in accordance with all foreign exchange rules and regulations applicable to the Participant. In addition, the Participant also agrees to take any and all actions, and consent to any and all actions taken by the Company and its subsidiaries, as may be required to allow the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Participant. Finally, the Participant agrees to take any and all actions as may be required to comply with the Participant's personal legal and tax obligations under all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Participant.
Repatriation; Compliance with Laws
     11. .
Miscellaneous
          (a) . The grant of the RSUs shall not confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company nor limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. The vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by satisfaction of the performance conditions, if any, and continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or engaged or being granted the RSUs hereunder).
No Rights to Employment
          (b) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time. The grant of the RSUs under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of RSUs or any other award under the Plan or other benefits in lieu thereof in the future. Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of any grant, the number of Shares subject to the grant, and the vesting provisions. Any amendment, modification or termination of the Plan shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of the Participant's employment with the Company.
Discretionary Nature
          (c) . The Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary. The value of the RSUs and any other awards granted under the Plan is an extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of the Participant's employment with the Company (and the Participant's employment contract, if any). Any grant under the Plan, including the grant of the RSUs, is not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension, or retirement benefits or similar payments.
Exclusion from Termination Indemnities and Other Benefits
          (d) . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Award shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Award, and each other provision of this Award shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
Severability
 
          (e) . Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Award may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Waiver
          (f) . This Award shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Participant and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 3 of this Award.
Binding Effect
          (g) . Each notice relating to this Award shall be in writing (which shall include electronic form) and delivered in person, electronically or by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address as hereinafter provided. Each notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date it is received. Each notice to the Company shall be addressed to it at its offices at Analog Devices, Inc., One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts, 02062, Attention: Chief Financial Officer. Each notice to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at the Participant's last known mailing or email address, as applicable, on the records of the Company.

          (h) . Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Award shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.
Pronouns
          (i) . This Award and the Plan constitute the entire understanding between the parties, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of these documents.
Entire Agreement
          (j) . This Award shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws.
Governing Law
          (k) . The interpretation and construction of any terms or conditions of this Award or the Plan, or other matters related to the Plan, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be final and conclusive.

The Participant is urged to read this Award carefully and to consult with his or her own legal counsel regarding the terms and consequences of this Award and the legal and binding effect of this Award. By virtue of his or her acceptance of this Award, the Participant is deemed to have accepted and agreed to all of the terms and conditions of this Award and the provisions of the Plan.

Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if the Participant transfers the Participant's residence and/or employment to a country other than the United States, the RSUs shall be subject to any special terms and conditions for such country as may be set forth in an addendum to this Confirming Memorandum (the "Addendum"), which terms and conditions will apply to the Participant to the extent the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or to facilitate the administration of the Plan. Any Addendum shall constitute part of this Confirming Memorandum.
Addendum
 
          (p) . The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the RSUs, any Shares acquired pursuant to the RSUs, and the Participant's participation in the Plan, to the extent the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that such other requirements are necessary or advisable in order to comply with local law or to facilitate the administration of the Plan.

As soon as administratively practicable after the issuance of any Shares upon the vesting and conversion of RSUs, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered evidence (which may include a book entry by the Company's transfer agent) of the Shares so issued in the name of the Participant to the brokerage firm designated by the Company to maintain the brokerage account established for the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to or in the name of the Participant upon the vesting and conversion of any RSUs unless the issuance of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
          (b) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Participant or by the Company for any reason or no reason (other than due to death or disability or as otherwise in the Plan or below), then in each such case, all of the Unvested RSUs as of the date of termination shall terminate and
 
be cancelled immediately and automatically and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Unvested RSUs. For purposes of the foregoing, the date of termination shall mean the earliest of (i) the date on which notice of termination is provided by the Company to the Participant, (ii) the last day of the Participant's active service with the Company, or (iii) the last day on which the Participant is an employee of the Company, as determined in each case without including any required advance notice period and irrespective of the status of the termination under local labor or employment laws.
          (c) In the event the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated by reason of the Participant's death, all Unvested RSUs shall vest in full as of the date of the Participant's death.
          (d) In the event the Participant's employment terminates by reason of a disability (as determined by the Company in accordance with local law), the Unvested RSUs as of the date of the Participant's disability shall vest in full as of the date of such disability.
          (e) For purposes of this Award, employment with the Company shall include employment with any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary of the Company, or any successor to the Company or any such parent or subsidiary of the Company.
     3. .

          (b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the RSUs which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such RSUs any transferee to whom such RSUs have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
     4. . The RSUs represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares upon vesting and conversion of the RSUs, and until vesting of the RSUs and issuance of the Shares, the Participant shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Participant shall have no right to receive any dividends and shall have no voting rights with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs for which the record date is on or before the date on which the Shares underlying the RSUs are issued to the Participant.

A copy of the Plan prospectus is available on the Company's Intranet at www.analog.com/employee (from Signals home page, click Knowledge Centers, HR, Employee Stock Programs. The related documents can be found in the right-hand column).
Provisions of the Plan
     6. . Any Shares that are issued and any cash payment that is delivered, in either case upon settlement of the RSUs pursuant to this Award, will be in consideration of the Participant's entering into employment with the Company and/or his continued employment with the Company, which consideration is deemed sufficient.
Consideration
     7. .
Withholding Taxes
     (a) Regardless of any action the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant takes with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local taxes and/or non-U.S. taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility, and that the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired pursuant to the RSUs and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
     (b) Prior to the delivery of Shares upon the vesting of the RSUs, if any taxing jurisdiction requires withholding of Tax-Related Items, the Company may withhold a sufficient number of whole Shares otherwise issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market Value (as defined under the Plan) sufficient to pay the minimum Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the Shares. The cash equivalent of the Shares withheld will be used to settle the obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). No fractional Shares will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the RSUs and the issuance of Shares hereunder. Alternatively, the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant may, in its discretion, withhold any amount necessary to pay the Tax-Related Items from the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, with no withholding in Shares. In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through the withholding of Shares or through the Participant's salary or other amounts payable to the Participant, no Shares will be issued upon vesting of the RSUs unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items which the Company and the subsidiary that employs the Participant determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such RSUs. By accepting this grant of RSUs, the Participant expressly consents to the withholding of Shares and/or cash as provided for hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to the RSUs and any Shares delivered in payment thereof are the Participant's sole responsibility.
     8. . Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Award and except where otherwise prohibited under local law or where cash settlement may present adverse tax consequences to the Participant, at the time the RSUs vest, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, to deliver by wire transfer to the Participant in lieu of Shares an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the applicable vesting date). If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient in the opinion of the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7 herein.
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
     9. . The Company hereby notifies the Participant of the following in relation to the Participant's personal data and the collection, processing and transfer of such data in relation to the grant of the RSUs and the Participant's participation in the Plan, pursuant to applicable personal data protection laws. The collection, processing and transfer of the Participant's personal data is necessary for the Company's administration of the Plan and the Participant's participation in the Plan, and the Participant's denial and/or objection to the collection, processing and transfer of personal data may affect the Participant's ability to participate in the Plan. As such, the Participant voluntarily acknowledges, consents and agrees (where required under applicable law) to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as described herein.

Miscellaneous
          (a) . The grant of the RSUs shall not confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company nor limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. The vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by satisfaction of the performance conditions, if any, and continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or engaged or being granted the RSUs hereunder).
No Rights to Employment
          (b) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time.

Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of any grant, the number of Shares subject to the grant, and the vesting provisions. Any amendment, modification or termination of the Plan shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of the Participant's employment with the Company.
Discretionary Nature
          (c) . The Participant's participation in the Plan is voluntary. The value of the RSUs and any other awards granted under the Plan is an extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of the Participant's employment with the Company (and the Participant's employment contract, if any).
