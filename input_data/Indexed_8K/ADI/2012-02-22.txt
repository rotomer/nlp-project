Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Announces First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results; Increases Dividend by 20 Percent to $0.30 Per Share
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 22, 2012--Analog Devices, Inc. (NYSE: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2012, a 14-week period that ended February 4, 2012. ADI also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 20 percent increase in its regular quarterly dividend to $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock.
The first quarter results were within the range we expected. Revenue of $648 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.46 declined compared to both the immediately prior quarter and the year-ago quarter. Late in the first quarter, order rates began to accelerate and have remained solid so far this quarter. This leads us to believe that the first quarter marked the bottom of this industry cycle and we expect our business will improve beginning in the second quarter, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO.
Results for the 14-Week First Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Revenue totaled $648 million
Gross margin was 63.2% of revenue
Operating margin was 28.3% of revenue
Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.46
Cash flow from operations was $215 million, or 33% of revenue
Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.
ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 28, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2012.
Outlook for the 13-Week Second Quarter of Fiscal 2012
Revenue estimated at $655 million to $675 million
Gross margin estimated at 64% to 64.5%
Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $226 million
Diluted EPS estimated at $0.48 to $0.53
We expect most of the growth in the second quarter will come from our industrial customers, with more modest growth expected from the automotive, consumer, and communications infrastructure end markets in aggregate, said Mr. Fishman. Importantly, while we see improvement in our business, we are mindful of the uncertain macroeconomic environment and we will continue to aggressively monitor and control expenses in the second quarter.
Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET
ADI will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone (call 706-634-7193 ten minutes before the call begins and provide the password "ADI.")
A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 855-859-2056 (replay only) and providing the conference ID: 49242709, or by visiting investor.analog.com.
Non-GAAP Financial Information for Fiscal Year 2011 First Quarter
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to taxes that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years, which we now believe we can recover; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP diluted EPS has material limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
