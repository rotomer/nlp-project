Exhibit 99.1
Analog Devices Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Results
NORWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 27, 2012--Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADI), a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 3, 2012.
ADI delivered solid results for the fourth quarter, with revenue increasing by 2% and diluted EPS increasing by 4% compared to the prior quarter, said Jerald G. Fishman, CEO. For the year, revenue decreased 9.8% to about $2.7 billion, reflecting difficult economic conditions and prevailing global uncertainty. We nevertheless generated 65% gross margins, 31% operating margins and over $800 million, or 30% of revenue, in cash from operations for the year.
Mr. Fishman continued, Overall orders decreased during the quarter as customers became more cautious and continued to reduce inventories, in many cases to historically low levels. As a result, we began reducing our production levels in the fourth quarter and will reduce them further in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to keep our inventory at appropriate levels. While this will reduce gross margins in the short term, we believe this should provide significant operating leverage when growth resumes.
ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 18, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2012.

Revenue totaled $695 million
Gross margin was 63.8% of revenue
Operating margin was 31% of revenue
Diluted EPS was $0.58
Cash flow from operations was $236 million, or 34% of revenue
Results for Fiscal Year 2012

Operating margin was 30.5% of revenue

Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.
Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2013
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.
Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.
Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Restructuring-Related Expenses.
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to taxes that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a one-time $10.8 million tax benefit for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Tax-Related Items.
In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a one-time $3.4 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors
Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.
Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.
Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
