ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Decatur, IL -- January 24, 2003 -- Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM)
Second quarter earnings per share were $ .20 compared to $ .23 last year as Operating Profit decreased
to $297 million from $341 million.
* Oilseeds Processing results were negatively impacted by lower
North American Crush margins.
* Corn Processing results increased due to improved ethanol demand.
* Wheat Processing results decreased due to adverse crop conditions.
* Agricultural Services results were negatively affected by
difficult market conditions.
* Other results improved, driven primarily by bioproducts, cocoa
and other international businesses.
Second Quarter Highlights.
(Amounts in thousands, except per share data and percentages)
Improved profits in international oilseeds processing did not fully offset
lower North American results. Poor crops in North America negatively
impacted grain storage and transportation revenues. Corn processing,
cocoa and bioproducts contributed strong results for the quarter. Our
growing global franchise continues to produce value for our shareholders.

Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 were $ 131,245,000 or
$ .20 per share compared with $ 150,025,000 or $ .23 per share last year.
This year's results include a $ .02 per share gain from partial settlement
of the Company's claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation. Last year's
results included a $ .04 per share gain related to the vitamin antitrust litigation
settlements and a $ .02 per share loss related to security transactions. For
fiscal year 2003, six months net earnings were $ 239,320,000 or $ .37 per share
compared to $ 281,643,000 or $ .43 per share last year. Current year's six month
results include a gain of $ .02 per share from the vitamin antitrust litigation
settlements. Last year's six month results included a gain related to the vitamin
antitrust litigation settlements of $ .04 per share and a gain of $ .03 per share
from security transactions.
Segment operating profit decreased to $ 297,369,000 from $ 341,314,000 for
the quarter and to $ 537,315,000 from $ 562,545,000 for the six months.
The decline in operating profits for the quarter and six months resulted
primarily from lower North American oilseed crush margins and lower
operating results in the Agricultural Services and Wheat Processing segments
due to difficult operating conditions resulting from drought induced short crops.
These declines were partially offset by improved profits in international oilseed
processing, increased corn processing results due to improved ethanol demand and stronger results in cocoa and bioproducts operations.
