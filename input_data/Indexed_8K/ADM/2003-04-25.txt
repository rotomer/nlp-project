ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
Decatur, IL -- April 23, 2003 -- Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM)
Third quarter earnings per share were $ .18 compared to $ .18 last year.
* Corn Processing results were strong due to improved selling prices and volumes.
* Oilseeds Processing results continued to be strong in South America and Asia but were offset by weaker North American and European crush margins.
* Wheat Processing and Agricultural Services results decreased due to adverse crop conditions.
* Other results increased, driven primarily by improvements in Bioproducts and Cocoa.
 
Third Quarter Highlights.
(Amounts in thousands, except per share data and percentages)
ADM's earnings per share were comparable to last year's third quarter results despite weak industry conditions in many of our markets. Our global franchise, with product and geographic diversification, delivered solid results and strong cash flows even in these challenging market conditions. We continue to position our global assets to meet shifting production and consumption patterns and to generate shareholder value.
G. Allen Andreas, Chairman and Chief Executive

Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 were $ 116,805,000 or $ .18 per share compared with $ 117,184,000 or $ .18 per share last year. Last year's results included a $ .01 per share gain related to the vitamin antitrust litigation settlements. For fiscal year 2003, nine month net earnings were $ 356,125,000 or $ .55 per share compared to $ 398,827,000 or $ .61 per share last year. Current year's nine month results include a gain of $ .03 per share from the vitamin antitrust litigation settlements. Last year's nine month results included a gain related to the vitamin antitrust litigation settlements of $ .05 per share and a gain of $ .03 per share from security transactions.
 
Segment operating profit decreased to $ 242,370,000 from $ 254,002,000 for the quarter and to $ 779,685,000 from $ 816,547,000 for the nine months. The decline in operating profits for the quarter and nine months resulted primarily from lower North American and European oilseed crush margins. In addition, operating results in the Agricultural Services and Wheat Processing segments declined due to difficult operating conditions resulting from drought induced short crops. These declines were partially offset by increased results from Corn Processing, Cocoa, and Bioproducts operations.
