First Quarter Results
Net earnings for the first quarter ended September 30, 2003 were $150 million or $.23 per share compared with $108 million or $.17 per share last year.
 
Total Segment Operating profit increased $ 57 million to $ 297 million from $ 240 million last year. Oilseed Processing results decreased to $ 68 million from $ 76 million as improved results in the South American and Asian markets were more than offset by reduced crush margins in North America and Europe. Corn Processing results of $ 85 million were comparable to last year's strong quarter. Wheat Processing results improved to $ 26 million from $ 20 million last year as the improved current year crop conditions in the United States resulted in improved US operating conditions. Agricultural Services results improved $3 million to $ 43 million due to the balanced performance of our global grain origination and marketing system. The effect of last year's poor North American crop continued to negatively impact the North American origination and marketing system results. The Other segments increased to $ 75 million from $ 20 million last year due to improvements in the Cocoa and Bioproducts processing operati ons and improved earnings of our private equity fund investments.
