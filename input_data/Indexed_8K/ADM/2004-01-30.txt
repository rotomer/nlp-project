Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 were $ 221 million, or $ .34 per share, compared with $ 131 million, or $ .20 per share, last year. Net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2003 were $ 371 million, or $ .57 per share, compared to $ 239 million, or $ .37 per share, last year. This year's results for the quarter and six months include an asset abandonment charge of $ 29 million ($ 18 million after tax, equal to $ .03 per share). Last year's quarter and six months included a gain from partial settlement of the Company's claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation of $ 25 million ($ 15 million after tax, equal to $ .02 per share) and a loss on security transactions of $ 3 million ($ 2 million after tax).
 
Total Segment Operating profit increased $ 198 million to $ 495 million for the quarter and increased $ 254 million to $ 792 million for the six months. Oilseed processing results increased in North America and Asia while operating margins weakened in South America and Europe. Corn Processing results improved as both ethanol and sweetener volumes and selling prices improved over prior year levels. Wheat Processing results increased as improved crop conditions in North America resulted in improved volumes and production yields. Agricultural Services results improved due to the performance of our balanced global grain origination and marketing systems. With varied crop conditions around the world this year and solid worldwide demand for grains and feedstuffs, our global marketing operations performed well. Strong demand for transportation also contributed to the earnings gain. The Other segment increased due primarily to improved earnings of Specialty Feed Ingredients, Cocoa and our private equity investments.
 
The increase in Corporate expense was due primarily to LIFO inventory valuation charges of $ 53 million for the quarter and $ 61 million for the six months. Last year's six months included a LIFO inventory valuation charge of $ 11 million.
