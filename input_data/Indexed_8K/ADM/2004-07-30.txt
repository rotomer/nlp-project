Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2004 were $ 495 million, or $ .76 per share, compared to $ 451 million, or $ .70 per share, last year. Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 were a loss of $ 103 million, or $ .16 per share, compared to earnings of $ 95 million, or $ .15 per share, last year. The quarter and year ended June 30, 2004 includes a $ 400 million charge ($ 252 million after tax, or $ .39 per share) related to the settlement of fructose litigation.
Segment operating profit increased $ 37 million to $ 268 million for the quarter and increased $ 551 million to $ 1.56 billion for the year as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except the Oilseed Processing segment. Oilseed Processing operating results declined to a loss of $ 15 million for the quarter and earnings of $ 291 million for the year as Chinese contract defaults in the fourth quarter had a significant impact on global oilseed markets which negatively impacted our oilseeds operation. Corn Processing operating earnings increased to $ 150 million for the quarter and $ 661 million for the year as Bioproducts results improved due to increased volumes and selling prices of alcohol and lysine product categories which more than offset higher net corn costs. Earnings of Sweetener and Starch products declined for the quarter as increased net corn costs more than offset improved volumes and selling prices. For the year, Sweetener and Starch earnings improved due to increased volumes and selling prices. Agricultural Services' balanced global grain and marketing system continued its strong performance resulting in improved operating profits. Other segment operating profit increased to $ 88 million for the quarter and $ 359 million for the year as Food and Feed Ingredient earnings increased due to improved operating results of wheat processing and cocoa processing operations. In addition, financial operations increased primarily due to improved results of our private equity fund investments. Corporate expense for the quarter increased $ 328 million to $ 426 million due principally to the $ 400 million fructose litigation settlement partially offset by a $ 42 million credit due to changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations and an increase of $ 10 million in security gains. For the year, corporate expense increased $ 464 million due primarily to the $ 400 million fructose litigation settlement and an increased charge of $ 104 million due to changing commodity price effects on LIFO inventory valuations partially offset by increased security gains of $ 24 million.
Fiscal 2004 fourth quarter includes a $ 400 million ($ 252 million after tax, equal to $ .39 per share) charge for the fructose litigation settlement, $ 10 million ($ 6 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of asset abandonment charges and $ 12 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of security gains. Last years fourth quarter included $ 13 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of asset abandonment charges and $ 2 million ($ 1 million after tax) of security gains. Fiscal 2004 twelve month results includes a $ 400 million ($ 252 million after tax, equal to $ .39 per share) charge for the fructose litigation settlement, $ 51 million ($32 million after tax, equal to $ .05 per share) of asset abandonment charges, a $ 21 million ($ 13 million after tax, equal to $ .02 per share) gain from an insurance-related lawsuit pertaining to the flood of 1 993 and $ 24 million ($ 15 million after tax, equal to $ .02 a share) of security gains. Fiscal 2003 twelve month results include $ 13 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) of asset abandonment charges, a $ 28 million ($ 17 million after tax, equal to $ .03 per share) gain from partial settlements of the Company's claims related to vitamin antitrust litigation, and an $ 11 million ($ 7 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) charge related to the company's global settlement with the EPA.
