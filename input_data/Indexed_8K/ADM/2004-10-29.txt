Discussion of Operations
 
Net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 were $ 266 million, equal to $ .41 per share, compared to $ 150 million, equal to $ .23 per share last year, an increase of 77%.
Segment operating profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 increased $ 42 million to $ 339 million as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except the Corn Processing segment. Oilseeds Processing operating earnings increased to $ 91 million from $ 68 million last year as improved North American and European operating results were partially offset by decreased operating results in our Asian operations. Corn Processing operating earnings declined to $ 103 million from $ 107 million last year. Bioproducts results improved to $ 48 million from $ 18 million last year as higher ethanol and feed ingredient bioproduct selling prices more than offset higher net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches were negatively impacted by higher net corn costs resulting in earnings of $ 55 million co mpared to earnings of $ 89 million last year. Agricultural Services operating earnings increased to $ 51 million from $ 43 million last year as improvements in North American origination and transportation operating results more than offset a decline from the prior year's strong global grain merchandising results. Other segment operating earnings increased to $ 93 million from $ 79 million last year. Food and Feed Ingredient earnings increased $ 29 million to $ 89 million due to improved operating results of our Cocoa operations and improved earnings of the GRUMA corn flour venture. Financial operations declined $ 15 million primarily due to a decrease in results of our private equity fund investments. For the quarter, Corporate improved to $ 47 million of income this year from $ 79 million of expense last year due primarily to a $ 116 million credit from the effect of changing commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations compared to a LIFO charge of $ 8 million last year.
