Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 were $ 314 million, or $ .48 per share, compared to $ 221 million, or $ .34 per share, last year. Net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2004 were $ 580 million, or $ .89 per share, compared to $ 371 million, or $ .57 per share, last year. This year's results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2004 include an after-tax gain of $ 45 million, or $ .07 per share, representing the Company's equity share of the gain reported by its unconsolidated affiliate, CIP, upon the sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle. Last year's results for the quarter and six months included an asset abandonment charge of $ 29 million ($ 18 million after tax, equal to $ .03 per share).
Segment Operating profit declined $ 10 million to $ 485 million for the quarter but increased $ 32 million to $ 823 million for the six months.
Oilseed Processing operating profit for the quarter of $ 119 million declined slightly from $ 121 million last year as improved operating results in Europe and Asia were offset by decreased operating results in our North and South American operations. For the six months, Oilseed Processing operating profit increased to $ 210 million from $ 189 million last year as improved European operating results were partially offset by a decline in North American, South American and Asian operating earnings.
Corn Processing operating profit declined $ 40 million to $ 132 million for the quarter and declined $ 44 million to $ 235 million for the six months due principally to higher net corn and energy costs as compared to last year. However, as net corn costs in fiscal 2005 continue to decline, second quarter Corn Processing operating profits increased 28% over first quarter levels. Sweetener and Starches earnings declined $ 31 million to $ 45 million for the quarter and declined $65 million to $ 100 million for the six months due principally to higher net corn and energy costs. For the quarter, Bioproducts operating profits declined $ 9 million to $ 87 million as the effect of higher net corn and energy costs, lower ethanol sales volumes and lower lysine selling prices more than offset the positive impact of higher ethan ol selling prices. For the six months, Bioproducts operating profits increased $ 21 million to $ 135 million due principally to higher ethanol selling prices.
Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $ 18 million to $ 88 million for the quarter and decreased $ 10 million to $ 139 million for the six months as improvements in North American origination and transportation operating results were more than offset by a decline from the prior year's strong global grain merchandising results.
Other segment operating profit increased to $ 146 million from $ 96 million for the quarter and increased to $ 239 million from $ 174 million for the six months due principally to improved Financial operating results. Food and Feed Ingredient earnings of $ 71 million for the quarter were comparable to last year. Earnings of Food and Feed Ingredients increased to $ 160 million for the six months due principally to improved operating results of our Cocoa operations and improved earnings of GRUMA. Financial operations increased to $ 75 million for the quarter and $ 79 million for the six months primarily due to improved results of our private equity fund investments and captive insurance operations.
Corporate improved by $ 145 million for the quarter and $ 271 million for the six months primarily due to the Company's $45 million equity share of the gain reported by CIP upon the sale of its Tate & Lyle interest in this year's second quarter and the positive impact of $ 72 million for the quarter and $ 196 million for the six months from the effect of declining commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuations. In addition, last year's quarter and six months included an abandonment charge of $ 14 million.
