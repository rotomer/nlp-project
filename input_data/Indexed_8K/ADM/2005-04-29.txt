Discussion of Operations
 
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were $ 269 million, or $ .41 per share, compared to $ 227 million, or $ .35 per share, last year. Net earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 2005 were $ 849 million, or $ 1.29 per share, compared to $ 598 million, or $ .92 per share, last year. This years results for the quarter and nine months include a gain of $ 114 million ($ 74 million after tax, equal to $ .11 per share) from the sale of the Companys direct share interest in Tate & Lyle. This years results for the nine months also include an after tax gain of $ 45 million ($.07 per share) representing the Companys equity share of the gain reported in the second quarter by its unconsolidated affiliate, CIP, upon the sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle. Last years results for the quarter and nine months included asset abandonment charges of $ 12 million ($ 8 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) and $ 41 million ($ 26 million after tax, equal to $ .04 per share) respectively. Last years results for the quarter and nine months also included a $ 21 million ($ 13 million after tax, equal to $ .02 per share) gain from an insurance-related lawsuit pertaining to the flood of 1993 and an $ 11 million ($ 7 million after tax, equal to $ .01 per share) gain on securities transactions. 
 
Segment Operating profit declined $125 million to $ 377 million for the quarter and declined $ 93 million to $1.2 billion for the nine months.
 
Oilseeds Processing operating profit declined $ 57 million to $ 61 million for the quarter and declined $ 35 million to $ 271 million for the nine months as improved operating results in Europe were offset by decreased operating results in North American and Asian operations. Operating results in South America improved for the quarter but lagged prior year results for the nine months.
 
Corn Processing operating profit declined $ 54 million to $ 178 million for the quarter and declined $ 98 million to $ 413 million for the nine months due principally to higher energy costs and reduced lysine selling prices as compared to last year. In addition, higher average net corn costs negatively impacted the nine month comparison. However, as net corn costs in fiscal 2005 continue to decline, third quarter Corn Processing operating profits increased 35% over second quarter levels. Sweetener and Starches earnings declined $ 12 million to $ 80 million for the quarter due principally to higher energy costs and declined $ 77 million to $ 179 million for the nine months due principally to higher average net corn and energy costs. For the quarter, Bioproducts operating profits declined $ 42 million to $ 98 million as the effect of higher energy costs, lower ethanol sales volumes and lower lysine selling prices more than offset the positive impact of higher ethanol selling prices and lower net corn costs. For the nine months, Bioproducts operating profits decreased $ 21 million to $ 233 million due principally to higher average net corn and energy costs, lower ethanol sales volumes and lower lysine selling prices partially offset by the higher ethanol selling prices.
 
Agricultural Services operating profit of $ 55 million for the quarter and $194 million for the nine months were down slightly from last year levels as improvements in North American origination and transportation operating results were offset by a decline from the prior years strong global grain merchandising results.
 
Other segment operating profit decreased to $ 83 million from $ 97 million for the quarter and increased to $ 322 million from $ 271 million for the nine months. Food and Feed Ingredient earnings of $ 44 million for the quarter declined from prior year levels due principally to reduced results from Cocoa and Natural Health and Nutrition operations. Earnings of Food and Feed Ingredients of $ 204 million for the nine months were comparable to last year. Financial operations increased to $ 40 million for the quarter and $ 119 million for the nine months primarily due to improved results of private equity fund investments. In addition, results of the captive insurance operations improved in the nine month period.

Corporate results for the quarter improved $ 195 million to a profit of $ 32 million from a loss of $ 163 million last year. For the nine months, Corporate results improved $ 466 million to a profit of $ 49 million from a loss of $ 417 million last year. These improvements were related to the current year gains of $ 114 million for the quarter and $ 159 million for the nine months related to the sale of the Companys Tate & Lyle interests. In addition, changing commodity price levels had no impact on LIFO inventory valuation for the current year quarter but rising prices resulted in a $ 99 million LIFO charge last year. For the nine months, declining commodity price levels this year resulted in LIFO income of $ 135 million compared to a LIFO charge of $ 160 million for the nine months last year due to rising price levels.
