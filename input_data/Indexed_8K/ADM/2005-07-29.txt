Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2005 were $ 1.044 billion, or $ 1.59 per share, compared to $ 495 million, or $ .76 per share, last year. Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 were $ 195 million, or $.30 a share, compared to a loss of $ 103 million, or $ .16 per share last year. The quarter and year ended June 30, 2004 included a $ 400 million charge ($ 252 million after tax, or $ .39 per share) related to the settlement of fructose litigation.
Segment operating profit increased $ 83 million to $ 351 million for the quarter and declined $ 10 million to $ 1.551 billion for the year as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except the Corn Processing segment.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 89 million to $ 74 million for the quarter and increased $ 54 million to $ 345 million for the year due to improved operating results in Europe, South America and Asia. Last years operating profit for the quarter and fiscal year were negatively impacted by Chinese contract defaults in the fourth quarter. In addition, results for the fourth quarter and year include a charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets of $13 million. Last years results included abandonment losses of $1 million for the quarter and $4 million for the year.
Corn Processing operating profit declined $ 33 million to $ 117 million for the quarter and declined $ 131 million to $ 530 million for the year due principally to lower lysine selling prices and higher energy costs as compared to last year. Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $ 30 million to $ 92 million for the quarter due to higher sweetener and starch volumes and lower net corn costs partially offset by increased energy costs. For the year, Sweetener and Starch operating profit declined $ 47 million to $ 271 million as higher sweetener and starch selling prices were more than offset by increased energy and net corn costs. Last years fourth quarter and fiscal year results also included a $ 15 million gain from an insurance-related lawsuit. Bioproducts operating profit declined $ 63 million to $ 25 million for the quarter due to lower lysine selling prices and higher energy costs partially offset by lower net corn costs. For the year, Bioproducts operating profit declined $ 84 million to $ 259 million due to lower lysine selling prices and higher average net corn and energy costs. For the year, these declines were partially offset by higher ethanol selling prices. In addition, Bioproducts results for the fourth quarter and year include a charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets of $ 16 million. Last years Bioproducts results included abandonment losses of $ 14 million for the year.
Agricultural Services operating profit increased by $ 23 million to $ 68 million for the quarter due principally to improved grain operations and transportation results. For the year, operating profit increased $ 12 million to $ 262 million as improvements in North American grain and transportation results offset a decline from last years strong global grain merchandising results. Last years Agricultural Services results included abandonment losses of $ 5 million for the year.
Other segment operating profit increased $ 4 million to $ 92 million for the quarter and increased $ 55 million to $ 414 million for the year as both Food and Feed Ingredients and Financial operations showed improvements over last year. Food and Feed Ingredients operating profits of $ 60 million for the quarter and $ 264 million for the year were comparable to last year. In addition, Food and Feed Ingredients results include a charge for abandonment and write-down of long-lived assets of $11 million for the quarter and $13 million for the year. Last years results included abandonment losses of $9 million for the quarter and $13 million for the year. Financial operating profit of $ 32 million for the quarter was comparable to the $ 30 million profit of last year. For the full year, Financial operating earnings increased $ 52 million to $ 151 million primarily due to improved results of captive insurance operations and private equity fund investments.
