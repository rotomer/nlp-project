Discussion of Operations
 
Net earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 were $ 186 million, equal to $ .29 per share, compared to $ 266 million, equal to $ .41 per share last year. Earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 include an after-tax charge of $19 million, equal to $ .03 per share, as a result of the Companys recent adoption of Financial Accounting Standard Number 123 (revised 2004) requiring the acceleration of share-based compensation expense into this quarter relating to grants issued to retirement-eligible employees pursuant to the Companys Incentive Compensation Plan.
Segment operating profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased $ 12 million to $ 351 million as operating profit improvements were realized in all major segments except Agricultural Services.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 8 million to $ 99 million for the quarter as improved South America, Europe and Asia operating results were partially offset by decreased operating results of our North America operations.
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 33 million to $ 136 million for the quarter due principally to lower net corn costs partially offset by lower lysine selling prices and higher energy costs. Sweeteners and Starches results increased $ 37 million to $ 92 million for the quarter due principally to lower net corn costs partially offset by higher energy costs. Bioproducts results declined $ 4 million to $ 44 million for the quarter due primarily to lower lysine selling prices, lower citric acid operating results and higher energy costs partially offset by lower net corn costs and increased ethanol sales volumes.
Agricultural Services operating profits declined $ 31 million to $ 20 million for the quarter due to a decline in global grain merchandising results and the negative impact of hurricanes on North American origination and export operating results. These declines were partially offset by improved operating results of transportation operations.
Other segment operating earnings increased to $ 95 million from $ 93 million last year due to improved operating results of Financial operations partially offset by a decline in operating results of Food and Feed Ingredient operations. Financial operating results increased $ 22 million to $ 26 million for the quarter due principally to improved results of insurance operations. Food and Feed Ingredient results declined to $ 69 million from $ 89 million last year as operating results of the natural health and nutrition, cocoa, and wheat product lines declined from last years levels.
Significant components of Corporate results are as follows (in millions)
