Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 were $ 348 million, or $ .53 per share, compared to
$ 269 million, or $ .41 per share, last year. Net earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 were
$ 902 million, or $ 1.38 per share, compared to $ 849 million, or $ 1.29 per share, last year. This years nine month results include a $ 36 million tax credit related to the adjustment of state and federal income taxes, securities gains of $ 29 million ($ 18 million after tax), Brazilian transactional tax credits of $19 million ($12 million after tax), asset impairment charges of $ 36 million ($ 22 million after tax), and a charge of $ 22 million related to costs associated with a citric acid plant shut down and an exit from the European animal feed business. Net earnings for the quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2005 included a gain of $ 114 million ($ 74 million after tax) from the sale of the Companys direct interest in Tate & Lyle. Last years results for the nine months also included an after-tax gain of $ 45 million representing the Companys equity share of the gain reported by its unconsolidated subsidiary, CIP, upon the sale of its interest in Tate & Lyle.
Segment operating profit increased $ 173 million to $ 549 million for the quarter and increased $ 224 million to $ 1.4 billion for the nine months.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 116 million to $ 177 million for the quarter and increased $ 133 million to $ 404 million for the nine months as improved global market conditions resulted in improved operating results in North America, South America, Europe and Asia.
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 41 million to $ 219 million for the quarter and increased
$ 179 million to $ 591 million for the nine months reflecting improved starch, sweetener and ethanol selling prices and lower net corn costs. Sweeteners and Starches operating profits increased $ 33 million to $ 113 million for the quarter and increased $ 140 million to $ 320 million for the nine months due to lower net corn costs and increased sweetener and starch selling prices, partially offset by higher energy costs. Bioproducts operating profits increased $ 7 million to $ 105 million for the quarter and increased
$ 38 million to $ 271 million for the nine months due to lower net corn costs and higher ethanol selling prices, partially offset by increased energy costs. For the quarter, ethanol sales volumes declined versus year-ago levels as last years volumes included a draw-down of ethanol stocks which were built up in anticipation of new markets. For the nine months, Bioproducts operating profit improved as increased ethanol sales volumes were partially offset by lower lysine selling prices and $ 20 million of employee severance costs associated with the closure of a citric acid plant.
Agricultural Services operating profit increased $ 24 million to $ 79 million for the quarter due principally to improved operating results of transportation operations. For the nine months operating profits decreased $ 2 million to $ 192 million as improved results from transportation operations were offset by a decline in global grain merchandising operations and the negative impact of hurricanes on North American origination and export operating results.
Other segment operating profit decreased $ 8 million to $ 76 million for the quarter due principally to decreased results of Food and Feed Ingredients related principally to costs associated with exiting the European animal feed business. Financial results for the quarter were comparable to last year as an $ 18 million reduction in earnings of the Companys private equity fund investments was offset by improved earnings of ADM Investor Services and captive insurance operations. For the nine months, Other segment operating profit declined $ 86 million to $ 236 million. Food and Feed Ingredient operations declined $ 65 million due principally to impairment charges of $ 32 million, decreased operating results of natural health and nutrition, and costs associated with exiting the European animal feed business. Financial results declined $ 21 million primarily due to a $ 63 million decrease in earnings of our private  
equity funds partially offset by improved earnings of ADM Investor Services and captive insurance operations.
