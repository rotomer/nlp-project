Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 15, 2007, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") under which it agreed to sell $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 0.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes") to Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"). The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, are expected to be approximately $1.134 billion. A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Purchase Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on February 22, 2007. The Notes and the shares of the Company's common stock without par value (the "Common Stock"), issuable in certain circumstances upon conversion of the Notes, have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of February 22, 2007 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"). A copy of the Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the descriptions of the Indenture and the Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture and Notes, respectively.
The Notes will be convertible into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock based on a conversion rate of 22.8343 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $43.79 per share), subject to adjustment, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2007 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing price of the Common Stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 140% of the applicable conversion price per share, which is $1,000 divided by the then applicable conversion rate; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the "Note Measurement Period") in which the average trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the notes was equal to or less than 98% of the average conversion value of the notes during the Note Measurement Period; (3) if specified distributions to holders of the Common Stock are made or specified corporate transactions occur, as set forth in the Indenture; and (4) at any time on or after January 15, 2014, through the business day preceding the stated maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder will receive for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000 and (ii) the conversion value, determined in the manner set forth in the Indenture. If the
Table of Contents
conversion value exceeds $1,000 on the conversion date, the Company will also deliver, at its election, cash or Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock for the conversion value in excess of $1,000.
The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2007. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2014.
The holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a change in control, as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The Notes will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness and effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of its subsidiaries' obligations (including secured and unsecured obligations) and effectively subordinated in right of payment to its secured obligations to the extent of the assets securing such obligation.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of February 22, 2007, with the Initial Purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective within 220 days after the closing of the offering of the Notes, a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the Notes and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. The Company will use its reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement effective for a period of two years after the closing of the offering of the Notes or until the earlier of (i) the sale or transfer pursuant to a shelf registration statement of all of the Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, and (ii) the date when holders (other than holders that are the Company's "affiliates") of the Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes are able to sell all such securities immediately without restriction. The Company will be required to pay additional interest, subject to some limitations, to the holders of the Notes if it fails to comply with its obligations to register the Notes and the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Registration Rights Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its Common Stock (the "Purchased Call Options") with Citibank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, and Merrill Lynch International. The Purchased Call Options will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 26.3 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The Company paid an aggregate amount of approximately $299 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes for the Purchased Call Options. Merrill Lynch International's performance under the convertible note hedge transactions is guaranteed by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
Table of Contents
The Company also entered into separate warrant transactions whereby the Company has sold to the Dealers warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 26.3 million shares of Common Stock (the "Sold Warrants") at a strike price of $62.56 per share of Common Stock. The Sold Warrants will be exercisable and will expire in May and June of 2014. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $170 million from the sale of the Sold Warrants. Merrill Lynch International's performance under the warrant transactions is guaranteed by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.
The Purchased Call Options and Sold Warrants are separate contracts entered into by the Company with each of the Dealers, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes. The Purchased Call Options are expected to offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Common Stock at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the Purchased Call Options, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is simultaneously subject to certain customary adjustments.
If the market value per share of the Common Stock at the time of conversion of the Notes is above the strike price of the Purchased Call Options, the Purchased Call Options entitle the Company to receive from the Dealers net shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, depending on the consideration paid on the underlying Notes, based on the excess of the then current market price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Purchased Call Options. Additionally, if the market price of the Common Stock at the time of exercise of the Sold Warrants exceeds the strike price of the Sold Warrants, the Company will owe the Dealers net shares of Common Stock or cash, not offset by the Purchased Call Options, in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of the Common Stock over the strike price of the Sold Warrants.
These transactions will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Notes to $62.56 per share of Common Stock, representing a 75% premium based on the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $35.75 per share on February 15, 2007.
The Sold Warrants and the underlying Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Sold Warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On February 22, 2007, the Company issued $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2007. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2014.
The holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a change in control, as defined in the Indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a change in control, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On February 15, 2007, the Company agreed to sell $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $1.134 billion. The Initial Purchasers received an aggregate commission of $15.5 million in connection with the offering of the Notes.
The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.

     A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company satisfactory in form and substance to the retiring Trustee and the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
     If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     The resignation or removal of a Trustee shall not diminish, impair or terminate its rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.07 as they relate to periods prior to such resignation or removal.

     SECTION 7.10. If the Trustee has or shall acquire any conflicting interest within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the TIA, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the TIA and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by the TIA, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest with respect to the Securities by virtue of being a trustee under the Indenture dated as of June 1, 1986 between the Company and The Bank of New York (as successor to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as trustee, and the Indenture dated as of September 20, 2006 between the Company and The Bank of New York (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as trustee.

If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of federal, state, territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section 7.11, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

     SECTION 10.01. A Holder of a Security may convert such Security at any time during the applicable period stated in paragraph 6 of the Securities upon the occurrence of any of the events set forth in paragraph 6 of the Securities, subject to the provisions of this Article X. Subject to certain exceptions described in paragraph 6 of the Securities and Section 10.22, if a Holder surrenders its Securities for conversion, such Holder will receive, in respect of each $1,000 of Principal Amount, the Conversion Value which shall be paid as follows:
Conversion Privilege.
     (a) cash in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) $1,000 and (2) the Conversion Value (the ""); and
Required Cash Amount
 
     (b) if the Conversion Value is greater than $1,000, a number of shares of Common Stock (the ""), equal to the sum of the Daily Share Amounts for each of the fifteen consecutive Trading Days in the Conversion Reference Period, appropriately adjusted in accordance with this Article X to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar events occurring during the Conversion Reference Period, subject to the right of the Company to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such Remaining Shares as described in this Section 10.01.
Remaining Shares
     On any day prior to the first Trading Day of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, the Company may specify a percentage of the Daily Share Amount that will be settled in cash (the "") and will promptly deliver, in accordance with Section 12.02, written notice thereof to the Trustee, who will promptly thereafter give a copy of such notice to the Conversion Agent and the Holders (the ""). If the Company elects to specify a Cash Percentage, the amount of cash that the Company will deliver in respect of each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period will equal the product of: (1) the Cash Percentage, (2) the Daily Share Amount for such Trading Day, and (3) the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for such Trading Day (that after the consummation of a Change in Control in which the consideration is comprised entirely of cash, the amount used in this clause (3) will be the cash price per share of Common Stock received by holders of Common Stock in such Change in Control). The number of shares deliverable in respect of each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period will be a percentage of the Daily Share Amount equal to 100% minus the Cash Percentage. If the Company does not specify a Cash Percentage by the start of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, the Company shall settle 100% of the Daily Share Amount for each Trading Day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period with shares of Common Stock; , that the Company will pay cash in lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable upon conversion of such Security, pursuant to Section 10.03 hereof. The Company may, at its option, revoke any Cash Percentage Notice through written notice to the Trustee prior to the start of the applicable Conversion Reference Period, who will promptly thereafter give a copy of such notice to the Conversion Agent and the Holders.
Cash Percentage
Cash Percentage Notice
provided
provided, however
     A Holder may convert a portion of the Principal Amount of a Security if the portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion of a portion of a Security.
     In the event of a stock split, combination, dividend or any other event resulting in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Sections 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 or 10.10, during the applicable Conversion Reference Period, appropriate adjustment to the equation for calculating Conversion Value shall be made, as determined by the Board of Directors.
     Promptly after the Company has determined the amount of cash and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered with respect to each $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities that have been presented to the Conversion Agent for conversion, the Company shall give the Trustee and the Conversion Agent notice thereof.
 
     Whenever any event described in paragraph 6(a), paragraph 6(b) or paragraph 6(c) of the Securities shall occur such that the Securities become convertible as provided in this Article X, the Company shall (x) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (y) promptly deliver, in accordance with Section 12.02, written notice of the convertibility of the Securities to the Holders, which press release, website posting, public disclosure or written notice, as the case may be, shall include:
     (a) a description of such event;
     (b) a description of the periods during which the Securities shall be convertible as provided in paragraph 6(a), paragraph 6(b) or paragraph 6(c) of the Securities as a result of such event;
     (c) a statement of whether an adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall take effect in respect of such event pursuant to Section 10.11; and
     (d) the procedures Holders must follow to convert their Securities in accordance with this Article X, including the name and address of the Conversion Agent.
     SECTION 10.02. To convert a Security, a Holder must satisfy the requirements in paragraph 6 of the Securities. The Conversion Agent shall, within one (1) Business Day of a Conversion Date, provide notice to the Company as set forth in Section 12.02(b) of the Principal Amount of Securities that have been converted with respect to such Conversion Date.
Conversion Procedure.
     As promptly as practicable following the last day of the Conversion Reference Period applicable to the Securities being converted, the Company shall deliver to the Holder of the Security being converted, through the Conversion Agent, the Required Cash Amount and Net Share Amount, if any (including cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 10.03 hereof). The person in whose name the certificate representing any shares is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; , that a Conversion Date on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall not be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to receive the Net Share Amount upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but shall be effective to constitute the person or persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the Close of Business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date, even if the stock transfer books of the Company are closed. Upon conversion of a Security, the Holder thereof shall no longer be a Holder of such Security.
provided, however
     No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on, or other distributions with respect to, any Common Stock except as provided in this Article X. On conversion of a Security, accrued interest with respect to the converted Security shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full to the Holder thereof through delivery of the Required Cash Amount and the Net Share Amount, if any (together with the cash payment, if
 
any, in lieu of fractional shares) in exchange for the Security being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.
     If the Holder converts more than one Security at the same time, the Required Cash Amount and the Net Share Amount, if any (together with the cash payment, if any, in lieu of fractional shares) shall be based on the total Principal Amount of the Securities converted.
     If the last day on which a Security may be converted is a Legal Holiday, the Security may be surrendered on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday.
     Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder, a new Security in an authorized denomination equal in Principal Amount to the unconverted portion of the Security surrendered.
     SECTION 10.03. The Company will not issue a fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of a Security. Instead, the Company will deliver cash for the current market value of the fractional share. The current market value of a fractional share shall equal the arithmetic average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the Common Stock for each of the fifteen consecutive Trading Days of the Conversion Reference Period, rounded to the nearest whole cent.
Fractional Shares.
     SECTION 10.04. If a Holder converts a Security, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon the conversion. However, the Holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the Holder requests the shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Conversion Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be delivered in a name other than the Holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
Taxes on Conversion.
     SECTION 10.05. The Company shall, prior to the Issue Date, and from time to time as may be necessary, reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to permit the payment of the Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of the Securities.
Company to Provide Stock.
     All shares of Common Stock delivered upon payment of any Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of the Securities shall be newly issued shares or treasury shares, shall be duly and validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.
     The Company will comply with all federal and state securities laws regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon payment of any Remaining Shares, if applicable, upon conversion of Securities, if any, and will list or cause to have quoted such shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market or such other market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
 
     SECTION 10.06. If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company:
Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock.
     (a) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock payable in shares of its Common Stock or shares of its Capital Stock;
     (b) subdivides or combines its shares of Common Stock; or
     (c) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of its Capital Stock (other than rights, warrants or options for its Capital Stock),
then the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holder of a Security thereafter converted may receive the number of shares of Capital Stock of the Company which such Holder would have owned immediately following such action if such Holder had converted the Security immediately prior to such action.
     The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.
     If after an adjustment a Holder of a Security upon conversion of such Security may receive shares of two or more classes of Capital Stock of the Company, the Conversion Rate shall thereafter be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of an action taken with respect to any such class of Capital Stock as is contemplated by this Article X with respect to the Common Stock, on terms comparable to those applicable to Common Stock in this Article X.
     SECTION 10.07. If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes any rights, warrants or options to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Average Closing Price, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
Adjustment for Rights Issue.
where,
R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
R = the current Conversion Rate.
O = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 is being applied.
N = the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered pursuant to the distribution.
 
P = the offering price per share of the additional shares.
M = the Average Closing Price, minus, in the case of (i) a distribution to which Section 10.06(c) applies or (ii) a distribution to which Section 10.08 applies, for which, in each case, (x) the record date shall occur on or before the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 applies and (y) the Ex-Dividend Time shall occur on or after the date of the first public announcement for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 applies, the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.07 applies) of the
     (a) Capital Stock of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.06(c) distribution and
     (b) assets of the Company or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.08 distribution.
     The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 10.07.
     In the event the Company makes a distribution pursuant to this Section 10.07 the Company will be required to give notice to the holders of Securities at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date, as defined below, for such distribution.
     The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the rights, warrants or options to which this Section 10.07 applies. If all of the shares of Common Stock subject to such rights, warrants or options have not been issued when such rights, warrants or options expire, then the Conversion Rate shall promptly be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the issuance of such rights, warrants or options been made on the basis of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of such rights, warrants or options.
     No adjustment shall be made under this Section 10.07 if the application of the formula stated above in this Section 10.07 would result in a value of R' that is equal to or less than the value of R.
     SECTION 10.08. .
Adjustment for Other Distributions
     (a) If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assets (excluding distributions of Capital Stock or equity interests referred to in Section 10.08(b)), or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company (including securities or cash, but excluding (x) distributions of Capital Stock referred to in Section 10.06 and distributions of rights, warrants or options referred to in Section 10.07 and (y) cash dividends or other cash distributions referred to in Section 10.09), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted, subject to the provisions of Section 10.08(c), in accordance with the formula:
 
where,
R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
R = the current Conversion Rate.
M = the Average Closing Price, minus, in the case of a distribution to which Section 10.06(a) applies, for which (i) the record date shall occur on or before the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies and (ii) the Ex-Dividend Time shall occur on or after the date of the Time of Determination for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies, the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies) of any Capital Stock of the Company distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in such Section 10.06(a) distribution.
F = the fair market value (on the record date for the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies) of the assets, securities, rights, warrants or options to be distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock in the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) is being applied (including, in the case of cash dividends or other cash distributions giving rise to an adjustment under this Section 10.08(a), all such cash distributed concurrently).
     The Board of Directors shall determine fair market values for the purposes of this Section 10.08(a).
     The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive the distribution to which this Section 10.08(a) applies.
     (b) If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company pays a dividend or makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock consisting of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
where,
R' = the adjusted Conversion Rate.
R = the current Conversion Rate.
M = the average of the Post-Distribution Prices of the Common Stock for the fifteen Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the date on which "ex-dividend
 
trading" commences for such dividend or distribution on the principal United States exchange or market which such securities are then listed or quoted (the "").
Ex-Dividend Date
F = the fair market value of the securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock for which this Section 10.08(b) is being applied and shall mean the number of securities distributed in respect of each share of Common Stock multiplied by the average of the Post-Distribution Prices of those securities distributed for the fifteen Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date.
     "" of Capital Stock or any similar equity interest on any date means the closing per unit price (or, if no closing price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date for trading of such units on a "when issued" basis without due bills (or similar concept) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which such Capital Stock or equity interest is traded or, if the Capital Stock or equity interest, as the case may be, is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated; that if on any date such units have not traded on a "when issued" basis, the Post-Distribution Price shall be the closing per unit price (or, if no closing price is reported, the average of the bid and ask prices or, if more than one in either case, the average of the average bid and the average ask prices) on such date for trading of such units on a "regular way" basis without due bills (or similar concept) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which such Capital Stock or equity interest is traded or, if the Capital Stock or equity interest, as the case may be, is not listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System or by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated. In the absence of such quotation, the Company shall be entitled to determine the Post-Distribution Price on the basis of such quotations which reflect the post-distribution value of the Capital Stock or equity interests as it considers appropriate.
Post-Distribution Price
provided
     (c) In the event that, with respect to any distribution to which Section 10.08(a) would otherwise apply, the difference "M-F" as defined in the formula set forth in Section 10.08(a) is less than $1.00 or "F" is equal to or greater than "M", then the adjustment provided by Section 10.08(a) shall not be made and in lieu thereof the provisions of Section 10.16 shall apply to such distribution.
     (d) In the event the Company makes a distribution pursuant to this Section 10.08 which has a per share value equal to more than 15% of the Closing Price of shares of Common Stock on the day preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Company will be required to give notice to the holders of Securities at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
     SECTION 10.09. If, after the Issue Date of the Securities, the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any cash (excluding (a) any quarterly cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock to the extent
Adjustment for Cash Dividends.
 
that such dividend equals $0.115 per share, as adjusted in the manner specified below (the ""), (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in Section 10.08, (c) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, and (d) distributions described in Section 10.10, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
Dividend Threshold Amount

C = the amount in cash per share that the Company distributes to holders of the Common Stock.
     If the Company fails to pay a cash dividend or distribution for a period in which a regularly scheduled quarterly dividend has previously been paid in accordance with past practice, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted using the formula in this Section 10.09, with the Ex-Dividend Date being deemed to be the second to last Trading Day in the second month of the calendar quarter in question, and "C" being deemed to be zero.
     SECTION 10.10. If, after the Issue Date, the Company makes a payment of cash or other consideration by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to holders of Common Stock in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer, other than an odd-lot offer, for the Common Stock, and the value of the sum of (i) the aggregate cash and other consideration paid for such Common Stock, and (ii) the aggregate fair market value of any consideration paid for the purchase of Common Stock in respect of a tender offer or exchange

offer, other than an odd-lot offer, within the twelve (12) months preceding the date of purchase of such shares of Common Stock in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.10 previously has been made, expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer, exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately following the last time (the "") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to the tender or exchange offer, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:
Expiration Time
where,
R' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Expiration Time;
R = the Conversion Rate in effect on the Expiration Time;
F = the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors) of the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration paid or payable for shares of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the "");
Purchased Shares
O = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Time less any Purchased Shares;
O' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Time, including any Purchased Shares; and
P = the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time.
Such increase (if any) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Company is prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. If the application of this Section 10.10 to any tender or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender or exchange offer under this Section 10.10.
     SECTION 10.11. If, after the Issue Date, a Change in Control occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Securities in connection with such Change in Control, the Company will increase the Applicable Conversion Rate for the Securities surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described in this Section 10.11. A conversion of Securities will be deemed for the purposes of this Section 10.11 to be "in connection with" a
Adjustment to Conversion Rate Upon Change in Control Transactions.
Make-Whole Shares
 
Change in Control transaction if the notice of conversion of the Securities is received by the Conversion Agent from and including the effective date of the Change in Control, up to and including the Trading Day prior to the related Change in Control Purchase Date.
     The number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by reference to the table below and is based on the date which such Change in Control transaction becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction. If the holders of Common Stock receive only cash in the Change in Control transaction, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share of Common Stock. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock on the fifteen consecutive Trading Days up to but excluding the Change in Control Effective Date.
Change in Control Effective Date
Stock Price
     The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices will equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Applicable Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Make-Whole Shares set forth in the table below will be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as the Conversion Rate.
     If the exact Stock Prices and Change in Control Effective Dates are not set forth in the table, then: (a) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Change in Control Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the Make-Whole Shares issued upon conversion of the Securities will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates in the table, based on a 365-day year, (b) if the Stock Price exceeds $150.00 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Securities; and (c) if the Stock Price is less than $35.75 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth herein, no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Securities.
 
     SECTION 10.12. No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate. Any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate shall be carried forward and taken into account in determining any subsequent adjustment. In addition, the Company shall make and pay any carry forward adjustments not otherwise effected upon conversion of a Security on the earlier of the Change in Control Purchase Date and the date five Business Days prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
When Adjustment May Be Deferred.
     SECTION 10.13. No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09, 10.10 or 10.16 if Holders are to participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. Such participation by Holders may include participation upon conversion; that an adjustment shall be made at such time as the Holders are no longer entitled to participate.
When No Adjustment Required; Conversion Rate Cap.
provided
     No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest.
     No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.
     To the extent the Securities become convertible pursuant to this Article X into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will not accrue on the cash.
     Further, notwithstanding anything in Article X, the Conversion Rate shall not exceed 27.9720 per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities other than as a result of proportional adjustments to the Conversion Rate described in Sections 10.06, 10.07 and 10.08.
     SECTION 10.14. Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Holders a notice of the adjustment. The Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent such notice and an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment is correct. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate except to exhibit the same to any Holder desiring inspection thereof.
Notice of Adjustment.
     All calculations under this Article X shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/1,000th of a share, as the case may be (with one-half cent and 5/10,000ths of a share being rounded upward).
     SECTION 10.15. . If:
Notice of Certain Transactions
     (a) the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09, 10.10 or 10.11 (unless no adjustment is to occur pursuant to Section 10.13); or
 
     (b) the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 10.16; or
     (c) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company;
then the Company shall mail to Holders and file with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent a notice stating the proposed record date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, transfer, liquidation or dissolution. The Company shall file and mail the notice at least 15 days (10 days in the case of a cash dividend that would require an adjustment under Section 10.09) before such date. Failure to file or mail the notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of the transaction.
     SECTION 10.16. If the Company is a party to a transaction subject to Section 5.01 (other than a sale, transfer or lease of the assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in a transaction in which the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to such transaction do not receive securities, cash or other assets of the Company or any other person) or a merger or binding share exchange which reclassifies or changes the outstanding Common Stock of the Company, the person obligated to deliver securities, cash or other assets upon conversion of Securities shall enter into a supplemental indenture. If the issuer of securities deliverable upon conversion of Securities is an Affiliate of the successor Company, that issuer shall join in the supplemental indenture.
Reorganization of Company; Special Distributions.
     The supplemental indenture shall provide that after the effective time of the transaction, settlement of the Conversion Value will be based on the kind and amount of cash, securities or other assets of the Company or another Person that a holder of Common Stock received in such transaction; that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Value will be paid in cash and at the Company's election, cash, securities or a combination of cash and securities in accordance with the terms of this Article X. If the holders of Common Stock of the Company have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, then from and after the effective date of such transaction, the Securities shall be convertible into the consideration that the majority of the holders of Common Stock of the Company who made such an election received in such transaction. The supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in this Article X. The successor Company shall mail to Holders a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture.
provided
     If this Section applies, neither Section 10.06 nor 10.07 applies. If the Company makes a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock of any of its assets, or debt securities or any rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company that, but for the provisions of Section 10.08(c), would otherwise result in an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.08, then, from and after the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution, a Holder of a Security that converts such Security in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture shall upon such conversion be entitled to receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock into which the Security is convertible, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets comprising the distribution
 
that such Holder would have received if such Holder had converted the Security immediately prior to the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the distribution.
     SECTION 10.17. . Any determination that the Company or the Board of Directors must make pursuant to Section 10.01, 10.03, 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.16 or 10.19 is conclusive.
Company Determination Final
     SECTION 10.18. The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article X should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The Trustee has no duty to determine whether a supplemental indenture under Section 10.16 need be entered into or whether any provisions of any supplemental indenture are correct. The Trustee shall not be accountable for and makes no representation as to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with this Article X or paragraph 6 of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall be responsible for determining whether any event contemplated by paragraph 6 of the Securities has occurred that makes the Securities eligible for conversion or no longer eligible therefor until the Company has delivered to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent the notices referred to in said paragraph 6 with respect to the commencement or termination of such conversion rights, on which notices the Trustee and the Conversion Agent may conclusively rely, and the Company agrees to deliver such notices to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent immediately after the occurrence of any such event or at such other times as shall be provided for in said paragraph. Each Conversion Agent shall have the same protection under this Section 10.18 as the Trustee.
Trustee's Adjustment Disclaimer.
     SECTION 10.19. In the event that this Article X requires adjustments to the Conversion Rate under more than one of Sections 10.06(c), 10.07, 10.08 or 10.09, and the record dates for the distributions giving rise to such adjustments shall occur on the same date, then such adjustments shall be made by applying, first, the provisions of Section 10.06(c), second, the provisions of Section 10.08, third, the provisions of Section 10.09 and, fourth, the provisions of 10.07.
Simultaneous Adjustments.
     SECTION 10.20. After an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Article X, any subsequent event requiring an adjustment under this Article X shall cause an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as so adjusted.
Successive Adjustments.
     SECTION 10.21. If the Company pays withholding taxes on behalf of a Holder as a result of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate, the Company may, at its option, set off such payments against payments of cash and Common Stock on the Securities.

     SECTION 10.22. .
Exchange in Lieu of Conversion
     (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, when a Holder surrenders Securities for conversion, the Company may direct the Conversion Agent to surrender, on or prior to the commencement of the relevant Conversion Reference Period, such Securities to a financial institution designated by the Company (which may not be an Affiliate of
 
the Company; provided that, for purposes of this Section 10.22, an "Affiliate" shall include any Person with direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the equity of the Company or the power, direct or indirect, to vote more than 10% of the securities having ordinary voting power for the election of directors of the Company) (a "") for exchange in lieu of conversion. The Company may, but is not required to, pay customary and reasonable fees in connection with the exchange.
Financial Institution
     (b) In order to accept any such Securities surrendered for conversion, the Financial Institution must agree to deliver, in exchange for such Securities, all cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Value, at the option of the Financial Institution, all in accordance with Section 10.01.
     (c) By the Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the start of the Conversion Reference Period, the Company must notify the Holder surrendering Securities for conversion that it has directed the Conversion Agent to surrender such Securities to a Financial Institution for exchange in lieu of conversion and such Financial Institution must notify the Conversion Agent whether it will deliver, upon exchange, cash or a specified combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.
     (d) If the Financial Institution accepts any such Securities, it will deliver the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination thereof, to the Conversion Agent and the Conversion Agent will deliver those shares of Common Stock or cash or combination thereof, as the case may be, to the Holder. Any Securities exchanged by such Financial Institution will remain outstanding.
     (e) If such Financial Institution agrees to accept any Securities for exchange but does not timely deliver the related consideration, or if such Financial Institution does not accept the Securities for exchange, the Company will, as promptly as practical thereafter, but not later than the third Business Day following the determination of the Conversion Value, convert the Securities into cash and shares, if any, of Common Stock, pursuant to Section 10.02.
     (f) The Company will not provide to the Financial Institution, directly or indirectly, any of such consideration delivered by the Financial Institution in exchange for such Securities.
     In no event will the Company's designation of a Financial Institution pursuant to this Section 10.22 require such Financial Institution to accept any Securities for exchange. The Company shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to, or otherwise enter into any agreement or arrangement with, a Financial Institution for or with respect to such designation pursuant to this Section 10.22.
     SECTION 10.23. . Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities pursuant to this Article X shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any shareholder rights plan adopted by the Company, as the same may be amended from time to time. If at the time of conversion, however, the rights have separated from the shares of Common

Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement so that the Holders of the Securities would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted pursuant to Section 10.08(a), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.
     SECTION 11.01. Interest on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the person in whose name that Security is registered at the Close of Business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose. Each installment of interest on any Security shall be paid in same-day funds by transfer to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States, if the Trustee shall have received proper wire transfer instructions from such payee not later than the related Regular Record Date or, if no such instructions have been received, by check mailed to the payee at its address set forth on the Registrar's books. In the case of a Global Security, interest payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Depositary for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the payment received by it in respect of such Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.
Interest Payments.
     SECTION 11.02. Any interest on any Security that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, within 30 days following any Interest Payment Date (herein called "", which term shall include any accrued and unpaid interest that has accrued on such defaulted amount in accordance with paragraph 1 of the Securities), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below.
Defaulted Interest.
Defaulted Interest
          (a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the persons in whose names the Securities are registered at the Close of Business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date
 
and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder at such Holder's address as it appears on the Registrar's security register not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names the Securities are registered at the Close of Business on such special record date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (b).
          (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
The Bank of New York, as Trustee, certifies that this is one of the Securities referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
1. Interest.
     This Security shall bear cash interest at the rate of 0.875% per annum. Interest on this Security shall accrue from February 22, 2007, or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest shall be payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2007 (each such day, an "Interest Payment Date"), to the holder of record hereof at the Close of Business on the February 1 or August 1, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Each payment of cash interest on this Security shall include interest accrued for the period commencing on and including the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if none, February 22, 2007) through the day before the applicable Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity Date or Change in Control Purchase Date, as the case may be. Any payment required to be made on any day that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period on the payment so deferred. Interest shall be calculated using a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. Interest shall cease to accrue on this Security upon its Stated Maturity Date, conversion (except as otherwise provided herein) or purchase by the Company at the option of the Holder upon a Change in Control in accordance with paragraph 5 hereof.
     If the Principal Amount hereof or any portion of such Principal Amount is not paid when due (whether upon acceleration pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture, upon the date set for payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price pursuant to paragraph 5 hereof or upon the Stated Maturity Date of this Security) or if interest (including Additional Interest, if any) due hereon or any portion of such interest is not paid when due in accordance with this paragraph or paragraph 5 or 7 hereof, then in each such case the overdue amount shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear interest at the rate of 0.875% per annum, compounded semiannually, which interest shall accrue from the date such overdue amount was originally due to the date payment of such amount, including interest thereon, has been made or duly provided for.
2. Method of Payment.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make payments in respect of Change in Control Purchase Prices and at the Stated Maturity Date to Holders who surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Securities. The Company will pay any cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. The Company may make such cash payments by check payable in such money or, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, by wire transfer.
 
3. Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar.
     Initially, The Bank of New York will act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without notice, other than notice to The Bank of New York. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent, Registrar or co-registrar.

The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect from time to time (the ""). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement of those terms.
Indenture
Trustee
TIA
     The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company limited to $1,150,000,000 aggregate Principal Amount (subject to Section 2.07 of the Indenture). The Indenture does not limit other indebtedness of the Company, secured or unsecured.
5. Purchase by the Company at the Option of the Holder upon a Change in Control.
     At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to purchase the Securities held by such Holder no later than 35 Business Days after the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company for a change in control purchase price equal to the Principal Amount of the Securities to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Change in Control Purchase Date (the "Change in Control Purchase Price"), unless the Change in Control Purchase Date is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Interest Payment Date to which it relates, in which case interest accrued to the Interest Payment Date will be paid to Holders of the Securities as of the preceding Regular Record Date, which Change in Control Purchase Price shall be paid in cash.
     Holders have the right to withdraw any Change in Control Purchase Notice by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
     If cash sufficient to pay the Change in Control Purchase Price of all Securities or portions thereof to be purchased as of the Change in Control Purchase Date is deposited with the Paying Agent on or prior to the third Business Day following the Change in Control Purchase Date, interest shall cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions thereof) immediately after such Change in Control Purchase Date whether or not the Security is delivered to the Paying Agent, and the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Change in Control Purchase Price and accrued and unpaid interest upon surrender of such Security).
 
6. Conversion.
     A Holder of a Security may convert such Security into cash and, at the option of the Company, shares of Common Stock of the Company during the periods specified below, if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
     (a) . During any calendar quarter commencing at any time after March 31, 2007, and only during such calendar quarter, if the Closing Price of the Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the preceding calendar quarter exceeds 140% of the Conversion Price per share on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter. The Company will determine at or prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter commencing at any time after March 31, 2007 whether the Securities are convertible as a result of the price of the Common Stock and shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Conversion Agent thereof. Upon determining that the Holders are entitled to convert their Securities in accordance with the provisions described in the Indenture on account of this subsection (a), the Company will promptly (1) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise publicly disclose this information or (2) provide notice to the Holders in a manner contemplated by the Indenture, including through the facilities of DTC.
Conversion Based on Common Stock Price
     (b) . During the five (5) consecutive Business Days immediately after any five (5) consecutive Trading Day period (such five (5) consecutive Trading Day period, the "") in which the average Trading Price (calculated using the Trading Price for each of the Trading Days in the Note Measurement Period) per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities was equal to or less than ninety-eight percent (98%) of the average Conversion Value during the Note Measurement Period (the ""). The Bid Solicitation Agent shall not have any obligation to determine the Trading Price unless the Company has requested such determination, and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a Holder of at least five million dollars ($5,000,000) in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities would be equal to or less than ninety-eight percent (98%) of the Conversion Value. Upon receipt of such evidence, the Company shall instruct the Bid Solicitation Agent to determine the Trading Price per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities for each of the five (5) successive Trading Days immediately after the Company receives such evidence and on each Trading Day thereafter until the first Trading Day on which the Trading Price Condition is no longer satisfied. For purposes of this paragraph, the "Conversion Value" per $1,000 Principal Amount of Securities, on a given Trading Day, means the product of the Closing Price on such Trading Day and the Conversion Rate in effect on such Trading Day. Promptly after the Securities become convertible into cash and, if applicable, Common Stock in accordance with this clause (b) and promptly after the Securities become no longer so convertible in accordance with this clause (b), the Company shall give the Conversion Agent and the Trustee notice thereof. Upon determining that the Holders are entitled to convert their Securities in accordance with the provisions described in the Indenture on account of this subsection (b), the Company will promptly (1) issue a press release and use its reasonable efforts to post such information on its website or otherwise
Conversion Based on Trading Price

Trading Price Condition
 
publicly disclose this information or (2) provide notice to the Holders in a manner contemplated by the Indenture, including through the facilities of DTC.
     Except as described below, the "" as referred to in this subsection (b), of the Securities on any day means the average secondary market bid quotations obtained by the Bid Solicitation Agent for $5,000,000 Principal Amount of Securities at approximately 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on such day from three independent nationally recognized securities dealers to be selected by the Company. However, if the Bid Solicitation Agent can reasonably obtain only two such bids, then the average of the two bids will instead be used, and if the Bid Solicitation Agent can reasonably obtain only one such bid, then that one bid will be used. Even still, if on any given day: (a) the Bid Solicitation Agent cannot reasonably obtain at least one bid for $5,000,000 Principal Amount of Securities from an independent nationally recognized securities dealer; or (b) in the Company's reasonable, good faith judgment, the bid quotation or quotations that the Bid Solicitation Agent has obtained are not indicative of the secondary market value of the Securities, then the Trading Price per $1,000 Principal Amount of the Securities will be deemed to be equal to 98% of the average Conversion Value of the Securities in effect on that day.
Trading Price,
     (c) .
Conversion Upon Occurrence of Specified Corporate Transactions
     (i) During the period specified below, if the Company elects to distribute to all holders of Common Stock (i) rights or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at less than the Average Closing Prices of the Common Stock, or (ii) cash, debt securities (or other evidence of Indebtedness) or other assets (excluding dividends or distributions described in Sections 10.06(a), 10.06(b) and 10.06(c) of the Indenture), which distribution pursuant to clause (ii), together with all other distributions within the preceding 12 months, has a per share value exceeding 15% of the Average Closing Price of the Common Stock.
     (ii) If the Company is a party to a Change in Control or a consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other assets, at any time from or after the date which is 15 days prior to the anticipated effective time of the transaction until 35 days after the actual date of such transaction (or, if the transaction is a Change in Control, until the Change in Control Purchase Date). After the effective time of the transaction, settlement of the Conversion Value will be based on the kind and amount of cash, securities or other assets of the Company or another Person that a holder of Common Stock received in such transaction; that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Conversion Value will be paid in cash and at the Company's election, cash, securities or a combination of cash and securities in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, then from and after the effective date of such transaction, the Securities shall be convertible (during the period that the Securities are otherwise convertible) into the consideration that a majority of the holders of Common Stock who made such an election received in such
provided
 
transaction.
     The Company will notify Holders (in the manner set forth in Section 10.01 of the Indenture), the Trustee and the Conversion Agent as promptly as practicable following the date the Company publicly announces such transaction (but in no event less than 15 days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction).
     If the Company makes a distribution described in paragraph (c)(i), the Company must notify Holders (in the manner set forth in Section 10.01 of the Indenture), the Trustee and the Conversion Agent at least 20 days prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time until the earlier of the Close of Business on the Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place, even if the Securities are not otherwise convertible at that time. No adjustment to the ability of Holders to convert will be made if Holders are entitled to participate in the distribution without conversion.
     Promptly after the Securities are no longer convertible in accordance with this clause (c), the Company shall give the Trustee and the Conversion Agent written notice thereof.
     In the case of a Change in Control, (i) the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as described in Section 10.11 of the Indenture and (ii) the Holder can require the Company to purchase all or a portion of its Securities described in paragraph 5.
     A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Change in Control Purchase Notice exercising the option of such Holder to require the Company to purchase such Security may be converted only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.
     The Initial Conversion Rate is 22.8343 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 Principal Amount, subject to adjustment in certain events described in the Indenture. The Company will deliver cash or a check in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Holders may surrender the Securities for conversion at any time on or after January 15, 2014, until the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Stated Maturity Date.
     Accrued and unpaid interest will not be paid in cash on Securities that are converted but will be paid in the manner provided in the following paragraph; , that Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the Close of Business on any Regular Record Date next preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date, shall be entitled to receive such semiannual interest payable on such Securities on the corresponding Interest Payment Date and Securities surrendered for conversion during such periods must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest with respect thereto that the registered Holder is to receive; that no such payment need be made (i) in connection with any conversion following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the final Interest Payment Date; (ii) if the Company has specified a Change in Control
provided, however
provided
 
Purchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (iii) to the extent of Defaulted Interest, if any Defaulted Interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Security.
     A Holder may convert a portion of a Security if the Principal Amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. No payment or adjustment will be made for dividends on the Common Stock except as provided in the Indenture. On conversion of a Security, a Holder will not receive, except as described herein, any cash payment representing accrued interest. Instead, accrued interest will be deemed paid by the cash and/or shares of Common Stock received by the Holder on conversion. Delivery to the Holder of such cash and/or shares will be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation to pay (i) the Principal Amount of the Security and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, and accrued interest with respect to the converted Security shall not be cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid in full.
     The Company will not adjust the Conversion Rate to account for accrued interest.
     To convert a Security that is represented by a Global Security, a Holder must convert by book-entry transfer to the Conversion Agent through the facilities of the DTC. To convert a Security that is represented by a Certificated Security, a Holder must (1) complete and manually sign the conversion notice below and deliver such notice to the Conversion Agent, (2) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (3) furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Conversion Agent, the Company or the Trustee and (4) pay all transfer or similar tax, if required.
     To the extent provided in the Indenture, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted for dividends or distributions on Common Stock payable in Common Stock or other Capital Stock; subdivisions, combinations or certain reclassifications of Common Stock; distributions to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights to purchase Common Stock for a period expiring within 60 days of the record date for such distribution at less than the Average Closing Price of the Common Stock; distributions to such holders of assets (including shares of Capital Stock of a Subsidiary) or debt securities of the Company or certain rights to purchase securities of the Company; cash dividends or cash distributions; and distributions in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer of the Common Stock. However, no adjustment need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction or in certain other cases.
7. Defaulted Interest.
     Any Defaulted Interest on any Security shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date, by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company as provided for in Section 11.02 of the Indenture.
8. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.
     The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 of Principal Amount and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder may transfer or exchange
 
Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of any Securities in respect of which a Change in Control Purchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a Security to be purchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be purchased).
9. Persons Deemed Owners.
     Subject to Section 11.01 of the Indenture, the registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of this Security for all purposes.
10. Unclaimed Money or Securities.
     The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company upon written request any money or securities held by them for the payment of any amount with respect to the Securities that remains unclaimed for two years, subject to applicable unclaimed property laws. After return to the Company, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall have no further responsibility with respect to such money or securities and the Holders entitled to the money or securities must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.
11. Amendment; Waiver.
     Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding and (ii) certain Defaults may be waived with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company pursuant to Article V of the Indenture, to comply with Section 10.16 of the Indenture, to add guarantees with respect to the Securities, to secure the Company's obligations under this Security or to add to the Company's covenants or Events of Default for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred, or to comply with any requirement of the TIA or the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or as necessary in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act, to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture by a successor Trustee, to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holders in any material respect or to eliminate the Company's option to elect to pay cash to Holders of Securities surrendered for conversion in lieu of all or a portion of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities pursuant to Section 10.02 of the Indenture.
12. Defaults and Remedies.
     Under the Indenture, Events of Default include: (1) the Company defaults in payment of
 
any interest due on the Securities, which default continues for 30 days; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the Principal Amount or Change in Control Purchase Price, when the same becomes due and payable; (3) the Company fails to comply with any of its covenants or warranties in the Indenture (other than those referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above) and such failure continues for 90 days after the giving to the Company of a Notice of Default; (4) the Company defaults in respect of any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any consolidated Subsidiary, or under any Mortgage, indenture or instrument under which such Indebtedness is issued or secured, which default results in the acceleration of Indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of $50,000,000, unless the acceleration is rescinded, or such debt is paid or waived within 10 days after the giving to the Company of a Notice of Default; and (5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, may declare the Principal Amount through the date of such declaration, and any accrued and unpaid interest through the date of such declaration, on all the Securities to be due and payable immediately. Certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency are Events of Default which will result in the Principal Amount on the Securities, and any accrued and unpaid interest through the occurrence of such event, becoming due and payable immediately upon the occurrence of such Events of Default.
     Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may refuse to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it receives indemnity or security satisfactory to it. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities at the time outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default (except a Default in payment of amounts specified in clause (1) or (2) above) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interests.
13. Trustee Dealings with the Company.
     Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
14. No Recourse Against Others.
     A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
15. Authentication.
     This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually
 
signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the other side of this Security.
16. Abbreviations.
     Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
17. Governing Law.

Shelf Registration
     (a) The Company shall, at its cost, file with the SEC, and use its reasonable efforts to cause to become effective, a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders that have provided the information pursuant to Section 2.1(c) no later than 220 days after the Closing Time.
     (b) The Company shall, at its cost, use its reasonable efforts, subject to Section 2.5, to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders for a period of two years from the first Closing Time, or until the Securities cease to be Registrable Securities (the "Effectiveness Period").
     (c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no Holder of Registrable Securities may include any of its Registrable Securities in the Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless the Holder furnishes to the Company a fully completed notice and questionnaire in the form attached as Annex A to the Final Memorandum (the "Questionnaire") and such other information in writing as the Company may reasonably request in writing for use in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus included therein and in any application to be filed with or under state securities laws. At least 30 days prior to the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company will provide notice to the Holders of its intention to file the Shelf Registration Statement; , that if the Company elects to register the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement that has already been declared effective, the Company will provide notice to the Holders of its intention to file the initial Prospectus at least 30 days prior to such filing. In order to be named as a selling

securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus at the time of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or such Prospectus, as applicable, each Holder must no later than 20 days following notice by the Company of such filing, furnish the completed Questionnaire and such other information that the Company may reasonably request in writing, if any, to the Company in writing and the Company will include the information from the completed Questionnaire and such other information, if any, in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as necessary and in a manner, so that upon effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement the Holder will be permitted to deliver the Prospectus to purchasers of the Holder's Registrable Securities. From and after the date that the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective, upon receipt of a completed Questionnaire and such other information that the Company may reasonably request in writing, if any, the Company will use its reasonable efforts to file any amendments or supplements to the Shelf Registration Statement necessary for such Holder to be named as a selling securityholder in the Prospectus contained therein to permit such Holder to deliver the Prospectus to purchasers of the Holder's Securities (subject to the Company's right to suspend the Shelf Registration Statement as described in Section 2.5 below); , , that the Company shall not be required to file any such amendment or supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement until such time as the Company has received completed Questionnaires with respect to at least $100 million aggregate principal amount of Registrable Securities and in no event more than once in any calendar quarter. Holders that do not deliver a completed written Questionnaire and such other information, as provided for in this Section 2.1(c), will not be named as selling securityholders in the Prospectus. Each Holder named as a selling securityholder in the Prospectus agrees to promptly furnish to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make information previously furnished to the Company by the Holder not materially misleading and any other information regarding such Holder and the distribution of such Holder's Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

     (d) Each Holder agrees that if such Holder wishes to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus it will do so only in accordance with Section 2.1(c) and Section 2.5. Each Holder agrees not to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement without delivering, or causing to be delivered, a Prospectus to the purchaser thereof and, following termination of the Effectiveness Period, to notify the Company, within ten days of a written request by the Company, of the amount of Registrable Securities sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and, in the absence of a response, the Company may assume that all of such Holder's Registrable Securities have been so sold.
     (e) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of a majority of the Registrable Securities that are registered under the Shelf Registration Statement at such time or the consent of the managing Underwriter in connection with any underwritten offering of Registrable Securities, and each Holder represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Company and any such Underwriter, it will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a Free Writing Prospectus, required to be filed with the SEC. The Company represents that any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus; and that any Issuer
 
Free Writing Prospectus, when taken together with the information in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus, will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     The Company agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company, or to the extent the Company does not reasonably object, as reasonably requested by the Initial Purchasers with respect to information relating to such Initial Purchaser or by a Holder with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC.
     2.2 . The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2.1. Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.

     2.3 . After a Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or any other governmental agency or court, such Shelf Registration Statement will be deemed not to have been effective during the period of such interference, until the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement may legally resume.

     2.4 . In the event that (a) a Shelf Registration Statement has not been filed with the SEC and become effective on or before the 220 calendar day following the first Closing Time, (b) after effectiveness, subject to Section 2.5, the Shelf Registration Statement fails to be effective or usable by the Holders without being succeeded within ten business days by a post-effective amendment or a report filed with the SEC pursuant to the 1934 Act that cures the failure to be effective or usable, or (c) the Shelf Registration Statement is unusable by the Holders for any reason, and the number of days for which the Shelf Registration Statement shall not be usable exceeds the Suspension Period (as defined in Section 2.5) (each such event being a "Registration Default"), additional interest, as liquidated damages ("Liquidated Damages"), will accrue at a rate per annum of 0.125% of the principal amount of the Registrable Securities then remaining for the first 90-day period from and including the day following the Registration Default, and thereafter at a rate per annum of 0.25% of the principal amount of the Registrable Securities; that in no event shall Liquidated Damages accrue at a rate per annum exceeding 0.25% of the principal amount of the Registrable Securities; and that no Liquidated Damages shall accrue after the second anniversary of the first Closing Time; and that Liquidated Damages shall not accrue under clause (b) or (c) above with respect to any Holder that (x) does not submit a properly completed Questionnaire and (y) is not named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement. Upon the cure of all Registration Defaults then continuing, the accrual of Liquidated Damages will automatically cease and the interest rate borne by the Registrable Securities will revert to the original interest rate at such time. Liquidated Damages shall be computed based on the actual number of days

Holders who have converted Registrable Securities into Common Stock will not be entitled to receive any Liquidated Damages with respect to such Common Stock or the issue price of the Registrable Securities converted.
     The parties agree that the sole monetary damages payable for a violation of the terms of this Agreement with respect to which Liquidated Damages are expressly provided shall be such Liquidated Damages. Nothing shall preclude a Holder of Registrable Securities from pursuing or obtaining specific performance or equitable relief with regard to this Agreement. Each obligation to pay Liquidated Damages shall be deemed to accrue from and including the day following the Registration Default to but excluding the day on which the Registration Default is cured.
     A Registration Default under clause (a) above shall be cured on the date that the Shelf Registration Statement is filed and has become effective. A Registration Default under clause (b) above shall be cured on the date an amended Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective or the Company otherwise declares the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus useable. The Company will have no liabilities for monetary damages other than the Liquidated Damages with respect to any Registration Default.
     The parties agree that the Liquidated Damages provided for in this Section 2.4 constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred by Holders of Registrable Securities and do not constitute a penalty.
     2.5 . The Company may suspend the use of any Prospectus, without incurring or accruing any obligation to pay Liquidated Damages pursuant to Section 2.4, for a period not to exceed 90 consecutive calendar days or an aggregate of 180 calendar days in any twelve-month period (each, a "Suspension Period") if the Company shall have determined in good faith that because of valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including without limitation proposed or pending corporate developments and similar events or because of filings with the SEC, it is in the best interests of the Company to suspend such use, and prior to suspending such use the Company provides the Holders with notice of such suspension, which notice need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to such suspension. Each Holder shall keep confidential any communications received by it from the Company regarding the suspension of the use of the Prospectus, except as required by applicable law.

     (b) Each Holder who has provided information to the Company in accordance with Section 2.1(c), severally, but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Initial Purchaser, each Underwriter and the other selling Holders who have provided information to the Company in accordance with Section 2.1(c), and each of their respective directors and officers, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Initial Purchaser, any Underwriter or any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 4(a), as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus included therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information with respect to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder expressly for use in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto);
     (c) The Initial Purchasers and the Underwriters, if any, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Holders of Registrable Securities and each Person, if any, who controls the Company or any Holder of Registrable Securities within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Initial Purchasers or the Underwriters, if any, as applicable, expressly for use in the Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (d) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for
provided
however
 
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 4 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (e) If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 4(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 45 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, that an indemnifying party shall not be liable for any such settlement effected without its consent if such indemnifying party (1) reimburses such indemnified party in accordance with such request to the extent it considers such request to be reasonable and (2) provides notice to the indemnified party describing any unpaid balance it believes is unreasonable and the reasons therefor, in each case prior to the date of such settlement.
provided
     (f) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 4 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, or by the Holders or the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company, the Holders and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
 
referred to above in this Section 4. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 4 shall be deemed to include any reasonable out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4, no Initial Purchaser or Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by such Initial Purchaser or Holder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser or Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 4, each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser or Holder, and each director of the Company, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

     The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Initial Purchasers, bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities.
 
     The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased and sold by it hereunder exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each Initial Purchaser's Affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Initial Purchasers' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section are several in proportion to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
     SECTION 9. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or its Affiliates or selling agents, any person controlling any Initial Purchaser, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Securities.

     (a) if the number of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, each of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or
     (b) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased hereunder, this
 
Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Initial Purchaser" includes any person substituted for an Initial Purchaser under this Section.

     5. If a change in control occurs and a holder elects to convert in connection with such event, the conversion rate will be increased by a number of shares. The number of additional shares will be determined by reference to the following table and is based on the date on which such change in control becomes effective and the price paid per share of common stock on the effective date:
     If the price paid per share on the effective date exceeds $150.00 per share, subject to adjustment, no adjustment to the applicable conversion rate will be made.
     If the price paid per share on the effective date is less than $35.75 per share, subject to adjustment, no adjustment to the applicable conversion rate will be made.
