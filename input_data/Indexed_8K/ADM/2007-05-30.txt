News Release
ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND COMPANY ANNOUNCES TENDER OFFER FOR UP TO $400 MILLION OF ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT
Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced the commencement of cash tender offers for up to $400 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debentures listed below (the "Debentures"). The terms and conditions of the tender offers are described in the Offer to Purchase, dated May 30, 2007, and related Letter of Transmittal. Copies of these documents are available to holders from Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary and information agent for the tender offers.
 
     The tender offer for each series of Debentures will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on June 26, 2007 unless extended.
     Holders must tender their Debentures by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 7, 2007, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration (which includes the applicable early tender payment set out above). Holders who tender
 
their Debentures after such date and prior to the expiration date will be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration less the early tender payment.
     The applicable total consideration will be determined as described in the Offer to Purchase based on the present value of future payments on the applicable Debentures discounted to the settlement date at a rate equal to the sum of the yield to maturity for the applicable reference security, calculated by the lead dealer managers based on the bid -side price at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 22, 2007, plus the applicable fixed spread, minus accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.
     In addition, payments for Debentures purchased will include accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement date.
     The amount of each series of Debentures that will be purchased will be determined in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Level set forth above and may be prorated as described in the Offer to Purchase. All Debentures with the Acceptance Priority Level 1 will be accepted before any Debentures with the Acceptance Priority Level 2 and so forth through succeeding levels. If the aggregate principal amount of Debentures tendered in any series exceeds the remaining amount available for such series, such Debentures will be accepted on a pro rata basis. In that event, Debentures with an Acceptance Priority Level following the prorated series of Debentures will not be accepted for payment.
     Withdrawal rights for all tender offers will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 7, 2007, unless extended or otherwise required by law.
     The settlement date is expected to be one business day following the expiration of the tender offers.
     The consummation of the tender offers is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
     ADM has retained Barclays Capital Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and Goldman, Sachs & Co. as lead dealer managers, and Global Bondholder Services Corporation as the depositary and information agent for the tender offers.
