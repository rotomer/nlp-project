News Release
     Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced the results of its previously announced cash tender offers for up to $400 million principal amount of its outstanding debentures (the "Debentures") which expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on June 26, 2007.
     The table below identifies the principal amount of each series of Debentures validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the tender offers based on information provided by Global Bondholder Services Corporation, the depositary and information agent. The table also identifies the principal amount of each series of Debentures that ADM has accepted for purchase under the terms of the Offer to Purchase dated May 30, 2007.
     Because the aggregate principal amount of Debentures tendered exceeds the $400 million tender cap, Debentures will be purchased in accordance with the applicable acceptance priority level and prorated as provided in the Offer to Purchase. Accordingly, ADM will purchase all tendered 8.875% Debentures due April 2011 and 8.125% Debentures due June 2012, and approximately 6.30% of the 7.125% Debentures due March 2013.
