     (e) Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Program. By resolution effective as of July 1, 2007, upon the recommendation of the Compensation/Succession Committee (the "Committee"), the Board of Directors of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") adopted a new annual cash incentive compensation program that replaces the portion of the long-term incentive compensation program described in the Company's proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of stockholders that was based on achievement of annual individual performance objectives. Under this new program, the executive officers and certain other officers and employees of the Company have the opportunity to receive annual cash incentive payments based upon the following criteria:
     The amount of these cash incentive payments will be based on the participant's base salary and is allocated 60% to annual RONA performance, 20% to the workplace safety objectives and 20% to the personnel development objectives. Executive officers, except for the Chief Executive Officer, participating in the program will have the opportunity to receive annual cash incentive payments ranging from 0% to 100% of their respective base salaries in fiscal year 2008; the Chief Executive Officer will have the opportunity to to receive annual cash incentive payments ranging from 0% to 260% of her respective base salary in fiscal year 2008.
     The Committee shall have the authority to adjust these payments up or down for any given year. The primary purpose of this adjustment mechanism is to minimize the possibility that participants would be rewarded or penalized for fluctuations in RONA attributable to external factors that are beyond the influence or control of the participants.
     The Company performance portion of the long-term compensation program described in the Company's proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of stockholders shall remain in effect with three (3) modifications:
