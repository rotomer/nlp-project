Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2007 were $ 2.162 billion, or $ 3.30 per share, compared to $1.312 billion, or $ 2.00 per share, last year. Net earnings for the quarter ended  June 30, 2007 were $ 955 million, or $ 1.47 per share, compared to $ 410 million, or $ .62 per share, last year.
 
Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2007 include gains on asset sales of $ 1.043 billion ($ 665 million after tax), asset impairment charges of $ 21 million ($ 13 million after tax), LIFO charges of $ 207 million ($129 million after tax) and a charge on debt repurchase of $ 46 million ($ 29 million after tax). Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2006 include gains on asset sales of $ 62 million ($ 39 million after tax), asset impairment and retirement obligation charges of $ 101 million ($ 81 million after tax), LIFO income of $ 12 million ($ 8 million after tax), Brazilian transactional tax credits of $ 46 million ($ 30 million after tax) and a $ 36 million tax credit related to adjustment of state and federal income taxes.
Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 include gains on asset sales of $ 967 million ($ 616 million after tax), asset impairment charges of $ 19 million ($ 12 million after tax), LIFO inventory charges of $ 60 million ($38 million after tax) and a charge on debt repurchase of $ 46 million ($ 29 million after tax). Net earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 include gains on asset sales of $ 28 million ($18 million after tax), asset impairment and retirement obligation charges of $ 59 million ($ 37 million after tax), LIFO charges of $ 1 million ($ 1 million after tax), and Brazilian transactional tax credits of $ 27 million ($ 17 million after tax).
Segment operating profit increased $ 515 million to $ 1.2 billion for the quarter and increased $ 1.1 billion to a record $ 3.2 billion for the year.
Oilseeds Processing operating profit of $ 587 million for the quarter and $ 1.1 billion for the year included a $440 million gain upon the exchange of the Companys interests in certain Chinese joint ventures for shares in Wilmar International, Ltd., the largest agriculture processing business in Asia. Excluding this gain, Oilseeds Processing operating profit for the quarter decreased $ 48 million to $ 147 million, from last years record quarter of $ 195 million. The decline was due principally to a decline in European rapeseed and biodiesel margins and the inclusion in 2006 results of $ 27 million in Brazilian transactional tax credits. Excluding the gain, Oilseeds Processing operating profits for the year increased $ 79 million to a record $ 677 million. The increase was primarily due to improved worldwide soybean crush margins, partially offset by lower softseed and biodiesel processing margins in Europe.
Corn Processing operating results declined $ 45 million to $ 241 million for the quarter from $ 286 million last year. The decline was due principally to higher net corn costs and lower ethanol sales volumes. For the year, operating results increased $ 242 million to a record $ 1.1 billion from $ 877 million last year. The increase was due principally to the higher average selling prices of sweetener and ethanol products partially offset by higher net corn costs.
Agricultural Services operating results of $ 241 million for the quarter included a gain of $ 153 million resulting from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United. Excluding this gain, Agricultural Services results increased $ 5 million to $ 88 million for the quarter. The increase is due primarily to improved global merchandising and handling results partially offset by lower transportation results. For the year, excluding the gain, Agricultural Services results increased $ 87 million to a record $ 362 million from $ 275 million last year. The increase reflects improved global merchandising, handling and transportation operating results.
Other segment operating results increased $ 10 million to $ 83 million for the quarter principally due to improved Financial operating results. For the year, Other segment operating profit increased $ 99 million to $ 409 million from $ 310 million last year. The increase was due principally to a gain of $ 53 million realized upon the sale of the Companys Arkady food ingredient business and to improved Financial operating results.
