ADMs record earnings for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2008 demonstrate the value created by and the strengths of our broadly diversified asset base and product portfolio, said Patricia Woertz, chairman and CEO. This quarter, heightened demand, coupled with geographic crop imbalances, drove volumes, prices and volatility in many key markets. Our teams skill in managing both risk and rapidly changing market opportunities, enabled us to deliver outstanding value for our shareholders.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 50 % to $ 16.5 billion.  Increased selling prices resulting from sharp rises in commodity prices accounted for approximately 78 % of the increase while higher sales volumes, principally feed grains, ethanol and wheat, accounted for the remaining 22 % increase.
A summary of operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings increased $ 32 million for the quarter and $ 69 million for the six months due principally to increased segment operating profit of $ 188 million for the quarter and $ 337 million for the six months partially offset by increased corporate charges related principally to LIFO inventory valuations. In addition, income taxes increased due primarily to increased pretax earnings and to a higher effective tax rate resulting from changes in the geographic mix of earnings.

Oilseeds Processing
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 27 million for the quarter and $ 66 million for the six months due principally to strong global demand for protein meal and oil. Worldwide crush volumes increased 2 % for the six months to 14.7 million metric tons. Crushing and origination results increased $ 12 million for the quarter and $ 39 million for the six months due principally to better crush margins in North America and improved origination results in South America partially offset by reduced results of European operations and increased manufacturing costs. Value added refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results for the quarter and six months include asset abandonment charges of $ 15 million and $ 18 million, respectively, compared to $ 2 million in the prior year quarter and six months. Excluding these charges, refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other operating profits increased $ 6 million for the quarter and $ 22 million for the six months principally from improved refining volumes and margins. Asia results increased $ 22 million for the quarter and $ 21 million for the six months reflecting the Companys share of improved operating earnings of Wilmar International Limited.
 
Corn Processing
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 61 million for the quarter and $ 97 million for the six months. Sweeteners and Starches operating profit decreased $ 5 million for the quarter on higher average sweetener and starch selling prices and favorable risk management results, offset by higher net corn and manufacturing costs. For the six months, Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased $ 40 million due principally to favorable risk management results. Bioproducts results declined $ 56 million for the quarter and $ 137 million for the six months due principally to higher net corn costs and lower ethanol selling prices partially offset by increased ethanol sales volumes and favorable risk management results. In addition, specialty feed results improved on increased selling prices and volumes.

Agricultural Services
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Agricultural Services results increased $ 184 million for the quarter and $ 298 million for the six months due principally to improved global merchandising and handling results as volatile commodity market conditions, large North American crops and global wheat shortages provided increased margin and volume opportunities. Transportation results declined due principally to lower barge freight rates and increased operating costs.
 
Other
Operating profits consist of earnings from:
Other operating profit increased $ 38 million for the quarter and $ 70 million for the six months. Wheat, Cocoa and Malt operations improved $ 28 million for the quarter and $ 23 million for the six months due principally to improved wheat and malt processing operating efficiencies and margins partially offset by lower cocoa press margins.  Financial earnings improved $ 10 million for the quarter and $ 47 million for the six months principally due to marketable security gains of the Companys brokerage services business, and income from private equity fund investments.
