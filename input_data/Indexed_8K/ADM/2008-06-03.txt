Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On May 27, 2008, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the "Company") made available to investors a prospectus supplement and a prospectus with respect to the issuance by ADM of 35,000,000 equity units (the "Equity Units"). The Equity Units were offered and sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated as of May 28, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among ADM and the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"). The Underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 Equity Units, solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
     Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $50 and is initially comprised of (i) a purchase contract that will obligate the holder to purchase from ADM no later than June 1, 2011, a certain number of shares of ADM's common stock, for $50 in cash; and (ii) a 1/20, or 5.0%, undivided beneficial interest in a $1,000 aggregate principal amount 4.70% debenture due 2041 (the "Debentures"). Holders of the Equity Units will be entitled to receive quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of 1.55% per year of the stated amount of $50 per unit.
     The Debentures were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Supplemental Indenture") (the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"). ADM filed the Base Indenture on September 22, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as Exhibit 4 to ADM's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-137541).
     The purchase contracts are being issued pursuant to a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2008 (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), between ADM, The Bank of New York as purchase contract agent, and The Bank of New York as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary. Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Debentures are being pledged as collateral to secure the holders' obligation to purchase the shares of common stock under the purchase contracts. The Debentures will be remarketed, subject to certain terms and conditions, prior to the purchase contract settlement date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement to be entered into by the Company and one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms.
     This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to satisfy the requirement to file (i) copies of certain agreements executed in connection with the issuance and the offering of the Equity Units, and (ii) an opinion regarding the legality of the Equity Units.
     The foregoing disclosure is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1, the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, the forms of Corporate Units and Treasury Units, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, the form of Debenture, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3, the form of Remarketing Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4, the Base Indenture previously filed with the Commission as described above, and the Supplemental Indenture, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.6.

The following exhibits are filed or furnished herewith:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 1.1
May 28, 2008
To the Representatives named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Dear Sirs:
     Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with each of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 9 hereof), for whom the representative or representatives, if any, named in Schedule I hereto are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), with respect to: (1) the issue and sale by the Company and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective number of 35,000,000 Equity Units of the Company (the "Initial Securities") set forth in Schedule II, and (2) the grant by the Company to the Underwriters of the option described in Section 2(b) hereof, all or any part of an additional 5,000,000 Equity Units (the "Option Securities"), solely to cover over-allotments. The Initial Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters, all or any part of the Option Securities and the Component Securities (as defined below) that comprise the Initial Securities and the Option Securities are hereinafter called, collectively, the "Securities." Each Security has a stated amount of $50 (the "Stated Amount") and initially consists of (1) a stock purchase contract (each, a "Stock Purchase Contract") under which the holder will agree to purchase and the Company will agree to sell on June 1, 2011 (the "Purchase Contract Settlement Date"), subject to acceleration in connection with any early settlement of such Stock Purchase Contract pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), to be dated as of the Firm Closing Date (as defined herein), among the Company, The Bank of New York, as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary, and The Bank of New York, as stock purchase contract agent (the "Stock Purchase Contract Agent"), for a price equal to the Stated Amount per Security, a number of shares of common stock (the "Issuable Common Stock") of the Company, without par value (the "Common Stock"), determined pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and (2) a 1/20, or 5.0%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in a $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 4.70% debentures due 2041 (the "Debentures").
     The Debentures are to be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of September 20, 2006, as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 3, 2008 (as amended and supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York
 
(successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representatives," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms. The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 17 hereof.
     A holder's ownership interest in the Debentures initially will be pledged to secure such holder's obligation to purchase the Issuable Common Stock on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, such pledge to be on the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     The Stock Purchase Contracts will be issued pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Stock Purchase Contracts together with the related Debentures (or, upon the occurrence of a special event redemption or a successful optional remarketing of the Debentures prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, as such Debentures are replaced by the Treasury portfolio) are herein referred to as the "Corporate Units."
     A holder of Corporate Units, at its option, may elect to create "Treasury Units" by substituting pledged U.S. treasury securities for any pledged ownership interests in the Debentures. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "Equity Units" includes both Corporate Units and Treasury Units.
     Pursuant to a remarketing agreement, the form of which is attached to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement as Exhibit P thereto (the "Remarketing Agreement") to be entered into among the Company, the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and one or more nationally-recognized investment banking firms to be selected by the Company, as reset agent(s) and remarketing agent(s), the Debentures may be remarketed, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Remarketing Agreement.
     The "Component Securities" means, collectively, the Stock Purchase Contracts, the Debentures and the Issuable Common Stock.
     The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Securities (including the Component Securities) shall be as specified in (i) the Indenture or (ii) the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (each document listed in clauses (i) through (ii), together with the Remarketing Agreement, each, a "Securities Agreement" and collectively, the "Securities Agreements").
     The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Representative(s) deem(s) advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered.
     The Company has filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-137541), as amended by post-effective amendment thereto, including the
 
related preliminary prospectus or prospectuses, which registration statement and post-effective amendment became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e). Such registration statement, as amended, covers the registration of the Securities under the Act. Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430B and Rule 424 under the Act. Such registration statement, at any given time, including the amendments thereto to such time, the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such time, the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act at such time and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof or included therein by the Regulations, is herein called the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement." The Prospectus in the form first furnished to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Securities and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b), including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act at the time of the execution of this Agreement and any preliminary prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that form a part thereof, is herein called the "Prospectus." For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing shall be deemed to mean the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system ("EDGAR").
     All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is "contained," "included" or "stated" in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or other references of like import) shall be deemed to mean and include all such financial statements and schedules and other information which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to mean and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act which is incorporated by reference in or otherwise deemed by the Regulations to be a part of or included in the Registration Statement, such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be.

Delivery and Payment.
 
(such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities specified in Schedule I being herein called the "Firm Closing Date," and, together with an Option Closing Date, each a "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.
     4. . It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Disclosure Package.
Offering by Underwriters
     5. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements.
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or any supplement or amendment to either any preliminary prospectus or to the Prospectus, whether pursuant to the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. The Company will prepare a final term sheet (the "Final Term Sheet"), in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, reflecting the final terms of the Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, and shall file such Final Term Sheet as an "issuer free writing prospectus" pursuant to Rule 433 prior to the close of business two Business Days after the date hereof; provided that the Company shall furnish the Representatives with copies of any such Final Term Sheet a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing and will not use or file any such document to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters shall object. Subject to the second preceding sentence, the Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 430B and cause the Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed in a form approved by the Representatives with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed (without reliance on Rule 424(b)(8)), and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement relating to the Securities shall become effective, (2) when the Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (3) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission, (4) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Prospectus or any document incorporated by reference therein or otherwise deemed to be a part thereof, or for any additional information, (5) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose or any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Regulations or any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of the initiation or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes or of any examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Act concerning the Registration Statement, (6) if the Company becomes the subject of a proceeding under Section 8A of the Act
 
in connection with the offering of the Securities and (7) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. The Company shall pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) (i) of the Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Regulations (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)).
     (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event, (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (3) supply any supplemented Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
     (c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
     (d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the relevant Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172),
 
as many copies of any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments thereof and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering (other than any agreement among Underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities); (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(e) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky laws and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating agencies for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent, and the fees and disbursements of their respective counsel, in connection with this Agreement, the Securities Agreements and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, Section 7 and Section 8 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees and disbursements of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     (e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such states as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Securities for purchase by institutional investors; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (f) The Company will file a listing application and all required supporting documents with respect to the Corporate Units and the Issuable Common Stock with the New York Stock Exchange and take further actions as are necessary to arrange for the listing of the Corporate Units and the Issuable Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as is practicable.
     (g) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any entity affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any entity affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase
 
a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company that are substantially similar to the Debentures (other than the Debentures and any debt securities that mature within one year of their date of issue) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day after the Firm Closing Date.
     (h) During a period of 60 days from the date hereof, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, (i) directly or indirectly, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer, lend or dispose of any share of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or repayable with Common Stock or file any registration statement under the Act with respect to any of the foregoing or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (A) the Securities to be sold hereunder, (B) any shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with a business acquisition, (C) any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon the exercise of an option or warrant or the conversion of a security outstanding on the date hereof and referred to in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or granted in accordance with clause (D) of this Section 5(h), and (D) any shares of Common Stock issued or options to purchase Common Stock granted pursuant to existing employee benefit plans of the Company.
     (i) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
     (j) The Company will (i) use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities in the manner specified in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under "Use of Proceeds" and (ii) not use more than 10 percent of the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Company's existing credit facilities with the Underwriters.
     (k) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, required to be filed with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433; provided, however, that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of any free writing prospectus included in Schedule III hereto and any electronic road show. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing
 
Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping.
     (l) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, a sufficient number of shares of Issuable Common Stock for the purpose of enabling the Company to satisfy any obligations to issue shares of its Issuable Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Contracts.
     (m) On or prior to the date that is 30 days prior to the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period (as defined in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), the Company shall have entered into, and shall have caused the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into, the Remarketing Agreement.
     6. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof, as of the date of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed prior to the relevant Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated therein by reference), as of the Applicable Time and as of the relevant Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or
 
additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel, approved by the Representatives in the case of subparagraph (a), representing the indemnified parties under subparagraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii).
     (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this Section 8 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company on grounds of policy or otherwise, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the sum of such discount and the purchase price of the Securities specified in Schedule I hereto and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that (y) in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among Underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and (z) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to clause (y) of this paragraph (d). Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this paragraph (d), notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall
 
not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have otherwise than under this paragraph (d).
     9. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bear to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.

Adjustment of each Fixed Settlement Rate

In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, each such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination.
Stock Dividends
          (ii) . In case the Company shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock rights, options, warrants or other securities, entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock for a period expiring within 45 days from the date of issuance of such rights, options, warrants or other securities at a price per share of Common Stock less than the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such rights, options, warrants or securities (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the
Stock Purchase Rights
 
opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration expected to be received by the Company upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of such rights, options, warrants or securities (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) would purchase at such Current Market Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, either directly or indirectly, each such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination.
          (iii) . In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided, split or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification becomes effective.

          (iv) . (1) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, assets or securities (but excluding any rights, options, warrants or other securities referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5.05, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash referred to in paragraph (a)(v) of this Section 5.05, any dividend, shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in the next subparagraph, and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 5.05), each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price, such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (a)(iv)(1) is applicable, paragraph (a)(iv)(2) of this Section 5.05 shall not be applicable.
Debt, Asset or Security Distributions
          (2) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders of the Company entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so
 
distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Fixed Settlement Rate under this paragraph (a)(iv)(2) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (A) the 10th Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off and (B) the date of the securities being offered in the Initial Public Offering of the Spin-Off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-Off.
          (v) . In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, make distributions to all holders of the Common Stock exclusively in cash during any quarterly period (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.05(b) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (a)(iv) of this Section 5.05) in an amount in excess of $0.13 per share of Common Stock (the ""), immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders of the Company entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination less the per share amount of the distribution and the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the date fixed for such determination minus the Reference Dividend.

          (vi) . In the case that a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders of the Company (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) per share of the Common Stock that exceeds the closing price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, then, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the last time (the "") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as amended through the Expiration Time), each Fixed Settlement Rate shall be increased by dividing each Fixed Settlement Rate immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of Cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the tender or exchange offer (assuming the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Current Market Price on the date of the Expiration Time and (y) the result of (I) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less (II) the number of all shares validly tendered, not withdrawn and accepted for payment on the date of the Expiration Time (such validly tendered shares, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "").

Purchased Shares
          (vii) If any adjustments are made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate in Section 5.01(a) will apply on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by
 
the Adjustment Factor. The "" means, initially, a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after the first adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Each time an adjustment is required to be made to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a), the Adjustment Factor shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to this Section 5.05(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Maximum Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by this Section 5.05(a) during the Observation Period, the 20 individual Closing Prices used to determine the Applicable Market Value shall be adjusted rather than the Applicable Market Value and the Applicable Market Value shall be determined by (A) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days prior to such adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate by the Adjustment Factor in effect prior to such adjustment, (B) multiplying the Closing Prices for Trading Days following such adjustment by the Adjustment Factor reflecting such adjustment, and (C) dividing the sum of all such adjusted Closing Prices by 20.
Adjustment Factor
          (viii) . All adjustments to the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Fixed Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; , that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and that effect shall be given to all adjustments not later than the applicable Settlement Date for a Unit.
Calculation of Adjustments
provided
provided further
          (ix) . The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section 5.05(a), as the Board of Directors considers advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of             shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons.
Increase of Settlement Rate
          (x) If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan involving the issuance of preference share purchase rights or other similar rights (the "") to all holders of the Common Stock, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of any Purchase Contract, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the related Rights for the Common Stock, unless such Rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of conversion, in which case each Settlement Rate shall be adjusted as provided in Section 5.05(a)(iv) on the date such Rights separate from the Common Stock.
Rights
          (b) . (i) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.05(b)(ii), upon a Reorganization Event, each Unit shall thereafter, in lieu of a variable number of shares of Common Stock, be settled by delivery of a variable number of Exchange Property Units. An "" represents the right to receive the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distributions thereon that have a record date that is prior to the applicable Settlement Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged

into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a ""), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Exchange Property Unit that Holders of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units would have been entitled to receive will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. The number of Exchange Property Units to be delivered upon settlement of a Purchase Contract following the effective date of a Reorganization Event shall equal the Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.05, determined as if the references to "shares of Common Stock" in Section 5.01(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) were to "Exchange Property Units."
Constituent Person
     In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, or merger or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Unit that remains Outstanding after the Reorganization Event (if any) shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.05(b). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments to the amount of any securities constituting all or a portion of an Exchange Property Unit which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such Reorganization Event, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.05. The above provisions of this Section 5.05(b) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events.
          (ii) Prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, if a Fundamental Change occurs, then following such Fundamental Change a Holder of a Unit will have the right to accelerate and settle ("") its Purchase Contract, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate (determined as if the Applicable Market Value equaled the Stock Price), plus an additional make-whole amount of shares (the ""); that no Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) unless, at the time such Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement. In the event that a Holder seeks to exercise its Fundamental Change Early Settlement right and a Registration Statement is required to be effective in connection with the exercise of such right but no such Registration Statement is then effective, the Holder's exercise of such right shall be void unless and until such a Registration Statement shall be effective and the Company shall have no further obligation with respect to any such Registration Statement if, notwithstanding using its commercially reasonable efforts, no Registration Statement is then effective.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement
Make-Whole Share Amount
provided
     If a Holder elects a Fundamental Change Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments, with respect to such Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by such Holder to effect such Fundamental Change Early Settlement.
 
     Within five Business Days of the Effective Date (as hereinafter defined) of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such completion of a Fundamental Change, which shall specify (1) the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) and how and where such notice to settle early should be delivered, (2) the date on which such Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be at least ten days after the date of the notice but not later than the earlier of 20 days after the date of such notice or two Business Days prior to the first day of the Final Remarketing Period) (the ""), (3) the amount of cash payable in respect of the exercise of such Fundamental Change Early Settlement (giving effect to the credit for any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the preceding paragraph), (4) the applicable Settlement Rate, (5) the Make-Whole Share Amount and (6) the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder, including any amount of Contract Adjustment Payments receivable, upon settlement.
Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date
     Corporate Units Holders (unless Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units) and Treasury Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii) in multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units; provided that the Company shall attempt to allow Holders of fewer than 80,000 Corporate Units to exercise the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement by aggregating the total number of Corporate Units in respect of which the Holders have elected to exercise such right. Any such aggregation will be made on a Pro Rata basis to the extent that any such aggregation does not allow each Holder to exercise such right in full. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.01 shall apply with respect to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(b)(ii).
     In order to exercise the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, no later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the excess of:
          (A) product of (1) the Stated Amount times (2) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement,
over
          (B) the amount of any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments (excluding, if the Fundamental Change Early Settlement occurs after the Record Date for such Contract Adjustment Payments, the amount of such payments to be made on the Payment Date immediately succeeding such Record Date).
In the event that Units are held by or through DTC or another Depositary, the exercise of the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur in conformity with the procedures established by DTC or such Depositary.
 
     Upon receipt of any such Certificate and payment of such funds, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay the Company from such funds the related Purchase Price pursuant to the terms of the related Purchase Contracts, and notify the Collateral Agent that all the conditions necessary for a Fundamental Change Early Settlement by a Holder of Units have been satisfied pursuant to which the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Purchase Price.
     Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of the notice from the Purchase Contract Agent set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (2) the Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount times (y) the number of Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Debentures underlying Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
     If a Holder properly effects an effective Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.05(b)(ii), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date:
          (A) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Fundamental Change by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Fundamental Change (based on the Settlement Rate in effect at such time plus the Make-Whole Share Amount), assuming such Holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Fundamental Change provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates. In the event holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the Fundamental Change, the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable by Holders of the Corporate Units or Treasury Units exercising their right to effect a Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Fundamental Change shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date;
          (B) the Debentures, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Fundamental Change Early Settlement;
          (C) any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments (to the extent such payments are not offset to settle the Purchase Contracts); and
 
          (D) if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.05(b)(ii).
The Corporate Units or the Treasury Units of the Holders who do not elect Fundamental Change Early Settlement in accordance with the foregoing will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof.
          (iii) The Make-Whole Share Amounts applicable to a Fundamental Change Early Settlement will be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change becomes effective (the "") and the price (the "") paid per share for Common Stock in such Fundamental Change. If holders of Common Stock receive only cash in such transaction, the Stock Price paid per share will be the cash amount paid per share. Otherwise, the Stock Price paid per share will be the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock on the five Trading Days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change.
Effective Date
Stock Price
     The Stock Prices set forth in the second row of the table (., the column headers) will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events requiring adjustments to each Fixed Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.05(a).
i.e
     Each of the Make-Whole Share Amounts set forth in the table will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Fixed Settlement Rates as set forth in Section 5.05(a).
     If the Stock Price or Effective Date applicable to a Fundamental Change is not expressly set forth on the table, then the Make-Whole Share Amount will be determined as follows:
          (1) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts on the table or the Effective Date is between two dates on the table, the Make-Whole Share Amount will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the Make-Whole Share Amounts set forth for the higher and lower Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
          (2) if the Stock Price is in excess of $150.00 per share (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 5.05(a)), then the Make-Whole Share Amount shall be zero; and
          (3) if the Stock Price is less than $10.00 per share (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 5.05(a)) (the ""), then the Make-Whole Share Amount shall be determined as if the Stock Price equaled the Minimum Stock Price, using straight-line interpolation, as described in clause (1) above, if the Effective Date is between two dates on the table.
Minimum Stock Price
 
          (c) No adjustment to the Settlement Rate need be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment, so long as the distributed assets or securities the Holders would receive upon settlement of Units, if convertible, exchangeable, or exercisable, are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as applicable, without any loss of rights or privileges for a period of at least 45 days following settlement of the Units.
          (d) The Fixed Settlement Rate shall not be adjusted:
          (1) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
          (2) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;
          (3) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Units were first issued;
          (4) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock; or
          (5) for accumulated and unpaid dividends, other than to the extent contemplated by Section 5.05(a) hereof.
          (e) All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have no responsibility with respect to this Agreement.
     Section 5.06 . (a) Whenever the Fixed Settlement Rates are adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.05 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware):
Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events
          (i) compute each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.05 and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and
          (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to each Fixed Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth each adjusted Fixed Settlement Rate.
          (b) The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of each Fixed Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent
 
shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.06(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract; and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article 5.

     Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, the Treasury Securities or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forming part of such Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.15 hereof. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register.

     Holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.08 in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.08 in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units.

The Company shall provide the Purchase Contract Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Purchase Contract Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.09 in a timely manner.

          (g) For purposes of Section 5.11(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Section 5.11(e) through (q) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment;

          (i) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders of the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Senior Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts underlying the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of such Senior
 
Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by virtue of Section 5.11(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.

In the event that the Purchase Contract Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchase Contract Agent as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Section 5.11(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Purchase Contract Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

          (o) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent in respect of the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Purchase Contract Agent, unless and until the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof mailed or delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent at its Corporate Trust Office from the Company, any Holder, or the holder or representative of any Senior Indebtedness; that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Purchase Contract Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date.

     Section 15.10 . (a) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary as provided below:
Resignation of Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary
          (i) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders;
          (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company; and
          (iii) if the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Purchase Contract Agent, acting at the direction of the Holders.
     The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company upon the transmission of notice as contemplated by clause (iii) of Section 15.10(a) and any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial
 
Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 15.10(a). Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, which shall not be an Affiliate of the Purchase Contract Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 45 days after the retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's giving of notice of resignation or the Company's or the Purchase Contract Agent's giving notice of such removal, then the retiring or removed Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction, at the expense of the Company, for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary.

The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Article 15 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such Person is also acting as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be.
          (b) Because The Bank of New York is serving as the Collateral Agent hereunder and also as the Purchase Contract Agent hereunder, if an event of default or a collateral event of default occurs hereunder The Bank of New York will resign as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary, but continue to act as the Purchase Contract Agent.

Right to Appoint Agent or Advisor

Survival
     Section 15.13 . Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities
Exculpation
 
Intermediary or their officers, directors, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them and regardless of the form of action.
     Section 15.14 . The Company agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary for:
Expenses, Etc
          (a) all reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary), in connection with (i) the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery or performance of this Agreement and (ii) any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the terms of this Agreement;

          (d) all reasonable fees and expenses of any agent or advisor appointed by the Collateral Agent and consented to by the Company under Section 15.11 of this Agreement; and
          (e) any other out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary in connection with the performance of their duties hereunder.
     Section 15.15 . In no event shall any of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or caused directly or indirectly, by acts of God; earthquake; fires; floods; wars; civil or military disturbances; terrorist acts; sabotage; epidemics; riots; interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities; accidents; labor disputes; or acts of civil or military authority or governmental actions; it being understood that the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under such circumstances.
Force Majeure
     Section 16.01 . All rights of the Collateral Agent and security interests hereunder, and all obligations of the Holders from time to time hereunder pursuant to the Pledge, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:
Security Interest Absolute
          (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any provision of the Purchase Contracts or the Units or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
          (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or any other term of, or any increase in the amount of, all or any of the obligations of Holders of the Units under the related Purchase Contracts, or any other amendment or waiver of any term of, or any consent to any departure from any requirement of, the Purchase Contract Agreement or any Purchase Contract or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto; or
          (c) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, a borrower, a guarantor or a pledgor.
     Section 16.02 . Upon the occurrence of a Special Event, a Special Event Redemption or a Termination Event, the Company shall deliver written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary.

     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2008 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the ""), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Collateral Agent, as Custodial Agent, as Securities Intermediary, as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact for the holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units from time to time, to which Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Corporate Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered.
Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement
     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate, unless an Early Settlement, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Purchase Contract is a part shall have occurred. The Settlement Rate is subject to adjustment as described in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.09 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby that is settled through Early Settlement or Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Corporate Units to purchase at the Purchase Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate plus the Make-Whole Share Amount (in the case of a Fundamental Change Early Settlement).
     In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, unless a Termination Event shall have occurred, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or a Final Remarketing of the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures. A Holder of Corporate Units who (1) does not, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Final Remarketing Period make an effective Cash Settlement in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement or (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Final Remarketing Period (in the case of Corporate Units, unless a Special Event Redemption or Successful Optional Remarketing has occurred) or the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (in the case of Corporate Units after the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption or Successful Optional Remarketing), does not make an effective Early Settlement, shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the sale of the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures held by the Collateral Agent in the Remarketing unless the Holder has previously made a Fundamental Change Early Settlement. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Debentures as a component of Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term).
 
     As provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, as of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, each Holder of any Pledged Applicable Interests in Debentures, unless such Holder has elected Cash Settlement and delivered cash in accordance with Section 5.03(a) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to the Debentures underlying such Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and to have elected to have the Proceeds of the Put Right set-off against such Holder's obligation to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under such Purchase Contracts.
     The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) forming a part of each Corporate Unit from the Pledge. A Corporate Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Debenture underlying the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of such Corporate Units in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Debentures are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Debentures, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Corporate Units Holders the notice required by the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price of such Debentures and shall deposit the funds in the Collateral Account in exchange for such Debentures. Thereafter, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio.
     Following the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Collateral Agent had in respect of Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and the underlying Debentures, as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures shall be deemed to be a
 
reference to the Treasury Portfolio or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be.
     Upon the occurrence of a Successful Optional Remarketing and receipt in the Collateral Account of the proceeds thereof, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase, on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio.
     Following the occurrence of a Successful Optional Remarketing, the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Collateral Agent had in respect of Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and the underlying Debentures, as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures shall be deemed to be a reference to the Treasury Portfolio or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be.
     The Corporate Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Corporate Units Certificate will be registered and Corporate Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for the Debenture underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, such Corporate Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Unit in respect of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures, or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and Purchase Contract constituting such Corporate Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Corporate Unit.
     Subject to, and in compliance with, the conditions and terms set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Holder of Corporate Units may effect a Collateral Substitution. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which Pledged Treasury Securities secure the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Treasury Unit". A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units for 20 Treasury Units. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units as a result of a Special Event Redemption, a Holder may substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio only in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units. No Collateral Substitution is permitted following a Successful Optional Remarketing.
     Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units, or if Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units.
     Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement
 
and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
     Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a Holder of Corporate Units may effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Corporate Units pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Corporate Units, or if the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units, in integral multiples of 80,000 Corporate Units. Upon Fundamental Change Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Corporate Units, the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) underlying such Corporate Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Corporate Unit as to which Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.
     Upon registration of transfer of this Corporate Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Corporate Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
     The Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures and the underlying Debentures or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, underlying this Corporate Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, any payments with respect the Debentures underlying the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures (other than interest payments thereon) or the Proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term), as the case may be, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the related Purchase Contracts shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
     Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
 
     The Purchase Contracts shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such state.
     The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock.
     Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Corporate Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest payable on the Debentures underlying the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The transfer of any Treasury Units Certificate will be registered and Treasury Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. A Holder who elects to substitute Debentures or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract constituting such Treasury Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Treasury Unit.
     Subject to, and in compliance with, the conditions and terms set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Holder of Treasury Units may effect a Collateral Substitution. From and after such substitution, each Unit for which Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures, or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, secure the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Corporate Unit". A Holder may make such Collateral substitution only in multiples of 20 Treasury Units for 20 Corporate Units. If Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio have replaced the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures as a component of the Corporate Units as a result of a Special Event Redemption, a Holder may substitute Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Treasury Securities only in integral multiples of 80,000 Treasury Units. No Collateral Substitution is permitted following a Successful Optional Remarketing.
     Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts underlying Units may be settled early by effecting an Early Settlement as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units.
     Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Treasury Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to the Minimum Settlement Rate.
     Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, a Holder of Treasury Units may effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Treasury Units pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement in integral multiples of 20 Treasury Units. Upon Fundamental Change Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Treasury Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Treasury Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract forming part of a Treasury Unit as to which Fundamental Change Early Settlement is effected equal to the applicable Settlement Rate.
     Upon registration of transfer of this Treasury Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Treasury Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
 
     The Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Treasury Securities underlying this Treasury Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the related Purchase Contracts shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contracts and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments.
     Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.
     The Purchase Contracts shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such state.
     The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock.
     Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Treasury Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Remarketing Agent's agreement to indemnify the Company and any other indemnified person as aforesaid is expressly conditioned upon the Remarketing Agent being notified of the action in connection therewith brought against the Company or any other indemnified person by letter, telegram, or facsimile transmission addressed to it at its address furnished to the Company for the purpose, with reasonable
 
promptness after the first legal process which discloses the nature of the liability or claim shall have been served upon the Company or any other indemnified person (or after the Company or any such person shall have received notice of such service on any agent designated by the Company or any such person), but failure so to notify the Remarketing Agent shall not relieve the Remarketing Agent from any liability which it may have to the Company or any other indemnified person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.

The Remarketing Agent shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Remarketing Agent from all liability arising out of such loss, expense, liability or claim.
     (a) If the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 7(a) and 7(b) above for any reason other than as specified therein in respect of any losses, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand from the remarketing of the Remarketed Debentures; or (ii) if the allocation provided in clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by
 
the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds (before deducting expenses) to the Company from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Debentures bears to the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Remarketing Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Remarketing Agent and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any claim or action.
     (b) The Company and the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee exceeds the amount of any damages that the Remarketing Agent have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in Section 7 and Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 shall survive the termination and cancellation of this Agreement.

If a Special Event shall occur and be continuing prior to the earlier of the date of a Successful Remarketing and the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, on any Interest Payment Date, at a price per Debenture equal to the Redemption Price, payable on the date of redemption (the "").
Special Event Redemption
Special Event Redemption Date
     In connection with any Special Event Redemption, in exchange for any Debentures surrendered for redemption on or after the relevant Special Event Redemption Date, the Trustee shall pay the Redemption Price (a) to the Collateral Agent, in the case of Debentures that underlie the Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures
 
included in Corporate Units, which amount shall be applied by the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, and (b) to the Holders of the Separate Debentures, in the case of Separate Debentures.
     Section 3.02 . The Company may redeem the Debentures, in whole but not in part, on a date not earlier than June 1, 2013, at a price per Debenture equal to the Redemption Price, payable on the date of redemption (the "") to the Holder presenting such Debenture for redemption.
Optional Redemption
Optional Redemption Date
     The Company may at any time irrevocably waive its right to redeem the Debentures for any specified period (including the remaining term of the Debentures). The Company may not redeem the Debentures under this Section 3.02 if the Debentures have been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or unless all accrued and unpaid interest has been paid in full on all outstanding Debentures for all Interest Periods terminating on or prior to the Redemption Date.
     Section 3.03 . Solely with respect to the Debentures, Section 1104 of the Base Indenture is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following:
Notice of Redemption
     In addition, the Company shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing that the Company intends to redeem the Debentures on the Redemption Date and, in the case of a Special Event Redemption, that a Special Event has occurred. If the Company elects to redeem the Debentures in connection with a Special Event Redemption, the Company shall appoint the Quotation Agent to assist the Company in determining the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price.
     Section 3.04 . Notice of redemption having been given as provided for in Section 1104 of the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, the Debentures shall become due and payable on the Redemption Date at the Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, (a) interest shall cease to accrue on the Debentures immediately prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date and (b) the Debentures shall no longer be outstanding and all rights of the Holders in respect of the Debentures shall terminate and lapse (other than the right to receive the Redemption Price upon surrender of such Debentures but without interest on such Redemption Price). The redemption provisions of Sections 1105 and 1106 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Debentures.
Effect of Redemption
     Section 3.05 . On or prior to the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Redemption Date, the aggregate Redemption Price for Debentures being redeemed. If the Company gives a notice of redemption with respect to the Debentures pursuant to Section 3.03 in connection with an Optional Redemption, and the Company has paid to the Trustee the Redemption Price of the Debentures to be redeemed, then, on the Redemption Date, the Trustee will irrevocably deposit such funds with the Depositary. The Company will also give the Depositary irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price in immediately available funds to the Holders of beneficial interests in the Global Debentures. If any Redemption Date is not a Business Day, then the Redemption Price will be payable on the next Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). Interest to be paid on or before the Redemption Date for any Debentures called for Redemption shall be payable to the Persons in whose names the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Dates for the related Interest Payment Dates. If any Debentures called for redemption are not so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the Redemption Price will, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the Coupon Rate or Reset Rate, as the case may be. In exchange for the unredeemed portion of such surrendered Debentures, new Debentures in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued.

The Company will, not later than 15 days prior to the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period, request that the Depositary or its nominee notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Separate Debentures, Corporate Units and Treasury Units, and shall provide a copy of such request to the Collateral Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, of the Company's intent to attempt an Optional Remarketing in the Applicable Remarketing Period, and in all cases, of the proposed Remarketing Date or Dates and the procedures to be followed in each Remarketing, including the procedures to be followed by Holders of Separate Debentures to participate in a Remarketing, the applicable procedures for holders of Corporate Units to create Treasury Units or holders of Treasury Units to recreate Corporate Units, the applicable procedures for holders of Corporate Units to effect an Early Settlement and, in the case of a Final Remarketing, applicable procedures to effect a Cash Settlement and the applicable procedures that must be followed by a Holder of Separate Debentures if such Holder wishes to exercise its Put Right or by a Holder if such Holder elects not to exercise its Put Right.
          (b) Each Holder of Separate Debentures may elect to have Separate Debentures held by such Holder remarketed in any Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must, pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Separate Debentures to the Custodial Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period (but no earlier than the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding such first day). Any such notice and delivery may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing. Any such notice and delivery may be withdrawn prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. Any such notice and delivery not withdrawn by such time will be irrevocable with respect to each Remarketing to occur during the Applicable Remarketing Period. Pursuant to Sections 5.02 and 5.03 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, or promptly after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of a Final Remarketing, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period, the Custodial Agent, based on the notices and deliveries received by it prior to such time, shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Debentures tendered for Remarketing.

          (c) The right of each Holder of Remarketed Debentures to have such Debentures remarketed and sold on any Remarketing Date shall be subject to the conditions that (i)(A) the Remarketing Agent conducts any Optional Remarketing or (B) in the case of a Final Remarketing, that no Successful Optional Remarketing has occurred pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) neither a Special Event Redemption nor a Termination Event has occurred prior to such Remarketing Date, (iii) the Remarketing Agent(s) are able to find a purchaser or purchasers for Remarketed Debentures at the Remarketing Price based on the Reset Rate and (iv) the purchaser or purchasers of the Remarketed Debentures deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent as and when required.

     Section 8.02 .
Remarketing
          (a) Unless a Special Event Redemption, a Termination Event or a Successful Optional Remarketing has occurred prior to the first day of any Optional Remarketing Period, on any Remarketing Date, if any, selected by the Company in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for such Optional Remarketing Period, the Remarketing Agent shall, pursuant and subject to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Debentures at the Remarketing Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall determine in its sole discretion if and when to attempt an Optional Remarketing.
          (b) If the Company does not elect to conduct an Optional Remarketing, or if the Company elects to conduct an Optional Remarketing, but a Failed Optional Remarketing occurs, during the Final Remarketing Period, the Remarketing Agent shall use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Remarketed Debentures at the Remarketing Price. It is understood and agreed that Remarketing on any Remarketing Date will be considered successful and no further attempts will be made if the resulting proceeds are at least equal to the Remarketing Price.
     Section 8.03 .
Reset Rate
          (a) In connection with each Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth (0.001) of one percent per annum).
          (b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
          (c) In the event of a Failed Final Remarketing or if no Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures are included in Corporate Units and none of the Holders of the Separate Debentures elect to have their Debentures remarketed in any Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Debentures will not be reset and will continue to be the Coupon Rate.
          (d) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Coupon Rate shall be reset on the Remarketing Settlement Date to the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent under the Remarketing Agreement, and the Company shall issue a press release promptly after such Successful Remarketing containing such Reset Rate and publish such information on its website.
          (e) In the event of a Failed Optional Remarketing or a Failed Final Remarketing the Company shall issue a press release and cause a notice of any Failed Remarketing to be published on its website (with a copy of such notice to be provided to the Purchase Contract Agent) before 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the Business Day immediately following such Failed Optional Remarketing, or in the case of the Final Remarketing, 9:00 a.m. New York City time on May 27, 2011.

Failed Remarketing
 
condition precedent to the Remarketing has not been fulfilled, a Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred.
     Section 8.05 .
Put Right
          (a) Subject to paragraph (b) hereof, if there has not been a Successful Remarketing prior to the end of the Final Remarketing Period, Holders of Debentures will, subject to this Section 8.05, have the right (the ") to require the Company to purchase such Debentures on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, at a price per Debenture to be purchased equal to the principal amount of the applicable Debenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (the "").

Put Price
          (b) The Put Right of Holders of Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures that are part of Corporate Units will be deemed to be automatically exercised unless such Holders (1) prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, provide written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of their intention to settle the related Purchase Contract with separate cash, and (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, deliver to the Collateral Agent $50 in cash per Purchase Contract, in each case pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 5.03(b)(iii) of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement with respect to such settlement, and such Holders shall be deemed to have elected to have a portion of the proceeds of the Put Right of the Debentures underlying such Applicable Ownership Interests in Debentures equal to the Purchase Price set-off against such Holders' obligations to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts, and any remaining amount of the Put Price following satisfaction of the related Purchase Contracts will be paid to such Holders.
          (c) The Put Right of a Holder of a Separate Debenture shall only be exercisable upon delivery of a notice substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto, together with such Holder's separate Debenture, to the Trustee by such Holder on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. On or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the aggregate Put Price of all Separate Debentures with respect to which a Holder has exercised a Put Right. In exchange for any Separate Debentures surrendered pursuant to the Put Right, the Trustee shall then distribute such amount to the Holders of such Separate Debentures.
          (d) Debentures purchased pursuant to the Put Right shall be cancelled by the Trustee.
     Section 9.01 . Solely with respect to the Debentures, in addition to the events listed as Events of Default in Section 501 of the Base Indenture, a default in the payment on the date payment is due of the Put Price of any Debentures following the exercise of the Put Right by any Holder of Debentures, unless the Debentures are a component of Corporate Units, in which case the Company's obligation to pay the portion of the Put Price owing in respect of the principal of the Debentures so put will be netted against such Holder's obligations to pay the purchase price under the related Purchase Contract on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in full satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contracts, shall be an additional Event of Default with respect to the Debentures.
Additional Events of Default
     Section 10.01 . The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a Corporate Unit or a Separate Debenture, each Holder will be deemed to have agreed (1) to treat each beneficial owner of a Corporate Unit as the owner of the Applicable Ownership Interest in Debentures constituting a part of such Corporate Unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (2) to treat the Debentures as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which is not subject to the contingent payment debt regulations.

June 3, 2008
Archer-Daniels-Midland Company 4666 Faries Parkway Decatur, Illinois 62526
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 35,000,000 equity units (40,000,000 equity units if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) (the "Equity Units") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated May 28, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company and the underwriters named therein. The Equity Units will initially consist of 35,000,000 corporate units (the "Corporate Units") with a stated amount, per Corporate Unit, of $50 (the "Stated Amount"). Each Corporate Unit will initially consist of (a) a stock purchase contract (each a "Stock Purchase Contract") under which (i) the holder will agree to purchase on June 1, 2011 (the "Purchase Contract Settlement Date"), subject to acceleration in connection with any early settlement of such Stock Purchase Contract pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (as defined below), for an amount of cash equal to the Stated Amount, a number of shares (the "Issuable Common Stock") of common stock of the Company, no par value (the "Common Stock"), determined pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and (ii) the Company will pay to the holder contract adjustment payments at a rate of 1.55% per annum and (b) a 1/20, or 5%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in a $1,000 principal amount of debentures due 2041 (the "Debentures") issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York (successor to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as Trustee, as amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of June 3, 2008 (the "First Supplemental Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee. The Base Indenture, as so amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, is hereinafter referred to as the "Indenture."
     The Equity Units are to be issued pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement (the "Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement"), dated as of June 3, 2008, among the Company, The Bank of New York, as purchase contract agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"), and The Bank of New York as collateral agent, custodial agent and securities intermediary. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, a holder's ownership interest in the Debentures initially will be pledged to secure such holder's obligation to purchase the Issuable Common Stock on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, such pledge to be on the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     In that connection, we have reviewed originals or copies of the following documents:
     (a) The Underwriting Agreement.
     (b) The Indenture.
     (c) The form of Debenture.
     (d) The Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
     (e) The form of Corporate Units certificate.
 
     (f) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as amended through September 22, 2005 and February 3, 2007, respectively.
     (g) The automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-137541) filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on September 22, 2006 and a post-effective amendment no. 1 thereto ("Post-Effective Amendment No. 1") filed by the Company under the Securities Act with the Commission on May 27, 2008 (such automatic shelf registration statement, as so amended, including information deemed to be part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, and including the documents incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement").
     (h) The prospectus, dated May 27, 2008, forming a part of the Registration Statement, with respect to the offering from time to time of the Company's securities (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement, dated May 28, 2008, relating to the Equity Units (the "Final Prospectus Supplement") (the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Final Prospectus Supplement, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Prospectus").
     (i) Originals or copies of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company and agreements and other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
     In our review, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of the originals of the documents submitted to us and the conformity to authentic originals of any documents submitted to us as copies. We have further assumed, as to matters of fact, the truthfulness of the representations made in certificates of public officials and officers of the Company; that each of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Company, enforceable against each such party in accordance with its terms. We also have assumed that the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement or the Indenture will not (a) contravene the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or (c) result in any conflict with or breach of any agreement or document binding on the Company.
     Our opinions set forth below are limited to the law of the State of Minnesota and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and, with respect to the opinions expressed in paragraphs 1-3 only, the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law.
     Based upon the foregoing, and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary and subject to the qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
2. The Debentures have been duly authorized by the Company, and when the Debentures have been duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and delivered against payment for the Corporate Units of which they are a part in accordance with the terms of Underwriting Agreement and the Purchase Contract and Pledge
 
Agreement, the Debentures will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
3. The Corporate Units have been duly executed by the Company and, when authenticated in accordance with the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement and delivered to and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, assuming that the certificates evidencing the Corporate Units have been duly executed by the Purchase Contract Agent, as attorney-in-fact of the holders thereof, the Corporate Units will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
4. The shares of Issuable Common Stock have been duly authorized by the Company and reserved for issuance and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of the Issuable Common Stock will not be subject to preemptive rights pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company.
     The opinions set forth above are subject to (i) the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers) and (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     We understand that this opinion is to be used in connection with the Registration Statement. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name in the Prospectus under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
