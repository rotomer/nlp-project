ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND REPORTS ANNUAL RESULTS
 
 
 
 
 
ADMs 2008 results demonstrate the ability of our people to leverage our global assets against an exceptional set of opportunities said Patricia Woertz, Chairman and CEO.  We had an outstanding year, highlighted by record segment operating profit.  ADM met the needs of food, feed, fuel and industrial customers even as strong demand for crops and commodities challenged the global supply chain.

Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 78 % to $ 21.8 billion for the quarter and 59 % to $ 69.8 billion for the twelve months.  For both the quarter and year, higher selling prices resulting primarily from sharp rises in underlying commodity costs accounted for approximately 90 % of the increase while higher sales volumes, principally ethanol and merchandised oilseeds and grains, accounted for the remaining 10 % increase.
 
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
 
 
Net earnings decreased $ 583 million for the quarter and $ 360 million for the twelve months due principally to the impact on Earnings before income taxes of $ 967 million and $ 1.042 billion of gains related to asset disposals recognized in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2007, respectively.  In addition, Corporate results decreased due to charges related to LIFO inventory valuations which increased from $ 60 million to $ 198 million for the quarter and from $ 207 million to $ 569 million for the year.  Income taxes decreased $ 272 million for the quarter and $ 170 million for the twelve months due principally to decreased income before tax.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
 
 
Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased $ 217 million for the quarter and $ 99 million for the twelve months due principally to the $ 440 million gain in last years quarter related to the exchange of the Companys interests in certain Chinese joint ventures for shares in Wilmar International Ltd., partially offset by improved global processing margins.  Crushing and origination results increased $ 196 million for the quarter and $ 313 million for the twelve months due to increased operating margins from continuing strong global demand for protein meal and vegetable oil and to higher volumes and margins related to origination and fertilizer operations.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results decreased $ 11 million for the quarter and $ 21 million for the twelve months due principally to asset impairment charges of   $ 9 million for the quarter and $ 27 million for the year.  Last years twelve months refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results include a $ 14 million gain from business disposals.
 
 
 
Corn Processing Operating Profit
 
 
Corn Processing operating profit increased $ 33 million for the quarter and decreased $ 144 million for the twelve months.  Average selling prices for sweeteners and starches increased for both the quarter and twelve months while average ethanol selling prices decreased slightly.  Ethanol sales volumes increased for both the quarter and the twelve months due to good demand and improved gasoline blending economics.  Ethanol sales volumes also increased due to additional sales of merchandised product.  Net corn costs were relatively unchanged for the quarter but were higher for the year.  Manufacturing costs increased for both the quarter and twelve months due principally to higher energy-related costs.

Agricultural Services Operating Profit
 
 
Agricultural Services results decreased $ 140 million for the quarter due primarily to last years $ 153 million gain resulting from the sale of the Companys interest in Agricore United.  Agricultural Services results increased $ 479 million for the twelve months due principally to enhanced merchandising and handling margins caused by the highly volatile grain markets and favorable risk management results partially offset by higher operating costs and last years $ 153 million gain from the Agricore United disposal.
 
 
 
 
Other Operating Profit
 
 
Other operating profit decreased $ 51 million for the quarter and increased $ 44 million for the twelve months.  Wheat, cocoa and malt operations declined $ 21 million for the quarter and increased $ 8 million for the twelve months due principally to lower equity earnings of affiliates and decreased cocoa processing margins, partially offset by improved malt operating margins.  Last years twelve month results include a   $ 39 million gain from business disposals.  Financial earnings declined $ 30 million for the quarter due primarily to lower valuations of the Companys managed fund investments.  Financial earnings increased $ 36 million for the twelve months due principally to higher brokerage services income.

Corporate Results
 
 
Corporate results decreased $ 480 million for the quarter and $ 810 million for the year due principally to increases in LIFO charges of $ 138 million for the quarter and $ 362 million for the year and to securities gains recorded in the prior year of  $ 363 million and $ 374 million for the fourth quarter and year respectively.  Corporate costs increased $ 13 million for the quarter and $ 51 million for the year due principally to increased reorganization and realignment costs.  Other principally represents the elimination of after-tax earnings of minority interests.
