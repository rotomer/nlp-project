ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Companys strong financial condition, global network enhance ability to act on opportunities
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced record quarterly net earnings of $ 1.05 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, up 138 % from the period a year ago.  Net sales increased 65 % to $ 21.16 billion.
 
This record quarter again demonstrates the ability of our people to utilize our integrated global network and financial strength to capitalize on opportunities and further affirms our business model and strategy, said Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz.  Our strong balance sheet and credit rating provide us with the flexibility to access the most cost-efficient credit markets.  Our market acumen coupled with this financial strength enables us to recognize and promptly act upon opportunities when they arise.

    Financial Highlights
Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income increased 65 % to $ 21.16 billion due principally to higher selling prices resulting primarily from sharp rises in underlying commodity costs and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange translation impacts.  Sales volumes were comparable.
A summary of first quarter segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Net earnings increased $ 609 million due principally to a $ 379 million increase in segment operating profit and from the positive impact on Corporate results of the change in LIFO inventory valuations.  In addition, income taxes increased due principally to increased pretax earnings, partially offset by a decreased effective tax rate resulting from changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds Processing operating profit increased $ 301 million to $ 510 million from $ 209 million last year. Crushing and origination results increased $ 208 million due principally to improved global crush margins primarily related to favorable raw material positioning.  Origination margins increased in Europe and South America and fertilizer results improved in South America due principally to increased sales volumes. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 44 million due principally to improved refining margins and improved biodiesel margins in Europe and South America.  In addition, biodiesel sales volumes in South America increased due to the recently-opened plant in Rondonopolis, Brazil.  Asia results increased $ 49 million due principally to increased equity earnings related to our investment in Wilmar International Ltd.
 
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 135 million to $ 118 million from $ 253 million last year.  Sweeteners and Starches operating profit decreased $ 102 million to $ 65 million due principally to sharply higher net corn and energy costs, partially offset by increased sales volumes and higher average selling prices. Bioproducts operating profit decreased $ 33 million to $ 53 million due principally to higher net corn and energy costs partially offset by higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes for ethanol and lysine.  Net corn costs were negatively impacted this quarter by mark-to-market losses on corn futures and options used to economically hedge sales obligations.

Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services results increased $ 199 million to $ 428 million due principally to improved global merchandising and handling margins resulting from opportunities created by volatile commodity and freight market conditions, global shifts in the sources of grain supplies and the delayed U.S. harvest.  Transportation results were similar as lower barge freight volumes and increased operating costs were partially offset by increased barge freight rates.
 
Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit increased $ 14 million due principally to improved operating margins in wheat and cocoa, higher equity earnings of affiliates and increased sales volumes of cocoa and chocolate products partially offset by decreased interest income from the Companys brokerage services business and reduced income from the Companys managed fund investments.  Wheat, cocoa and malt includes one-time gains of $ 9 million related to the disposal of the Companys Malt business.
 
Corporate Results
Corporate results increased $ 468 million due principally to a LIFO credit of $ 453 million compared to a LIFO charge of $ 83 million last year.  Investment income/(expense) decreased $ 65 million primarily due to increased interest expense.
