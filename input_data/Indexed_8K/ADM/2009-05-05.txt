Two significant, negative items related to equity investments impacted results
 
Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced net earnings of $ 8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, including a $ 132 million non-cash after-tax charge related to currency derivative losses of the Companys equity investee, Gruma S.A.B. de C.V., and a $ 97 million income tax charge related to the Companys investment in Wilmar International Limited.  Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 were $ 517 million.  Net sales and other operating income decreased 21 % to $ 14.8 billion.
 
While the quarterly results were adversely impacted by two significant, unusual items, our underlying performance was solid in view of the global economic conditions and the associated challenges faced by our industry, said Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Patricia Woertz.  Our financial condition is strong and we remain focused on managing risks and costs as we execute our long-term growth strategy.

 Financial Highlights
(Amounts in millions, except per share data and percentages)
 
Discussion of Operations
 
Net sales and other operating income decreased 21 % to $ 14.8 billion for the quarter and increased 10 % to $ 52.7 billion for the nine months.  For the quarter, decreased average selling prices, resulting principally from price moderation of underlying commodity costs and foreign exchange translation impacts, accounted for approximately 85 % of the decline, the remainder attributable to decreased sales volumes.  Year-to-date net sales and other operating income increased 10 % due principally to increased average selling prices resulting primarily from higher underlying commodity costs partially offset by decreased sales volumes.
A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Segment operating profit decreased $ 659 million for the quarter and decreased $ 420 million for the nine months.  Corporate results increased $ 56 million and $ 806 million for the quarter and nine months, respectively.  Income taxes decreased $ 94 million for the quarter and increased $ 173 million for the nine months.  Income taxes for the quarter and nine months include a $ 97 million income tax charge resulting from the restructuring of the holding company structure in which the Company holds a portion of its equity investment in Wilmar International Limited.  Excluding this $ 97 million income tax charge, income tax rates were broadly comparable and income tax expense changed in line with changes in pre-tax income.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased $ 13 million for the quarter and increased $ 387 million for the nine months. Crushing and origination results decreased $ 79 million for the quarter due principally toweaker North American crushing margins and weaker fertilizer margins in South America, as the economic slowdown reduced product demand.  Crushing and origination results increased $ 175 million for the nine months due principally to improved global crushing and origination margins partially offset by lower fertilizer sales volumes and margins.  Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 13 million for the quarter primarily due to improved margins for edible soy proteins.  In addition, refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results for the nine months improved due to increased biodiesel sales volumes and margins in South America and the absence of asset abandonment charges of $ 18 million included in the nine months ended March 31, 2008.  Asia results increased $ 53 million for the quarter and $ 116 million for the nine months due principally to improved earnings related to equity investments, principally Wilmar International Limited, and a gain of $ 18 million from the disposal of an equity investment.
 
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing operating profit decreased $ 123 million for the quarter and $ 503 million for the nine months. Sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $ 44 million for the quarter primarily due to higher average selling prices partially offset by higher net corn costs and lower sales volumes.  Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $ 67 million for the nine months due principally to higher net corn costs partially offset by higher average selling prices.  Bioproducts operating profit decreased $ 167 million for the quarter and $ 436 million for the nine months due principally to a significant decline in ethanol margins resulting from higher net corn costs, lower average selling prices and inventory write-downs.

Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services operating profit decreased $ 245 million for the quarter as global supplies of agricultural commodities increased, while demand slowed resulting in a contraction in merchandising and handling opportunities this quarter.  Year-to-date merchandising and handling operating profit increased $ 77 million due principally to improved margins resulting from opportunities created by volatile commodity and freight market conditions.  Transportation results increased for the quarter due principally to reduced operating costs partially offset by lower barge freight rates.  Transportation results for the nine months increased primarily due to higher barge freight rates.
 
Other Operating Profit
Other operating profit decreased $ 278 million for the quarter and $ 405 million for the nine months.  Wheat, cocoa, malt and sugar operating profit decreased $ 213 million for the quarter and $ 174 million for the nine months due principally to lower equity earnings from the Companys investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. primarily related to foreign currency derivative losses.  Financial operating profit decreased $ 65 million for the quarter and $ 231 million for the nine months due principally to losses on managed fund investments, increased captive insurance loss provisions and decreased interest income of the Companys brokerage services business.

Corporate Results
 
Corporate results increased $ 56 million for the quarter and $ 806 million for the nine months due principally to LIFO charges of $ 5 million for the quarter and LIFO credits of $ 571 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2009 compared to LIFO charges of $ 64 million and $ 371 million for the quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2008, respectively.
