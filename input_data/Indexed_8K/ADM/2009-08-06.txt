     Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced that Donald E. Felsinger has been appointed to its Board of Directors. He has been appointed to serve on the Board's Compensation/Succession and Nominating/Corporate Governance committees. His appointment, which increases the Board's size to 10 members, was effective August 5, 2009.
     Felsinger is Chairman and CEO of Sempra Energy, a San Diego-based Fortune 500 energy services company.
     "Don's exceptional track record of leading high-performance, global organizations will be invaluable to the ADM Board," said ADM Chairman, CEO and President Patricia A. Woertz. "I am confident we will benefit tremendously from his expertise, insights and strategic counsel."
     Since 2006, Felsinger has held his current position at Sempra, whose subsidiaries provide electricity, natural gas and value-added products and services to 29 million consumers worldwide. He previously had been the company's president and chief operating officer, and from 1998 to 2004, Felsinger served as group president of Sempra Global, the umbrella for Sempra Energy's businesses operating in competitive energy markets. In that role, he led the company's successful expansion into power generation, energy infrastructure development, energy trading and marketing, and liquefied natural gas development.
     Prior to the merger that formed Sempra Energy, Felsinger was president and chief operating officer of Enova Corporation. Earlier, he was president and chief executive officer of San Diego Gas & Electric.
     Felsinger serves as a director of the Northrop Grumman Corporation and as a member of the Conference Board, the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy, and the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. He is a graduate of the Stanford University executive program and holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Arizona.
