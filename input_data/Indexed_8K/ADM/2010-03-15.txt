Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits   The following exhibit is filed herewith:
99.1 Press Release of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company dated March 12, 2010.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
     Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today announced the results of its previously announced cash tender offers for $500 million principal amount of its outstanding debentures (the "Debentures"), which expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on March 11, 2010.
     The table below identifies the principal amount of each series of Debentures validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the tender offers based on information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the depositary and information agent. The table also identifies the principal amount of each series of Debentures that ADM has accepted for purchase under the terms of the Offer to Purchase dated February 11, 2010.
     As the aggregate principal amount of Debentures tendered exceeds the $500 million tender cap, Debentures will be purchased in accordance with the applicable acceptance priority level and prorated as provided in the Offer to Purchase. As previously announced, the tender offers for ADM's 6.625% Debentures due May 2029 (CUSIP No. 039483AR3), 6.75% Debentures due December 2027 (CUSIP No. 039483AN2) and 8.375% Debentures due April 2017 (CUSIP No. 039483AH5) representing the lowest priority levels in the original tender offers were terminated and, therefore, these series are not included in the table above. Any tendered Debentures not accepted will be promptly returned to the holders thereof.
     For additional information regarding the tender offers, please contact the dealer managers, Barclays Capital Inc. at (800) 438-3242 (toll free) or (212) 528-7581 (collect), BNP Paribas Securities Corp. at (212) 841-3059 (collect), or HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. at (888) HSBC-4LM (toll free) or (212) 525-5552 (collect) or the information agent, D.F.
