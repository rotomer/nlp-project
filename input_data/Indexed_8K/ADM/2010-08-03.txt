A summary of segment operating profit and net earnings is as follows:
Discussion of Operations
Net earnings for the fourth quarter increased $ 388 million due to a $ 591 million pretax increase in segment operating profit, partially offset by higher corporate expense and a $ 111 million increase in income tax expense. Income tax expense increased due primarily to higher pretax earnings. Last years fourth quarter income tax expense included favorable currency-translation impacts, partially offset by charges related to the restructuring of ADMs investment in Wilmar International, Ltd.
 
 
For the full fiscal year, net earnings increased $ 246 million due to a $ 786 million pretax increase in segment operating profit, partially offset by higher corporate expense which included a $ 296 million after-tax negative impact from changing LIFO inventory valuations. The Companys effective income tax rate for the year declined to 25.8 percent, compared to 32.5 percent for the year prior, mostly due to the absence of last years $ 158 million charge related to the restructuring of ADMs investment in Wilmar International, Ltd.

Oilseeds Processing Operating Profit
Profit in ADMs Oilseeds Processing segment increased $ 132 million for the quarter and $ 120 million for the 12 months.
Crushing and origination results increased $ 77 million to $ 218 million for the quarter. Year-over-year crushing volumes increased in the quarter, with decreased North American volumes more than offset by increases in South America and Europe. Good positioning favorably impacted North American and European soybean and softseed crushing margins.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results increased $ 58 million to $ 79 million for the quarter. Recently expanded biodiesel production capacity at Rondonopolis, Brazil, allowed ADM to capture good margins and volumes amidst strong demand. Last years quarter also included charges related to the formation of the Stratas Foods packaged-oil joint venture.
Asia results of $ 62 million for the quarter reflect ADMs share of Wilmar International, Ltd. earnings.
Corn Processing Operating Profit
Corn Processing results increased $ 151 million for the quarter and $ 537 million for the
12 months. 
 
Sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $ 30 million from the prior year to
$ 119 million. This decrease reflects lower average selling prices that were only partially offset by lower net corn costs. Sales volumes increased due to strong export demand.
Bioproducts profit in the quarter was up significantly from last years loss due to better ethanol and lysine margins.
At present, ADM has begun production at its Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ethanol dry mill, which should be fully operational by the end of August. And, in Decatur, Ill., the Company is working through startup issues at its propylene glycol plant, which should be fully operational by end of the calendar year.
Agricultural Services Operating Profit
Agricultural Services results increased $ 195 million for the quarter and decreased $ 326 million for the 12 months.
In the quarter, ADM saw a good global supply of grains and oilseeds and modestly
improving demand, especially from Asia.
Merchandising and handling profit improved significantly due principally to more favorable risk management results. Earnings from transportation operations declined on lower barge-freight rates and higher fuel costs.

Other Operating Profit
Results from ADMs Other business units increased $ 113 million for the quarter and
$ 455 million for the 12 months.
Other processing businesses were up $ 108 million for the quarter, reflecting improved results of ADMs cocoa and flour milling operations and from equity investee Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. Other processing earnings for the quarter include mark-to-market gains of $ 63 million related to certain forward sales commitments accounted for as derivatives.
 
 
Other financial results in the quarter increased $ 5 million due primarily to the absence of losses experienced last year in managed fund investments.
Corporate Results
Corporate results decreased $ 95 million for the quarter and $ 701 million for the 12 months. Rising commodity prices generated a $ 23 million increase in ADMs LIFO inventory valuation reserves this quarter, compared to a $ 54 million increase a year ago. For the year, LIFO inventory valuation reserves decreased $ 42 million, compared to a $ 517 million decrease last year.  The quarter and 12 months include $ 59 million of unrealized loss on interest rate swaps. The 12 months include higher net interest expense of $ 91 million and debt buyback costs of $ 75 million.

Certain amounts in the prior years Consolidated Statement of Earnings, Segment Operating Analysis, Summary of Financial Condition, and Summary of Cash Flows have been restated, and presentation formats have been modified to apply the requirements of new accounting standards ASC Topic 810, Consolidation and ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options.
