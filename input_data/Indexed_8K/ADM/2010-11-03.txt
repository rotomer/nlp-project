Exhibit 10.1
     This Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the "Agreement"), is made and entered into as of November 1, 2010, (the "Date of Grant"), by and between Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Steven R. Mills, an employee of the Company (the "Grantee"). This Agreement is pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The applicable terms of the Plan are incorporated herein by reference, including the definition of capitalized terms contained in the Plan.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
          . . The Company hereby grants to the Grantee, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, an Award with respect to 49,375 shares of the Company's common stock under the Plan (the "Restricted Shares").

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Grantee shall be entitled, at all times on and after the Date of Grant, to exercise all rights of a shareholder with respect to the Restricted Shares (whether or not the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed), including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and the right to receive cash dividends thereon (subject to applicable tax withholding). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the expiration of the Period of Restriction, the Grantee shall not be entitled to transfer, sell, pledge, alienate, hypothecate or assign the Restricted Shares. All rights with respect to the Restricted Shares shall be available only to the Grantee during his lifetime, and thereafter to the Grantee's estate.

Rights of Grantee
          . . Subject to the provisions of Sections 6 and 7 hereof, the restrictions on the Restricted Shares shall lapse and the Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall vest in (2) equal installments on November 1, 2011 and November 1, 2012 (the period from the Date of Grant until the applicable vesting date shall be referred to as a "Period of Restriction"). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3 or Section 6, but subject to Section 7 hereof, the restrictions on the Restricted Shares shall lapse and the Restricted Shares granted hereunder shall vest upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in Appendix A hereto).

Grantee or his estate. While the certificates representing the Restricted Shares are held by the Company, and if so requested by the Company, the Grantee will provide to the Company assignments separate from such certificates, in blank, signed by the Grantee to be held by the Company during the Period of Restriction. Certificates representing the Restricted Shares shall be delivered to the Grantee as soon as practicable following the expiration of the Period of Restriction, provided that the Grantee has satisfied any applicable Withholding Taxes in accordance with Section 8 hereof.

Each stock certificate shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: "This Certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture, restrictions against transfer and rights of repurchase, if applicable) contained in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement (the "Agreement") between the registered owner of the shares represented hereby and the Company. Release from such terms and conditions shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, a copy of which is on file in the office of the Company's Secretary."

          . . If the Grantee's service as an Employee ends for any reason prior to the end of a Period of Restriction, the Grantee shall forfeit the unvested Restricted Shares, which shall be returned to the treasury of the Company; provided that in the event such termination of service is (i) by the Grantee following material change in Grantee's terms of employment not anticipated as of this date, by the Company without "cause" (as defined in Section 7), or a result of Grantee's Disability then the Restricted Shares shall not be forfeited and shall, subject to the forfeiture provisions of Section 7 hereof, continue to vest in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) a result of Grantee's death then any applicable restrictions upon unvested Restricted Shares shall lapse and the Company shall deliver to the Grantee's estate certificates in respect of the Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 4 hereof.
