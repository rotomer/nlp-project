On September 26, 2011, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ("ADM") issued $527,681,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.535% Debentures due 2042 (the "New Debentures") in exchange for specified series of ADM's outstanding debt securities, in connection with the expiration of the early participation period for its previously announced exchange offers. The New Debentures were issued to qualified institutional buyers ("QIBs") pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The New Debentures were issued under an indenture, dated as of September 20, 2006, between ADM and The Bank of New York Mellon (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as trustee. The New Debentures will pay interest on March 26 and September 26 of each year, beginning March 26, 2012, at a rate of 4.535% per annum. The New Debentures are ADM's senior obligations and rank equally with all of its other unsecured indebtedness. The New Debentures are subject to optional redemption prior to maturity. The New Debentures issuable to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act were issued in the form of registered global securities in the form of debentures attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto (the "Rule 144 A Global Debenture"), and the New Debentures issuable to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act were issued in the form of registered global securities in the form of debentures attached as Exhibit 4.2 hereto (the "Regulation S Global Debenture"). The description of the New Debentures contained herein is qualified by reference to the form of Rule 144A Global Debenture and form of Regulation S Global Debenture attached hereto.
On September 26, 2011, in connection with the issuance of the New Debentures, ADM entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the dealer managers for the exchange offers named therein. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, ADM has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to allow holders of the New Debentures to exchange such New Debentures for an equal principal amount of debentures with substantially identical terms, except that they will generally be freely transferable under the Securities Act. In addition, ADM has agreed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, under certain circumstances, to file a shelf registration statement with the SEC to cover resales of the New Debentures. If ADM fails to satisfy these obligations, it will be required to pay additional interest as liquidated damages to the holders of the New Debentures. The Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3, and the description of the Registration Rights Agreement contained herein is qualified by reference thereto.
The New Debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. Therefore, the New Debentures may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated herein and referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON
as Trustee
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as September 20, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount in accordance with the terms of the exchange offers described in the Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Company dated as of September 8, 2011; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of September 26, 2011, by and among the Company and the Dealer Managers, as defined therein (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In the event of a Registration Default (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), additional interest shall accrue on the Securities of this series over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities of this series from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults, at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the first occurrence of a Registration Default, which shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum with respect to all Registration Defaults. Any such additional interest shall be paid to the same Persons, at the same times and in the same manner as ordinary interest on the Securities of this series. Any Exchange Debenture (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Security shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Security. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Security and the issue of an Exchange Debenture in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Security in connection with the exchange.
The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) if the Quotation Agent obtains four or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, after excluding the highest and lowest of such quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, the notice of such redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control
payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
"Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
"Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
"Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event). If any rating agency is not providing a rating of the Securities of this series on any day during the relevant period for any reason and the Company has not selected a replacement rating agency pursuant to the terms of the Securities of this series, the rating of such rating agency shall be deemed to be below an investment grade rating on such day and such rating agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the Securities of this series during the relevant period.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.
As provided in the Indenture, defeasance may occur at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness of the Company on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and the related defaults and Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Security.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each or all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.
provided
however
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the times, places, and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in global or definitive registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount.

This Security, if in global form, is exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form only if (x) The Depository Trust Company (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this global Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company has not appointed a successor Depository within 90 days of that notice or of its becoming aware of such cessation, (y) the Company in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depository determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing, provided that the definitive Securities so issued in exchange for this permanent global Security shall be in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this permanent global Security to be exchanged. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this permanent global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive registered form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture.
Any Security in global form that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.
Neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to the due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes (subject to the provisions of the Indenture), whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the
series designated herein and referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as September 20, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, limited in aggregate principal amount in accordance with the terms of the exchange offers described in the Confidential Offering Memorandum of the Company dated as of September 8, 2011; provided, however, that the Company, without notice to or the consent of the Holders, may issue additional Securities of this series and thereby increase such principal amount in the future, on the same terms and conditions (except for issue date, public offering price and, if applicable, the date from which interest accrues and the first Interest Payment Date) and with the same CUSIP number as the Securities of this series.
The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement dated as of September 26, 2011, by and among the Company and the Dealer Managers, as defined therein (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In the event of a Registration Default (as such term is defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), additional interest shall accrue on the Securities of this series over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities of this series from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults, at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the first occurrence of a Registration Default, which shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period up to a maximum of 0.50% per annum with respect to all Registration Defaults. Any such additional interest shall be paid to the same Persons, at the same times and in the same manner as ordinary interest on the Securities of this series. Any Exchange Debenture (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) issued in exchange for this Security shall evidence the same continuing indebtedness as this Security. Under no circumstances shall the surrender of this Security and the issue of an Exchange Debenture in exchange therefor constitute new indebtedness or obligate the Company to repay the principal amount of this Security in connection with the exchange.
The Securities of this series are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time, in whole or in part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities of this series to be redeemed, and (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments.
In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, such payments will be discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points. A partial redemption of the Securities of this series may be effected by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for the Securities of this series.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities of this series to be redeemed.
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities of this series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"Treasury Rate," with respect to any Redemption Date, means the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue. In determining this rate, it is assumed that a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) is equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term (as measured from the Redemption Date) of the Securities of this series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) if the Quotation Agent obtains four or more Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of such quotations, after excluding the highest and lowest of such quotations, or (b) if the Quotation Agent obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (c) if only one reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"Quotation Agent" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer appointed by the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealers Quotations" mean, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Quotation Agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to any Security of this series, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; , that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced (solely for purposes of this definition) by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
provided, however
Notwithstanding Section 1104 of the Indenture, the notice of such redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof. The Company shall give the Trustee notice of the Redemption Price promptly after the calculation thereof and the Trustee shall not be responsible for such calculation.
This Security shall not be subject to any sinking fund.
If a change of control triggering event occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer (the "change of control offer") to each Holder of the Securities of this series to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the Securities of this series held by such Holder on the terms set forth in this Security. In the change of control offer, the Company will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the date of repurchase (the "change of control payment"). Within 30 days following any change of control triggering event or, at the Company's option, prior to any change of control, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control, a notice will be mailed to the Holders of the Securities of this series describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the change of control triggering event and offering to repurchase such Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "change of control
payment date"). The notice will, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the change of control, state that the offer to purchase is conditioned on the change of control triggering event occurring on or prior to the change of control payment date.
On the change of control payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Company will not be required to make a change of control offer upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by the Company and the third party repurchases all Securities of this series properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer. In addition, the Company will not repurchase any Securities of this series if there has occurred and is continuing on the change of control payment date an Event of Default, other than a default in the payment of the change of control payment upon a change of control triggering event.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities of this series as a result of a change of control triggering event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the Company will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series by virtue of any such conflict.
For purposes of the change of control offer provisions of the Securities of this series, the following terms will be applicable:
"Change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a change of control if (1) the Company becomes a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (2) either (A) the direct or indirect holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Company's voting stock immediately prior to that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this sentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the voting stock of such holding company.
"Change of control triggering event" means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event.
"Continuing directors" means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of Directors who (1) was a member of the Board of Directors on the date the Securities of this series were originally issued or (2) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to the Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of the Board of Directors at the time of such nomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of the Company's proxy statement in which such member was named as a nominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).
"Fitch" means Fitch Ratings.
"Investment grade rating" means a rating equal to or higher than BBB- (or the equivalent) by Fitch, Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody's and BBB- (or the equivalent) by S&P, and the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional rating agency or rating agencies selected by the Company.
"Moody's" means Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"Rating agencies" means (1) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (2) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the Securities of this series or fails to make a rating of such Securities publicly available for reasons outside of the Company's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Board of Directors) as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
"Rating event" means the rating on the Securities of this series is lowered by each of the rating agencies and such Securities are rated below an investment grade rating by each of the rating agencies on any day within the 60-day period (which 60-day period will be extended so long as the rating of the such Securities is under publicly announced consideration for a possible downgrade by any of the rating agencies) after the earlier of (1) the occurrence of a change of control and (2) public notice of the occurrence of a change of control or the Company's intention to effect a change of control; provided, however, that a rating event otherwise arising by virtue of a particular reduction in rating will not be deemed to have occurred in respect of a particular change of control (and thus will not be deemed a rating event for purposes of the definition of "change of control triggering event") if the rating agencies making the reduction in rating to which this definition would otherwise apply do not announce or publicly confirm or inform the Trustee in writing at the Company's request that the reduction was the result, in whole or in part, of any event or circumstance comprised of or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the applicable change of control (whether or not the applicable change of control has occurred at the time of the rating event). If any rating agency is not providing a rating of the Securities of this series on any day during the relevant period for any reason and the Company has not selected a replacement rating agency pursuant to the terms of the Securities of this series, the rating of such rating agency shall be deemed to be below an investment grade rating on such day and such rating agency will be deemed to have lowered its rating of the Securities of this series during the relevant period.
"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
"Voting stock" means, with respect to any specified "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) as of any date, the capital stock of such person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the board of directors of such person.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each or all series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; , , that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

This Security, if in global form, is exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form only if (x) The Depository Trust Company (the "Depository") notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for this global Security or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and the Company has not appointed a successor Depository within 90 days of that notice or of its becoming aware of such cessation, (y) the Company in its sole discretion and subject to the procedures of the Depository determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing, provided that the definitive Securities so issued in exchange for this permanent global Security shall be in denominations of $1,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000 above that amount and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this permanent global Security to be exchanged.

Any Security in global form that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be exchangeable for Securities of this series in definitive registered form registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.
Neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Section 4(h)
Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any such Holder specifically for inclusion therein and provided, further, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission of a material fact made in any preliminary Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this shall not inure to the benefit of any indemnified party under this indemnity agreement from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures concerned to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such party occurs under the circumstance where (i) the Company had previously furnished copies of the Prospectus to such indemnified party in accordance with the terms hereof and prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as applicable, to such person, (ii) to the extent required by applicable law, a copy of the final Prospectus was not sent or given to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as applicable, to such person and (iii) the untrue statement in or omission from the preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the final Prospectus. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.

Company Indemnitee
Section 7(a)
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the
Section 7
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (not to be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. An indemnifying party shall not be liable under this to any indemnified party regarding any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Section 7
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have an obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is
Section 7
Losses
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Exchange Offer and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; provided, however, that in no case shall any Dealer Manager who is a Holder of any New Debenture or Exchange Debenture be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the Fee applicable to such New Debenture, or in the case of an Exchange Debenture, applicable to the New Debenture that was exchangeable into such Exchange Debenture, in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer as set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to (x) the aggregate principal amount of Old Debentures exchanged in the Initial Exchange Offer (before deducting expenses), plus (y) the total amount of Additional Interest which the Company was not required to pay as a result of registering the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures covered by the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses, minus (z) the aggregate amount of Fees paid by the Company in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer under the Dealer Manager Agreement. Benefits received by the Dealer Managers shall be deemed to be equal to the aggregate amount of Fees received by the Dealer Managers in connection with the Initial Exchange Offer under the Dealer Manager Agreement, and benefits received by any Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as applicable, registered under the Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within
the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
(e) The provisions of this shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in this , and shall survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.

8. Underwritten Registrations.
(a) If any of the New Debentures covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders, subject to the reasonable approval of the Company.
(b) No Holder may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such Holder (i) agrees to sell such Holder's New Debentures on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements, and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
The Company has not, as of the date hereof, entered into, nor shall it on or after the date hereof, enter into, any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
9. No Inconsistent Agreements.
The provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Majority Holders (or, after the consummation of any Registered Exchange Offer in accordance with hereof, the Holders of a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the Exchange Debentures); provided that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of the Dealer Managers hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of the Dealer Managers against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may alternatively be given by the Majority Holders of the New Debentures or Exchange Debentures, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.
