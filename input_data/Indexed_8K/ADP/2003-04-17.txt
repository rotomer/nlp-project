FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADP REPORTS THIRD FISCAL QUARTER IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS; REVENUE RISES 2%, EPS DECLINES BY 4% ROSELAND, NJ, April 17, 2003 - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP) announced earnings per share of $.54 for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Revenues approximated $1.9 billion in the quarter, a 2% increase over last year. Pretax earnings declined 7% and net earnings declined 6% compared with last year. Diluted earnings per share, on fewer shares outstanding, declined 4% compared with last year. Commenting on the quarter, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Revenue growth was in line with our expectations for the third quarter. Employer Services, Dealer Services and Claims Services grew 6%, 15% and 1%, respectively. Brokerage Services' revenues declined 14%. Employer Services new business sales declined 8% driven by weaker results in our Major Accounts segment. Sales of our new payroll platforms, TotalChoice[SM] and Pay eXpert[R], which are primarily in Major Accounts, and Enterprise in National Accounts, were all strong. Client retention improved over 1.5% compared with last year. The number of employees on our clients' payrolls, or 'pays per control', declined about 1% in the quarter. "Brokerage Services' revenues and pretax earnings declined, as expected, given the weakness in the financial services industry. Our Brokerage Processing Services Division revenues declined 24%, as trades per day declined 26% in the quarter. Retail trades continued to be very weak. The current transaction levels in our back office trade processing business are running well below levels in our first half of fiscal 2003. Therefore, if transaction volumes and retail mix continue at current levels, we will experience declining revenues in our back office trade processing business at least through the first half of fiscal 2004. Investor Communications Division revenues declined 10% in the quarter due to low corporate actions and low mutual fund activity. "Interest income from funds held for clients decreased 8% despite higher average client fund balances. Interest income on corporate funds declined 18% from last year. Based on current interest rates we would expect our yield on combined corporate and client fund investments to decline in fiscal 2004, which would result in approximately $50 to $100 million lower interest earnings depending on overall investment balances.
-2- "We continue with our guidance for fiscal 2003 of $1.68 - $1.73 earnings per share with flat revenues compared with last year. Last month we announced an acceleration of activity in three critical areas: 1) increased spending in product development and infrastructure in our core new products, where demand is outpacing our capacity, 2) cost reductions in selected areas including exiting non-performing businesses and 3) investments in the retention of quality associates. We are on track to spend between $150 and $200 million on these three major initiatives. We have started the process of accelerating investment in new products. The incremental expense will begin in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and continue to increase well into fiscal 2004. We made progress with restructuring initiatives, which resulted in approximately $10 million of incremental charges, primarily severance in our Brokerage Services business, in the third quarter. During the quarter we also divested our Quality Rehabilitation Services business, with annual revenues of less than $20 million, which was part of the Medical Claims division of Claims Services. There was no material gain or loss on the transaction. The expenses related to incremental "Employer of Choice" initiatives will begin in fiscal 2004. "In fiscal 2003 we have acquired over 25 million shares of ADP stock for treasury for approximately $865 million reflecting our confidence in the long-term growth of our businesses," Mr. Weinbach concluded. ADP, with $7 billion in revenues and more than 500,000 clients, is one of the largest independent computing services firms in the world.
