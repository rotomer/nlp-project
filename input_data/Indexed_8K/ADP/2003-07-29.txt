FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADP FISCAL 2003 REVENUE RISES 2%, EPS DECLINES 4% TO $1.68; FORECASTS MID-SINGLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH AND $1.50 - $1.60 EPS FOR FISCAL 2004 ROSELAND, NJ, July 29, 2003 - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP) reported 2% revenue growth and $1.68 earnings per share for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer, announced today. Revenues of $7.1 billion increased 2% over last year. Pretax and net earnings declined 8% compared with last year. Diluted earnings per share, on fewer shares outstanding, declined 4% from $1.75 per share last year. During fiscal 2003, ADP acquired over 27 million shares of its stock for approximately $940 million reflecting confidence in the long-term growth of the businesses. With cash and marketable securities of $2.3 billion, operating cash flows of $1.6 billion for the year, and only $85 million of debt, ADP is well positioned for future growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, revenues increased 4% to $1.9 billion. Pretax and net earnings decreased 25% compared with last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per share, on fewer shares outstanding, declined to $0.36 per share from $0.46 per share in fiscal 2002. Commenting on the year, Mr. Weinbach said, "In fiscal 2003, the weak economy impacted Employer Services, Brokerage Services and interest income in a significant way. Employer Services' revenues grew 5% despite a 2% decline in new business sales and a 1% decline in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls during the year. Client retention improved 1%. Brokerage Services' revenues declined 9% based on the weakness in the financial services industry which affected our primarily volume-based back office processing and investor communication activities. Dealer Services' revenues grew 12%, and Claims Services' revenues were approximately the same as last year. Lower interest rates reduced interest income on funds held for clients 14%, despite 7% growth during the year in average client fund balances to $8.9 billion. "In March we announced plans to accelerate investments in our most promising key products and in our associates, and to restructure under-performing businesses. Our fiscal 2003 results include approximately $60 million of incremental restructuring charges to exit certain businesses and reduce costs in slow growth areas, most of which occurred in the fourth quarter. The restructuring charges were primarily related to severance, including charges to exit our Medical Claims business within Claims Services and a small payroll business servicing primarily government agencies, separate from our core payroll business, in the United Kingdom. "As we look ahead, we are assuming little improvement in the economic environment. Our guidance for fiscal 2004 is mid-single digit revenue growth, and earnings per share of $1.50 - $1.60. This outlook reflects the ongoing impact of the weak economy on Employer Services and Brokerage Services, as well as lower interest rates compared with last year, which we anticipate will cause a decline in interest income on corporate and client funds of $60 - $80 million from fiscal 2003. In addition, we will invest an incremental $90 - $100 million in our highest growth opportunities, primarily in Employer Services' products such as the TotalChoiceSM, PayeXpert(R) and Enterprise platforms. We will also spend $40 - $45 million on Employer of Choice initiatives aimed at retaining our quality associates. "We are seeing growth opportunities where positive early market reaction to our new offerings clearly justifies an increased level of investment. Our business model and financial strength provide us the ability to pursue these opportunities even in times of economic uncertainty," Mr. Weinbach concluded. An analyst conference call to review the fiscal 2003 results will be held today, Tuesday, July 29th at 1:30PM EDT.
