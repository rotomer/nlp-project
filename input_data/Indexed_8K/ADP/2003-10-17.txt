ADP REPORTS 4% REVENUE GROWTH FOR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER; EPS DECLINES 6% ROSELAND, NJ, October 17, 2003 - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP) reported 4% revenue growth and $.32 earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer, announced today. Revenues of $1.7 billion increased 4% over last year. Pretax earnings declined 9% and net earnings declined 7%. Diluted earnings per share declined 6% from $.34 per share last year. Commenting on the quarter, Mr. Weinbach said, "The primary reasons for the earnings decline are the previously disclosed reductions in interest rates, the weakness in the brokerage industry and the overall economy, and our incremental investment activity. Nevertheless, earnings were slightly stronger than our expectations, although some of our key indicators of future performance remained mixed. Revenues in Employer Services grew 10% with internal revenue growth of 5%. Employer Services' new business sales declined 4% from a year ago, which is slightly behind our plan. Client retention continues to be strong, improving slightly over last year's record retention levels. While our plans contemplated flat employment throughout the fiscal year, we had a decline of less than 0.5% in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls in the first quarter. As expected, our margin in Employer Services declined due to previously announced accelerated investments as well as the integration of June's ProBusiness Services acquisition. Dealer Services' revenues grew 8% continuing the positive momentum from last year. Brokerage Services' revenues declined 13%. The decline from last year is based on lower back office trades per day, although above expectations, and lower investor communications activity. Claims Services' revenues declined 6%, primarily due to the previously announced exiting of our Medical Claims Business. "Our fiscal 2004 guidance for mid-single digit revenue growth and earnings per share of $1.50 - $1.60 remains unchanged. While we are slightly ahead of our planned results for the quarter, our incremental investment spending was slower than anticipated and will ramp-up over the fiscal year. We remain cautious on our full year estimate for sales growth in Employer Services, and our outlook continues to anticipate no change in the economy. We are optimistic about the incremental investments we are making in our businesses and their impact on our future growth opportunities," Mr. Weinbach concluded. An analyst conference call to review the first quarter results will be held today, Friday, October 17 at 1:30 p.m. EDT. A live audio webcast of the call will be available to the public on a listen-only basis. To listen to the webcast go to www.adp.com and click on the webcast icon.

(B) Prior year's segment results were adjusted to reflect fiscal year 2004 budgeted foreign exchange rates. In addition, Employer Services' prior year revenue was adjusted to include interest earned on client funds credited at 4.5%. Employer Services' revenues are credited with interest earned on client funds at a standard rate to better judge real business growth without the impact of changing interest rates. Given the sustained lower interest rates over recent years, ADP has changed the standard rate from 6.0% to 4.5%. A full description of segment information follows the balance sheet. The tables at the end of this release provide the adjusted quarterly segment data for the prior three fiscal years.

ADP evaluates performance of its business units based on operating results before interest on corporate funds, foreign currency gains and losses, and income taxes. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to business units at a standard rate for management and motivation reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility. Prior years' business unit revenues and earnings before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal year 2004 budgeted foreign exchange rates. In addition, Employer Services' prior years' revenues were adjusted to include interest earned on client funds credited at 4.5%. Prior to fiscal 2004, Employer Services was credited with interest earned on client funds at 6.0%. Given the decline in interest rates over recent years, the standard rate has been changed to 4.5%. Reconciling items for revenues and earnings before income taxes include foreign exchange differences between the actual foreign exchange rates and the fiscal 2004 budgeted foreign exchange rates and the adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services at a standard rate. The business unit results also include an internal cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is eliminated in consolidation and as such represents a reconciling item to earnings before income taxes. The tables below show the adjusted quarterly segment revenues and earnings before income taxes and reconciling items for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003.
