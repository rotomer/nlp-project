EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ P R E S S R E L E A S E - ------------------------- AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING TO ACQUIRE U.S. CLEARING AND BROKERDEALER SERVICES FROM BANK OF AMERICA ROSELAND, NJ, June 22, 2004 - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP), has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Services divisions of Bank of America Corporation, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer of ADP announced today. The transaction is subject to regulatory review and is expected to close before the end of the calendar year. Commenting on the transaction, Mr. Weinbach stated, "We are pursuing a business process outsourcing (BPO) strategy in response to market demand and in light of the changing dynamics of the financial services marketplace. The acquisition, with revenues of approximately $85 million, positions ADP Brokerage Services Group to provide both retail and institutional broker clients an integrated solution encompassing Brokerage Processing Services (Service Bureau), Operations Outsourcing and Clearing Services. Our BPO strategy strengthens the value proposition of our offerings to the financial services industry while it also opens the small and mid-tier broker-dealer segment to ADP for future growth. "We expect that the transaction will be approximately $.01 to $.02 per share dilutive in the first two years during the integration and the initial stages of the strategy adoption and accretive thereafter." ADP, with over $7 billion in revenues and approximately 500,000 clients, is one the largest independent computing services firms in the world.
