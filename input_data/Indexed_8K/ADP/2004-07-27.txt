ADP REPORTS FISCAL 2004 RESULTS REVENUES INCREASE 9%, EPS DECLINES 7% TO $1.56; FORECASTS MID-SINGLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH AND DOUBLE-DIGIT EPS GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2005 ROSELAND, NJ, July 27, 2004 - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP) reported 9% revenue growth for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, with revenues of $7.8 billion compared with $7.1 billion in fiscal 2003, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer, announced today. Pretax and net earnings declined 9% and 8%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share of $1.56 declined 7% from $1.68 per share last year on fewer shares outstanding. During fiscal 2004, ADP acquired nearly 16 million of its shares for treasury for approximately $650 million. Operating cash flows were $1.4 billion for the year, and cash and marketable securities were $2.1 billion at June 30, 2004. In the fourth quarter, revenues of $2.1 billion increased 9% compared with $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Pretax and net earnings declined 3% and 2%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share of $0.36, on fewer shares outstanding, were flat with last year's fourth quarter. Commenting on the results, Mr. Weinbach said, "We concluded the year in line with our expectations. Employer Services' revenues grew 9% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. The positive momentum in new business sales continued with 19% growth for the quarter resulting in 6% growth for the full year. The number of employees on our clients' payrolls, "pays per control," continued to rebound in the United States with 1.5% growth in the quarter and 0.4% growth for the full year. In Europe, "pays per control" continued to decline but at a lower rate than earlier in the year. Average client fund balances have been strong with 24% growth for the year, half of which was contributed by last year's acquisition of ProBusiness Services. "Brokerage Services' revenues grew 5% in the quarter and 3% for the year. During the quarter we divested "OMR," our foreign exchange, money markets and derivatives products business with revenues of about $25 million annually. Our quarter and full year results in Brokerage Services were helped by 15% growth in investor communications pieces delivered reflecting more holders of equities and incremental activity from recent mutual fund regulatory oversight. Dealer Services' revenues grew 13% in the quarter and 9% for the full year supported by strong sales growth of 13% for the year and continuing excellent retention. Claims Services' revenues increased 12% in the quarter primarily due to the acquisition of the ABZ Group B.V. in the Netherlands in our third quarter. Claims Services' revenues were flat with last year on a full year basis. "As our business continued to improve in the quarter, and consistent with our April 22, 2004 projection, we accelerated about $30 million of non-recurring charges which are included in the results of each business. Including these non-recurring charges, our total investment spending for fiscal 2004 was about $170 million. Our investment expense during the year, excluding the $30 million non-recurring charges, was about $20 million, $30 million, $40 million and $50 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. On an ongoing basis our run rate will be about $45 million quarterly, or about $180 million on a full year basis. "Our outlook for fiscal 2005 is positive. We are beginning to see the benefit of our investments in our associates, products and services, and our sales force. Our associate retention is good at almost 90% retention worldwide. Client retention is excellent across all businesses and especially in Employer Services where we improved retention almost 1% in 2004 compared to record levels a year ago. We are gaining momentum in sales, particularly in Employer Services and Dealer Services where, in both businesses, we finished the year strong and have double-digit sales growth expectations for 2005. "Our fiscal 2005 guidance is for mid-single digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. The forecast is based on current economic conditions. Our interest assumptions are based on current yield curves. We are assuming no further improvement in "pays per control," and a 3% increase in investor communications pieces delivered with lower mutual fund mailings related to regulatory oversight. We anticipate closing our previously announced acquisition of the U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Services division of Bank of America Corporation before the end of the calendar year with about $.01 dilution in fiscal 2005. "Although we are forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth for fiscal 2005, we expect to start the year slower with lower growth early in the year. We expect earnings growth to accelerate throughout the year as we anticipate more favorable interest rate comparisons and we anniversary investment spending levels that increased throughout fiscal 2004. "Fiscal 2004 was an important transition year for ADP. The appropriate investments have been made. We now face the future well positioned for the challenges of fiscal 2005 and the longer term," Mr. Weinbach concluded. An analyst conference call to review the fiscal 2004 results will be held today, Tuesday, July 27 at 1:30 p.m. EDT.
