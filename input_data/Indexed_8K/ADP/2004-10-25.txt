FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADP REPORTS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER RESULTS; REVENUES GROW 8%, EPS INCREASES 9% TO $.35; FISCAL 2005 REVENUE GUIDANCE RAISED TO 7-8% GROWTH; DOUBLE-DIGIT EPS GUIDANCE REMAINS UNCHANGED ROSELAND, NJ, October 25, 2004 - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP) reported 8% revenue growth and $.35 earnings per share for the first quarter ended September 30, 2004, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer, announced today. Revenues approximated $1.9 billion compared with $1.7 billion in fiscal 2004. Pretax and net earnings grew 6% and 7%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share of $.35 increased 9% from $.32 per share last year on fewer shares outstanding. Commenting on the results, Mr. Weinbach said, "I am pleased with our progress and improving results. We are ahead of our expectations in each of our businesses with positive key indicators for future growth in Employer and Brokerage Services. Employer Services' revenues grew 6% in the quarter. New business sales grew 14%, continuing the momentum of double-digit sales growth from the second half of fiscal 2004. Sales were particularly strong in our National Accounts segment and in TotalSource, our Professional Employer Organization (PEO). The number of employees on our clients' payrolls, "pays per control," increased 1.8% in the United States. This employment metric represents over 125 thousand payrolls across a broad range of U.S. geographies ranging from small to very large businesses. Client retention was ahead of last year's record level which is a reflection of our continued investment and commitment to client service. "Brokerage Services' revenues grew 6% in the quarter. Back-office trades per day increased 10% over last year, while retail trades continued to be weaker than our plan. In September we successfully added a major new client, E*TRADE FINANCIAL, to our back-office transaction processing business. Investor communications mailings increased 22% compared with last year, which was beyond our expectations, and reflects higher stock record growth and interim period mailings. Dealer Services' revenues grew 13% and Claims Services' revenues increased 8% in the quarter. Revenue growth in Dealer Services and Claims Services was favorably impacted by acquisitions made in fiscal 2004. "Our key metrics, with the exception of interest rates and brokerage retail trades, were strong compared to expectations in the first quarter and we are optimistic looking forward. With first quarter revenue growth ahead of our plans and the continued strong sales momentum, we are raising our revenue guidance to 7-8% growth from mid-single digit revenue growth. We are also increasingly confident in our earnings per share guidance of double-digit growth based on our better than planned first quarter results. This confidence is despite lower than expected interest income and incremental anticipated dilution from our Brokerage Services' acquisition later in the year. Short-term interest rates are in line with expectations; however, long-term rates have softened compared with our original plans. We expect to complete our previously announced acquisition of the U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Services division of Bank of America Corporation by early November, a couple of months ahead of schedule, with about $.02 dilution in fiscal 2005. "We have continued to acquire ADP shares for treasury. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we acquired nearly 5.5 million shares for approximately $220 million. Our cash and marketable securities balances were strong at $2.0 billion at September 30, 2004," Mr. Weinbach concluded. An analyst conference call to review the first quarter results will be held today, Monday, October 25 at 3:30 p.m. EDT.

ADP evaluates performance of its business units based on operating results before interest on corporate funds, foreign currency gains and losses, and income taxes. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to business units at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility. The prior years' business unit revenues and earnings before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal year 2005 budgeted foreign exchange rates. Reconciling items include foreign exchange differences between the actual foreign exchange rates and the fiscal year 2005 budgeted foreign exchange rates and the adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. The business unit results also include an internal cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is eliminated in consolidation and as such represents a reconciling item to earnings before income taxes. The tables below show the adjusted quarterly segment revenues and earnings before income taxes and reconciling items for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004, as well as the percentage difference between each period indicated and the same respective prior year period.
