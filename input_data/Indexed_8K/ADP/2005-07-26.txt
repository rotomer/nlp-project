FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADP REPORTS FISCAL 2005 RESULTS AND PROVIDES FISCAL 2006 REVENUE AND EPS GUIDANCE; FISCAL 2005 REVENUES RISE 10%; EPS INCREASES 15%; HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH AND 15% - 20% EPS GROWTH PROJECTED FOR FISCAL 2006 ROSELAND, NJ, July 26, 2005 - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP) reported 10% revenue growth to $8.5 billion and 15% earnings per share growth for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer, announced today. Pretax earnings grew 12% and net earnings grew 13% compared with last year. Diluted earnings per share of $1.79 increased 15% from $1.56 per share a year ago on fewer shares outstanding. In fiscal 2005, ADP acquired over 14 million shares of its stock for treasury for approximately $600 million. Cash and marketable securities balances were $2.1 billion at June 30, 2005. Operating cash flows reflect continued strength at $1.4 billion for the year. Revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were $2.3 billion, an increase of 10% compared with $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Pretax and net earnings both increased 22%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.44, on fewer shares outstanding, increased 22% compared with last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was impacted by lower severance and facility exit charges. Commenting on the results, Mr. Weinbach said, "Overall, ADP had an excellent year surpassing our expectations. The key metrics in Employer Services were the strongest they have been in five years. Employer Services' revenues increased 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. New business sales growth was 16% in the quarter on top of a strong fourth quarter a year ago. For the year, new business sales growth was 13% and all market segments achieved double-digit growth. We are particularly pleased that our stronger sales performance spans all segments and reflects the investment in our sales organization and new products. The number of employees on our clients' payrolls increased in all market segments in the United States with nearly 2% overall growth compared with last year and client retention improved 0.5% over last year's record level. Growth in average client balances during the year was strong at about 11%. We continue to build momentum in Employer Services with acceleration in Comprehensive Outsourcing Services, continued improvements in our beyond payroll category such as Time and Labor Management, and with features like the employee portal. "Brokerage Services' revenues grew 5% for both the quarter and the year compared with last year. Pretax earnings improved 9% for the quarter and 20% for the year compared with last year. Revenue growth for the year was primarily from our investor communications business as the volume of pieces delivered increased 15%, driven by an increase in mutual fund meetings and special communications, as well as 6% stock record growth. Back-office average trades per day decreased 1% for the quarter compared with last year and increased 7% for the year. The decline in the quarter was primarily in institutional volume. Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services' revenues were $61 million since its acquisition in November 2004 through June 30, 2005 and the pretax loss for the same period of $24 million was in line with our expectations. "Dealer Services' revenues grew 7% for the quarter and 10% for the year, and Claims Services revenues were flat for the quarter and grew 4% for the year. "As of July 1, 2005, using the modified prospective method, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, which requires the expensing of our stock compensation programs. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R is expected to lower earnings per share by $0.18 - $0.19 in fiscal 2006 and would have lowered earnings per share in fiscal 2005 by $0.22. This additional expense will be reflected in our "Other" Segment and not within the business segment results in our quarterly and annual SEC filings. The lower dilution anticipated in fiscal 2006 is primarily driven by the reduction in the number of options granted to associates beginning in fiscal 2005.
"Our fiscal 2006 guidance is high single-digit revenue growth and earnings per share growth of 15% - 20%, assuming stock compensation was expensed in fiscal 2005. Excluding stock compensation expense in both periods, we anticipate growth in earnings per share would have been 12% - 15%. Our plans reflect strong momentum in Employer Services with about 10% revenue growth in the United States and 9% worldwide, double-digit new business sales growth and continued improvement in client retention. Interest income on client funds is anticipated to grow over 20% based on expected growth of 9% in client fund balances and an improvement of over 30 basis points in the overall yield in the client funds portfolio. "Our revenue growth forecast is strongest in Employer Services, and ranges from mid- to high-single digit growth in our other segments. In fiscal 2005 we had over 1% of revenue growth from the impact of foreign currency exchange, which we are not anticipating will repeat in fiscal 2006. We are anticipating at least 1% margin improvement in each of our businesses. Our earnings growth is expected to be slightly lower in the first half of the fiscal year and improve steadily throughout the year. "We are very pleased with the results for the year and our forecast for fiscal 2006 and look with confidence to the future," Mr. Weinbach concluded.
