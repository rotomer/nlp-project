EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AUTOMATIC DATA PROCESSING, INC. ANNOUNCES SALE OF BUSINESS SIGNS AGREEMENT TO SELL CLAIMS SERVICES BUSINESS ROSELAND, NEW JERSEY - FEBRUARY 9, 2006 -- Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP), has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Claims Services business (CSG) to Solera, Inc. for $975 million in cash, Arthur F. Weinbach, chairman and chief executive officer of ADP announced today. Solera, a consulting, outsourced services, and strategic technology solutions company focused on the claims process, was formed in partnership with GTCR Golder Rauner, LLC, a leading private equity firm. ADP expects the transaction to close within 90 days, subject to normal regulatory review and customary closing conditions. Commenting on the transaction, Mr. Weinbach said, "As part of our strategic planning process, we continuously review our lines of business for their strategic fit. We concluded that given the size of CSG relative to our other core businesses, and with the current favorable M&A market conditions, it was timely to sell. We are pleased that Solera's experience, focus, and commitment to the industry will provide a positive experience for CSG's clients and associates." ADP expects to report a one-time pretax gain of approximately $600 million, or $450 million after tax, upon closing. CSG's results of operations will be treated as a discontinued business in future financial statements. Excluding the one-time gain, the transaction will be dilutive approximately $0.01 - $0.02 per share in fiscal 2006 and $0.07 per share in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 guidance, prior to the announcement of this transaction, was 10% revenue growth and 23% - 25% growth in earnings per share from continuing operations assuming stock compensation was expensed in both fiscal 2006 and 2005. As a result of the discontinued operations of CSG, fiscal 2006 revenue guidance remains unchanged at 10% growth, and forecasted earnings per share from continuing operations is updated to $1.83 - $1.86 compared with $1.48 last year on a comparable basis including stock compensation expense, an increase of 24% - 26%. "As a result of this transaction, we will review our capital allocation strategy with a view toward increasing share repurchases," Mr. Weinbach concluded. See accompanying tables at the end of this release for CSG revenues for fiscal 2005 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2006, and full year 2006 guidance presented with CSG reported within discontinued operations. As a result of this transaction, the following items will be adjusted to reflect the operations of CSG as a discontinued business and will be posted by February 14th to the investor relations home page (http://www.investquest.com/iq/a/aud/index.htm) of our website at www.adp.com under financial data: o Quarterly and full-year statements of earnings for fiscal 2005 (not adjusted for stock compensation expense) o Statements of earnings for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2006 o Tables containing fiscal 2005 quarterly detail adjusted for stock compensation expense o Historical revenue and pretax margin by business segment (periods prior to fiscal year 2006 are not adjusted for stock compensation expense) ADP, with $8.5 billion in revenues and approximately 590,000 clients worldwide, is one of the largest providers of a broad range of premier, mission-critical, cost-effective transaction processing and information-based business solutions.
