SEGMENT INFORMATION Employer Services, Brokerage Services, Dealer Services, and Securities Clearing & Outsourcing Services are ADP's reportable segments. ADP evaluates the performance of its segments based on operating results before interest on corporate funds, foreign currency gains and losses, and income taxes. Certain revenues and expenses are charged to the segments at a standard rate for management reasons. Other costs are recorded based on management responsibility. The prior years' segment revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal year 2006 budgeted foreign exchange rates. Reconciling items include foreign exchange differences between the actual foreign exchange rates and the fiscal year 2006 budgeted foreign exchange rates and the adjustment for the difference between actual interest income earned on invested funds held for clients and interest credited to Employer Services at a standard rate of 4.5%. The segment results also include an internal cost of capital charge related to the funding of acquisitions and other investments. This charge is eliminated in consolidation and as such represents a reconciling item to earnings before income taxes. The tables attached show the adjusted quarterly segment revenues and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and reconciling items for fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005, as well as the percentage difference between each period indicated and the same respective prior year period. Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005 have not been adjusted for the impact of stock compensation expense. Fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005 and the first and second quarters of 2006 (Q1 '06 and Q2 '06) were restated to reflect revenues and earnings before income taxes from continuing operations as a result of the decision to sell the Brokerage Services financial print business and the Claims Services business.
