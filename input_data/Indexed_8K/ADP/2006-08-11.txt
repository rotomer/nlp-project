Named Executive Officer Compensation
 
On August 10, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Automatic Data Processing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), approved (i) the annual base salary for fiscal year 2007 for each of Gary C. Butler, President, Chief Operating Officer and CEO-elect, S. Michael Martone, Group President (Employer Services), Richard J. Daly, Group President (Brokerage Services) and John Hogan, Group President (Brokerage Services), who are individuals that are expected to be included as "Named Executive Officers" in the Registrant's 2006 annual proxy statement (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers"), (ii) the performance criteria for the payment of cash bonuses for fiscal year 2007 to the Named Executive Officers, who are all participants in the Registrant's 2001 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (as the same may be amended, the "Incentive Plan"), (iii) the performance objectives for the issuance of shares of Performance-Based Restricted Stock ("PBRS") under the Incentive Plan and (iv) an Accelerated Revenue Program ("ARP") under the Incentive Plan and the performance objectives for the issuance of shares of restricted stock thereunder.
 
Fiscal Year 2007 Base Salaries
:
 
The following table sets forth the annual base salaries for fiscal year 2007 (
i.e.
, July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007) for the Named Executive Officers and for Christopher R. Reidy, who will become Chief Financial Officer no later than October 2, 2006:
 
 
Please note, however, that the base salaries for the Named Executive Officers will become effective in April of 2007 (rather than July 1, 2006). Consequently, the fiscal year 2007 base salary shown in the table above is a higher amount than the actual salary that will be earned from July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007 by each Named Executive Officer. The actual salary earned for fiscal year 2007 will be reflected in the Summary Compensation Table in the Registrant's 2007 annual proxy statement.
 
Fiscal Year 2007 Bonus Targets
:
 
The Named Executive Officers and Mr. Reidy participate in the Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2007. The Incentive Plan contains an annual bonus component designed to provide participating senior executive officers with incentive compensation based upon the achievement of pre-established performance objectives.
 
 
 
 
The approved performance criteria include earnings per share growth, revenue growth, achievement of a return on equity target, net operating income growth, achievement of sales targets, achievement of client retention targets, product creation and implementation objectives, the achievement of "Employer of Choice" objectives, and other corporate compliance, leadership and operational objectives. Each Named Executive Officer's primary areas of responsibility vary within the performance criteria and not every Named Executive Officer is allocated responsibility for each criteria. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee has determined the applicability and the weighting of the respective criteria for each Named Executive Officer.
 
Achievement of all of the performance objectives applicable to each Named Executive Officer and to Mr. Reidy could result in maximum bonuses under the Incentive Plan in the following amounts:
 
 
The bonus for each Named Executive Officer and Mr. Reidy is subject to downward (but not upward) discretionary adjustments, if any, as determined by the Compensation Committee, and is subject to and conditioned upon stockholder re-approval of the Incentive Plan at the Registrant's 2006 annual meeting. The Compensation Committee will determine whether the performance objectives were achieved after the end of the Registrant's fiscal year 2007, and any bonus payments earned will be made early in fiscal year 2008.
 
Fiscal Year 2007-2008 PBRS Targets
:
 
All Named Executive Officers and Mr. Reidy are eligible to receive PBRS awards under the Incentive Plan, subject to and conditioned upon stockholder re-approval of the Incentive Plan at the Registrant's 2006 annual meeting, based on the Registrant's earnings per share growth in fiscal years 2007-2008 measured against pre-set objectives. Any grants of restricted stock will occur early in fiscal year 2009 to Named Executive Officers and Mr. Reidy if they are employed by the Registrant at such time, with restrictions lapsing six months thereafter, assuming the Named Executive Officer's or Mr. Reidy's continued employment with the Registrant.
 
Achievement of the earnings per share growth objectives could result in maximum awards under the PBRS program of the following numbers of shares of restricted stock:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Accelerated Revenue Program
:
 
On August 10, 2006, the Compensation Committee approved the ARP. The ARP is designed to focus certain senior executives of the Registrant on accelerated revenue growth objectives. The ARP is a two-year program covering fiscal years 2007 and 2008, with revenue growth objectives set at the beginning of the program period. Payment of ARP awards, if any, will be made following the completion of the two-year period and will be made in shares of restricted stock to executives employed by the Registrant at the time of grant, with restrictions lapsing six months thereafter, assuming the executive's continued employment with the Registrant.
 
All Named Executive Officers and Mr. Reidy are eligible to receive awards under the ARP, subject to and conditioned upon stockholder re-approval of the Incentive Plan at the Registrant's 2006 annual meeting, based on the Registrant's revenue growth in fiscal years 2007-2008 measured against pre-set objectives. Target grants of restricted stock under the ARP will be determined based on a fixed percentage of each Named Executive Officer's July 1, 2006 base salary, or in Mr. Reidy's case, his base salary for fiscal year 2007. Achievement of all of the revenue growth objectives could result in maximum awards under the ARP of a number of shares of restricted stock reflecting the following percentages of base salary:
 
 
(b)
          
On August 10, 2006, Mr. Harvey M. Krueger, a director of the Registrant since 1967, retired from the Registrant's Board of Directors.

Such special meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.
 
Section 1.03.

. The Secretary or any Assistant Secretary shall cause written notice of the place, date and hour of each meeting of the stockholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called, to be given personally or by mail, not less than ten nor more than sixty days prior to the meeting, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given to a stockholder when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the record of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if he or she shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to him or her be mailed to some other address, then directed to him or her at such other address. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law.
 
No notice of any meeting of stockholders need be given to any stockholder who submits a signed waiver of notice, whether before or after the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in a written waiver of notice. The attendance of any stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
 
 
 
Section 1.04.

INDEMNIFICATION
 
Section 6.01.
Nature of Indemnity
. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, and may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to such an action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was or has agreed to become an employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he or she (
x
) acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, in the case of any such employee or agent, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be not in violation of any policies or directives of the Corporation, and (
y
) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; except that in the case of an action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (
i
) such indemnification shall be limited to expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in the defense or settlement of such action or suit, and (
ii
) no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
 
14
 
 
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. The indemnification under this Section 6.01 shall apply to all directors and officers of the Corporation who sit on the boards of directors of non-profit corporations in keeping with the Corporation's philosophy.
 
The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo
contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
Section 6.02.
Successful Defense
. To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.
 
Section 6.03.
Determination That Indemnification Is Proper
. Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under Section 6.01 of these By-Laws (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a determination is made that indemnification of the director or officer is not proper in the circumstances because he or she has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws. Any indemnification of an employee or agent of the Corporation under Section 6.01 of these By-Laws (unless ordered by a court) may be made by the Corporation upon a determination that indemnification of the employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws. Any such determination shall be made (
i
) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (
ii
) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (
iii
) by the stockholders.
 
Section 6.04.
Advance Payment of Expenses
. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. The Board of Directors may authorize the Corporation's counsel to represent such director, officer, employee or agent in any action, suit or proceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such action, suit or proceeding.
 
Section 6.05.
Procedure for Indemnification of Directors and Officers
. Any indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation under Sections 6.01 and 6.02 of these By-Laws, or advance of costs, charges and expenses to a director or officer under Section 6.04 of these By-Laws, shall be made promptly, and in any event within thirty days, upon the written
 
15
 
 
request of the director or officer. If a determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved such request. If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within thirty days, the right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 6.04 of these By-Laws where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by or tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 of these By-Laws, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
Section 6.06.
Survival; Preservation of Other Rights
. The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director, officer, employee and agent who serves in any such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law are in effect and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or any action, suit or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. Such a "contract right" may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such director, officer, employee or agent.
 
The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
Section 6.07.
Insurance
. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or
 
16
 
 
her against such liability under the provisions of this Article, provided that such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be made by a vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.
 
Section 6.08.
Severability
. If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director or officer and may indemnify each employee or agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
