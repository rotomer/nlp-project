Item 1.01.
 
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 25, 2008, Automatic Data Processing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into a $2.25 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "Facility") with a group of lenders. The Facility replaced the Company's $1.75 billion 364-day facility, which terminated on June 25, 2008. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acts as Administrative Agent and Bank of America, N.A. as Syndication Agent for the Facility. The existing $1.5 billion five-year facility entered into on June 29, 2005 and $2.25 billion five-year facility entered into on June 28, 2006 will continue in full force and effect.
 
Two borrowing options will be available under the Facility: (i) a competitive advance option and (ii) a revolving credit option. The competitive advance option will be provided on an uncommitted competitive advance basis through an auction mechanism. The revolving credit will be provided on a committed basis. Under each option amounts borrowed and repaid may be reborrowed subject to availability under the Facility.
 
The Lenders' commitments under the Facility will expire on June
24, 2009 and any borrowings outstanding will mature and be payable on such date (or, at the option of the Company, subject to the accuracy of all representations and warranties and the absence of any default, on June 24, 2010).
 
Interest under a competitive advance option will be payable at the rates obtained from bids selected by the Company in accordance with standard competitive auction procedures of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.. At the Company's option, revolving loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) .12% plus a LIBOR-based rate for a one, two, three or six month interest period as selected by the Company, or (ii) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (a) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate and (b) the federal funds effective rate plus .50%.  Interest rates with respect to revolving borrowings will increase by .125% per annum if the commitments are extended for an additional year. In addition, the Company will pay a fee on the revolving credit line at a rate of .03% per annum.
 
The Facility has terms that are substantially similar to the terms of the facility it replaced, including customary covenants that restrict the Company's and its borrowing subsidiaries' ability to create liens or other encumbrances, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations, mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of their respective assets.  The Facility contains customary events of default which would permit the lenders to accelerate the loans, including the failure to make timely payments or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.
 
The Company has agreed to guarantee any obligations of any of its subsidiaries that are entitled to borrow the funds under the Facility.  Borrowings under the Facility may be used for general corporate purposes.
 
 
The Facility is led by JPMorgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, as Co-Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners. Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas, Citicorp USA, Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Wachovia Bank, National Association are Documentation Agents.
 
Certain of the lenders under the Facility, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform for the Company and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.14 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent has made an amount corresponding to such share available to such Borrower, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan.

that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.10(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.10(c). Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
 
 
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13 and (ii) break funding payments pursuant to Section 2.16.
SECTION 2.12.
Fees.
(a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, in US Dollars, for the account of each Lender, a facility fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.03% per annum on the daily amount of the sum of such Lender's Commitment (whether used or unused) during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates;
provided
that, if such Lender continues to have any Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Exposure to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any such Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and on the date on which all the Commitments shall have terminated and the Lenders shall have no further Exposures. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
(b) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
(c) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in the case of facility fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
SECTION 2.13.
Interest.
(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (i) prior to the Termination Date, at the Alternate Base Rate and (ii) on and after the Termination Date, at the Alternate Base Rate plus 0.125% per annum.
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest (i) in the case of a Revolving Borrowing, at the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus (A) prior to the Termination Date, 0.12% per annum and (B) on and after the Termination Date, 0.245% per annum, or (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan, at the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus (or minus, as applicable) the Margin applicable to such Loan.
(c) Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan.
 
 
(d) Each Contract Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum agreed upon between the applicable Borrower and Lender.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% per annum plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section and (ii) in the case of any other amount payable, 2% per annum plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) above.
(f) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (f) above shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(g) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
SECTION 2.14.
Alternate Rate of Interest.
If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by a majority in interest of the Lenders that would participate in such Borrowing that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and the applicable Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
 
 
until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the applicable Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and any Eurocurrency Borrowing that is requested to be continued shall be repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, and (ii) any Borrowing Request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective.
SECTION 2.15.
Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law or the applicability of any Statutory Reserves shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; or
(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or participations therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay or cause the other Borrowers to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay or cause the other Borrowers to pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) Each Lender shall determine the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section using the methods customarily used by it for such purpose (and if such Lender uses more than one such method, the method used hereunder shall be that which most accurately determines such amount or amounts). A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
 
 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such amount, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay or cause the other Borrowers to pay to such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 Business Days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and delivers a certificate with respect thereto as provided in paragraph (c) above;
provided
further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
SECTION 2.16.
Break Funding Payments.
In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan to a Loan of a different Type or Interest Period other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(d) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment or deemed assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 15 Business Days after receipt thereof.
 
 
SECTION 2.17.
Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any Borrower in respect of any Obligation hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided
that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 15 Business Days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances giving rise thereto and the calculations used by such Lender to determine the amount thereof delivered to the Company by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate;
provided
 
 
that such Lender has received written notice from the Company advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and containing all applicable documentation.
SECTION 2.18.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs.
(a) Except as agreed by the relevant Borrower and the applicable Lenders with respect to Contract Loans, each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time (or any other applicable time agreed by the relevant Borrower and the applicable Lenders with respect to Contract Loans) on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account specified in Schedule 2.18 for the account of the applicable Lenders or, in any such case, to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall from time to time specify in a notice delivered to the Company and the applicable Borrower;
provided
that payments to the applicable Lenders in respect of Contract Loans and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein (it being agreed that the Borrowers will be deemed to have satisfied their obligations with respect to payments referred to in this proviso if they shall make such payments to the persons entitled thereto in accordance with instructions provided by the Administrative Agent; the Administrative Agent agrees to provide such instructions upon request, and no Borrower will be deemed to have failed to make such a payment if it shall transfer such payment to an improper account or address as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to provide proper instructions). The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any Lender or other Person promptly, in accordance with customary banking practices, following receipt thereof at the appropriate lending office or other address specified by such Lender or other Person. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
(b) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any
 
 
other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of their Loans and accrued interest thereon;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Any purchaser of a participation under this paragraph shall have the benefit of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 with respect to the participation purchased, but shall not be deemed by virtue of such purchase to have extended any Commitment that it had not extended prior to such purchase.
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due for the account of all or certain of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders , as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry practices on interbank compensation.
(d) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by it for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations to the Administrative Agent until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.19.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account
 
 
of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall consult with the Company regarding any actions that could be taken to reduce amounts payable under such Sections and the costs of taking such actions and shall, at the request of the Company following such consultations, use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld and (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee or the Company. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20.
Designation of Borrowing Subsidiaries.
The Company may at any time and from time to time designate any Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company, and upon such delivery such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Borrowing Subsidiary at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to such Borrowing Subsidiary shall be outstanding hereunder,
provided
that such Borrowing Subsidiary Termination shall be effective to terminate the right of such Borrowing Subsidiary to make further Borrowings
 
 
under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.

The Administrative Agent
In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Person named in the heading of this Agreement is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders and each assignee of any Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or assignee and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, and by the Borrowers with respect to clause (c) below, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Company of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials
 
 
delivered by the Company or any other Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents as received by the Administrative Agent.
With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries or other Affiliates thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise upon receipt of notice in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any of the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the institution serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by a Borrower (in which case the Administrative Agent shall give written notice to each other Lender), and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement,
 
 
instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse the Administrative Agent, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata share (based on the amount of its Loans and available Commitments hereunder) of any expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by the Administrative Agent, including counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, that shall not have been reimbursed by the Company or any other Borrower and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and any of its Related Parties, on demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of
 
 
any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as Administrative Agent or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or action taken or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Company or any other Borrower;
provided
that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent or any such other indemnified Person for any portion of such liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent, and any of its Related Parties or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
None of the Lenders identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement or elsewhere herein as a "co-syndication agent" or "documentation agent" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such.
ARTICLE IX
 
Guarantee
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the other Borrowers hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of such other Borrowers. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or
 
 
modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.

SECTION 10.02.
Waivers; Amendments.
(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase any Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender adversely affected thereby, (iii) postpone the date of any scheduled payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby (provided that nothing shall limit the right of each Borrower to extend the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.08(f) without the consent of any Lender), (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that the addition of new tranches of loans or commitments that may be extended under this Agreement shall not be deemed to alter such pro rata sharing of payments), (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (except, in each case, to provide for new tranches of loans or commitments that may be extended under this Agreement) or (vi) release the Company from, or limit or condition, its obligations under Article IX, without the written consent of each Lender;
provided
further
that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

(a) The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and such Affiliates, in connection with the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
 
 
for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights under any Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.
(b) The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, liabilities, out-of-pocket costs or expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee (whether by a third party or by any Borrower) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) any transaction or proposed transaction (whether or not consummated) in which any proceeds of any Borrowing hereunder are applied or proposed to be applied, directly or indirectly, by any of the Borrowers or their Subsidiaries, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom or (iii) the execution, delivery or performance by any of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries of the Loan Documents, or any actions or omissions of a Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection therewith;
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, liabilities, costs or expenses shall have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
(c) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided
that the unreimbursed loss, liability, cost or expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum (without duplication) of the total Exposures and unused Commitments at the time.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Borrower shall assert, and each Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable within 15 Business Days after receipt by the Company of a reasonably detailed invoice therefor.
SECTION 10.04.
Successors and Assigns.
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the Company nor any Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
 
 
without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans or other amounts at the time owing to it);
provided
that (i)  the Administrative Agent (except in the case of an assignment to a Lender) and the Company (except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or a Related Fund of a Lender or if an Event of Default has occurred and has been continuing for 30 days) must each give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or a Related Fund of any Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitments and outstanding Loans, the US Dollar Equivalent of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than US$10,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of US$3,500 and (iv) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that any consent of the Company otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default referred to in clause (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
 
 
(c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of each Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been made in compliance with this Agreement as provided in this paragraph.
(e) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive
 
 
with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant so provides and is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.
(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or, in the case of a Lender that is an investment fund, to the trustee under the indenture to which such fund is a party, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
SECTION 10.05.
Survival.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrowers herein or in any other Loan Document or in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto or thereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any other Loan Document and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 10.03 and 10.12 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.
SECTION 10.06.
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
 
 
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or email transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
SECTION 10.07.
Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 10.08.
Right of Setoff.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final and in whatever currency denominated) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
SECTION 10.09.
Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
(b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
 
 
(c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
SECTION 10.10.
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
SECTION 10.11.
Headings.
Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
SECTION 10.12.
Confidentiality.
(a) The Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors, to Related Funds' directors and officers and to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements (it being understood that each Person to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) to the extent required or advisable in the judgment of counsel in connection with any suit, action or proceeding
 
 
relating to the enforcement of rights of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders against the Borrowers under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (B) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (vii) with the consent of the Company or (viii) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section of which the Administrative Agent or Lender is aware or (B) becomes available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company other than as a result of a breach of this Section of which the Administrative Agent or Lender is aware. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Company relating to the Company or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company other than as a result of a breach of this Section of which the Administrative Agent or Lender is aware. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
(b) Each Lender acknowledges that Information furnished to it pursuant to this Agreement may include material non-public information concerning the Company and its Related Parties or the Company's securities, and confirms that it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and that it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with those procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws.
(c) All information, including requests for waivers and amendments, furnished by the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Administrative Agent pursuant to, or in the course of administering, this Agreement will be syndicate-level information, which may contain material non-public information about the Company, the Subsidiaries and their Related Parties or the Company's securities. Accordingly, each Lender represents to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it has identified in its Administrative Questionnaire a credit contact who may receive information that may contain material non-public information in accordance with its compliance procedures and applicable law, including Federal and state securities laws.
SECTION 10.13.
Conversion of Currencies.
(a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be
 
 
purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
(b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "
Applicable Creditor
") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "
Judgment Currency
") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the "
Agreement Currency
"), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 10.13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.
SECTION 10.14.
Interest Rate Limitation.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "
Charges
"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "
Maximum Rate
") which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall have been received by such Lender.
SECTION 10.15.
USA Patriot Act
. Each Lender hereby notifies each Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "
Patriot Act
"), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies such Borrower, which information includes the name and address of such Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act. Each Borrower agrees to provide the Lenders, upon request, with all documentation and other information required to be obtained by the Lenders pursuant to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act.
SECTION 10.16.
No Fiduciary Relationship.
Each Borrower, on behalf of itself and the Subsidiaries, agrees that in connection with all aspects of the transactions
 
 
contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith, each Borrower, the Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or their Affiliates, and no such duty will be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or communications.

[FORM OF]
OPINION OF JAMES B. BENSON, ESQ.,
GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE COMPANY
[Effective Date]
To the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent Referred to Below
c/o JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent
270 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10017
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am General Counsel of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (the "Company"), and have acted as counsel for the Company in connection with the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of June 25, 2008 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the Borrowing Subsidiaries from time to time party thereto (the Company and the Borrowing Subsidiaries being collectively called the "Borrowers"), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
In that connection, I have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records and other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this opinion, including (i) the Credit Agreement, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and each other Borrower, (iii) the By-laws of the Company and each other Borrower and (iv) resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company and each other Borrower. I have also relied, with respect to certain factual matters, on the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Credit Agreement and have assumed compliance by the Borrowers with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by all parties thereto other than the Borrowers.
Based on the foregoing, I am of opinion as follows:
1. Each Borrower (a) is duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has all requisite power
 
 
and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, (c) is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, other than jurisdictions in which the failure so to qualify could not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect and (d) has the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to borrow under the Credit Agreement.
2. The execution, delivery and performance of each of the Loan Documents by each Borrower party thereto and the borrowings thereunder (collectively, the "Transactions") (a) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action and (b) will not conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under (i) any provision of the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of any Borrower, (ii) any applicable law, rule or regulation of the United States of America or the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including, without limitation, Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States) or, to my knowledge, any order or decree of any court or government agency or instrumentality, or (iii) the provisions of any material agreement or material instrument to which any Borrower is a party or by which any of them or any of their property is or may be bound.
3. The Credit Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Borrower party thereto and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each such Borrower, in each case enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditor's rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity (including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing), regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
4. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to, consent of, order of or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the Borrowers of the Credit Agreement, except as may be required under applicable securities laws and regulations.
5. To my knowledge, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency or authority or arbitrator involving any Borrower or the business, assets or rights of any Borrower (i) that purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or the Transactions or (ii) as to which there is a probability of an adverse determination, and which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or on the ability of any Borrower to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement.
6. No Borrower is an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940.
 
 
 
I express no opinion herein as to (i) Section 10.09(b) of the Credit Agreement insofar as such Section relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (ii) the waiver of an inconvenient forum set forth in Section 10.09(c) of the Credit Agreement or (iii) Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement insofar as it relates to set-offs in respect of participations purchased in Loans.
I am admitted to practice in the State of New York and I express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Federal Law of the United States of America.
This opinion is rendered only to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their permitted transferees under the Credit Agreement and is solely for their benefit in connection with the above transactions. This opinion may not be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,
