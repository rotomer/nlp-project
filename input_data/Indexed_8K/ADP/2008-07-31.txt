ADP Reports Fiscal 2008 Results; Provides Fiscal 2009 Guidance
Revenues Rise 12.5%; EPS from Continuing Operations Increases 21% Excluding Current and Prior Fiscal Year Gains
Forecasting Fiscal 2009 Revenue Growth of 7% to 8% and EPS Growth of 10% to 14%
ROSELAND, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP):
Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NYSE:ADP) reported 12.5% revenue growth to $8.78 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, Gary C. Butler, president and chief executive officer, announced today. Revenue growth benefited 2% from favorable foreign exchange rates during the year. Excluding the current and prior year gains noted above, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 21% from $1.80 to $2.18.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2008 Discussion
Commenting on the results, Mr. Butler said, ADPs results for the year were strong. We continue to execute against our strategic growth program and have also continued to return a high level of excess cash to our shareholders. While certain of our key business metrics, such as the number of employees on our clients payrolls, were impacted by the softening of the economy during the second half of the fiscal year, they remain positive. Importantly, new business sales in both Employer Services and Dealer Services continued to grow despite the challenging economy. We continued to invest in new products, salesforce expansion, and implementation and client service resources.
Employer Services
Employer Services revenues increased 7% for the fourth quarter, all organic, and over 9% for the year, 8% organic. In the United States, revenues from our traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business grew 4% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Beyond payroll revenues, excluding PEO Services revenues, grew 12% for the fourth quarter and 16% for the year. The increase in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls slowed in the United States to 0.8% for the fourth quarter and 1.3% for the year, as measured on a same-store-sales basis for our clients on our Auto Pay platform. Pay growth in Europe continued in the fourth quarter and was positive for the full year compared with a year ago. Worldwide client retention improved 20 basis points for the year to a new record level. Employer Services pretax margin improved nearly 150 basis points and 90 basis points for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The full-year pretax margin expansion resulted from continued operating leverage, including benefits from margin expansion initiatives, which more than offset the impact of our product investments that drive our five-point strategic growth program.
Despite challenges that continue to exist in the selling environment, I am pleased with our execution for the fourth quarter. Combined Employer Services and PEO Services worldwide new business sales grew 7% for the quarter and 8% for the year. New business sales represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from new orders.
PEO Services
PEO Services revenues increased 16.5% for the fourth quarter and 20% for the year, all organic. PEO Services pretax margin improved approximately 30 basis points for the fourth quarter and 80 basis points for the year. Average worksite employees paid by PEO Services increased 17% for the fourth quarter, and 18% for the year, to approximately 187,000 and 176,000, respectively.
Dealer Services
Dealer Services revenues increased 9% for the fourth quarter and 8.5% for the year, with 6% organic for both the fourth quarter and full year. I am pleased that, despite market conditions, Dealer Services had a solid fourth quarter, including very strong sales growth both domestically and internationally. New business sales growth was strong for the year, with double-digit growth in both our North American and International businesses. Dealer Services pretax margin expanded over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter and 75 basis points for the year. The quarter and full-year pretax margin expansion resulted from increased operating leverage, partially offset by costs relating to the acquisitions of three Autoline distributors that were completed earlier in the year.
Interest on Funds Held for Clients, Interest Income on Corporate Funds, and Interest Expense
"Our investment portfolio strategy is to ladder and extend maturities relating to our client funds. On days when inflows of cash from clients and maturing investments are not enough to satisfy the days obligations we may choose to employ short-term financing to satisfy client funds obligations. This extended investment strategy allows us to temper the effects of interest rate fluctuations and average our way through an interest rate cycle. Additionally, this strategy impacts interest on funds held for clients, interest income on corporate funds, and interest expense.
For the fourth quarter, interest on funds held for clients declined $8.4 million, or 4.7%, from $178.1 million to $169.7 million, due to a decline of nearly 40 basis points in the average interest yield to 4.2%, partially offset by growth of 4.2% in average client funds balances to $16.1 billion. Interest income on corporate funds declined $9.2 million, or 20%, from $46.6 million to $37.4 million due to a lower average interest yield of 100 basis points to 4.0%, as well as lower average corporate investment balances compared with last years fourth quarter which included the cash dividend from the spin-off of Brokerage Services. Included in interest income on corporate funds is interest income related to the extended investment strategy which increased $6.4 million, or 42% from $15.1 to $21.5 million. Interest expense declined $7.6 million, or 38%, from $20.1 million to $12.4 million primarily from interest expense on our short-term financing related to the extended investment strategy where the benefit of a 300 basis point decline in average borrowing rates to 2.2% was partially offset by higher average daily borrowings.
For the fiscal year, interest on funds held for clients grew $30.9 million, or 4.7%, from $653.6 million to $684.5 million, due to growth of 6.6% in average client funds balances to $15.7 billion, partially offset by a decline of nearly 10 basis points in the average interest yield to 4.4%. Interest income on corporate funds declined $15.5 million, or 9%, from $165.0 million to $149.5 million due to a lower average interest yield of 20 basis points to 4.4%, as well as lower average corporate investment balances. Included in interest income on corporate funds is interest income related to the extended investment strategy which increased $9.2 million, or 13%, from $70.1 million to $79.4 million. Interest expense declined $14.4 million, or 15%, from $94.9 million to $80.5 million primarily from interest expense on our short-term financing related to the extended investment strategy where the benefit of a 120 basis point decline in average borrowing rates to 4.1% was partially offset by higher daily average borrowings.
Fiscal 2009 Forecast
For fiscal 2009, we are assuming no change in the current economic environment. As a result, we are forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8%, and diluted earning per share growth of 10% to 14%, up from $2.18 per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2008 excluding the gain on the sale of a building in the fourth fiscal quarter.
We anticipate revenue growth of 6% to 7% for Employer Services, 16% to 17% for PEO Services, and 6% to 8% for Dealer Services. We anticipate at least 50 basis points of pretax margin expansion in each business segment. We are planning mid single-digit new business sales growth worldwide for Employer Services and PEO Services on a combined basis. We anticipate tougher year-over-year comparisons in new business sales growth during the first half of fiscal 2009 as the lower growth rates in the second half of fiscal 2008 are expected to continue as a result of the weakened economic environment.
The interest assumptions in our forecasts are based on Fed Funds futures contracts and forward yield curves as of July 28, 2008. The Fed Funds futures contracts anticipate three increases of 25 basis points each when the Fed is scheduled to meet in October 2008, and in January and May 2009, exiting the fiscal year with a Fed funds rate of 2.75%. The forward yield curves indicate fixed income rates increasing 40 to 50 basis points during the fiscal year.
Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decline $25 to $30 million, or approximately 4%, from $684.5 million in fiscal 2008 to $655 to $660 million based on an approximate 20 basis point decline in the average interest yield to nearly 4.2%, partially offset by 1% to 2% anticipated growth in average client funds balances to $15.8 to $15.9 billion.
Interest income on corporate funds is expected to be relatively flat compared to $149.5 million in fiscal 2008. Included in interest income on corporate funds is interest income related to the extended investment strategy which is expected to increase $5 to $10 million from $79.4 million to $85 to $90 million.
Interest expense is expected to decline $25 to $30 million from $80.5 million in fiscal 2008 to $50 to $55 million from lower short-term interest expense related to the extended investment strategy due to an anticipated decline of 170 basis points in average borrowing rates to 2.4%, partially offset by higher anticipated average daily borrowings.
This forecast is reflective of the current, challenging economic environment. We believe that fiscal 2009 will be a very solid year and ADPs long-term growth outlook remains positive. We are continuing to invest in ADPs future as we execute successfully against our five-point strategic growth program. We have returned to our shareholders almost $1.5 billion through share repurchases and $549 million in dividends during fiscal 2008, and we remain committed to continuing to return excess cash to our shareholders, Mr. Butler concluded.
