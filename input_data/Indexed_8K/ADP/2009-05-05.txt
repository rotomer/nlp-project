EXHIBIT 99
ROSELAND, N.J., May 5, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (Nasdaq:ADP) reported a 2% revenue decline to $2.37 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2009, Gary C. Butler, president and chief executive officer, announced today. Revenue was negatively impacted by the severe economic conditions and over 3 percentage points of unfavorable foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Pretax earnings from continuing operations declined 1% and net earnings from continuing operations were essentially flat. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $0.80 from $0.77 a year ago on fewer shares outstanding. Fiscal year-to-date, ADP acquired 13.8 million shares of its stock for treasury at a cost of about $550 million. Cash and marketable securities at March 31, 2009 were $1.47 billion.
Commenting on the results, Mr. Butler said, "ADP's third quarter results were negatively impacted by the recessionary economic environment and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The selling environment continued to be soft in Employer Services and PEO Services across all market segments. As anticipated, our same-store-sales employment metric was also negative for the quarter which is indicative of the steep rise in U.S. unemployment. Dealer Services' results reflect the continued difficult state of the automotive market. Notwithstanding these challenges, ADP continues to control expenses and appropriately align our expense base with our revenue growth.
Employer Services
"Employer Services' revenues increased 1% in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. As previously disclosed, we anticipated slower revenue growth for Employer Services during the second half of fiscal 2009 due to the negative impact of the weak economy on sales, retention and employment levels. In line with our expectations, revenues in the United States from our payroll and payroll tax filing business declined 3% and beyond payroll revenues grew 6% in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. Worldwide client retention, while still at historically high levels, declined 1.0 percentage point fiscal year to date through March 31, 2009. The number of employees on our clients' payrolls in the U.S. decreased 4.2% in the third quarter as measured on a same-store-sales basis for clients on our AutoPay platform. The dollar value of new business sold worldwide during the quarter in Employer Services and PEO Services was 10% less than the prior year's third quarter. The dollar valu e of new business sold during the quarter represents the expected new annual recurring revenue dollars to be generated from each sale. Employer Services' pretax margin expanded 70 basis points from continued expense control and lower selling expenses from lower new business sales, partially offset by investments in client service resources.
PEO Services
"PEO Services' revenues increased 10% and pretax margin improved 80 basis points in the third quarter compared with the same period last year. Average worksite employees paid by PEO Services increased 14,000, or 8%, to over 195,000, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
Dealer Services
"Dealer Services' revenues declined 3% in the third quarter, while pretax margin expanded 20 basis points assisted by expense control initiatives, compared with the same period last year. The number of North American auto dealerships continued to decline from consolidations and closings. Despite the decline in the number of dealerships, ADP improved its market share compared with a year ago in both the North American and International marketplaces due to successful competitive win rates as well as increased deployment of our Autoline solution.
Interest on Funds Held for Clients and Interest Expense
"The safety and liquidity of our clients' funds are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. Client funds are invested in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines and the credit quality of the investment portfolio is predominantly AAA/AA.
"For the third fiscal quarter, interest on funds held for clients declined $34.2 million, or 17.2%, to $164.3 million due to a decline of 50 basis points in the average interest yield to 3.7%, and a decline of 6.2% in average client funds balances to $17.6 billion.
"Interest expense for the third quarter declined $5.4 million, or 68.6%, to $2.5 million compared with the same period last year. The decline in interest expense was primarily the result of a 340 basis point decline in our average commercial paper borrowing rate to 0.2%, partially offset by higher average daily commercial paper borrowings which increased $0.6 billion, to $1.1 billion. We utilize our short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations in order to extend the maturities of our investment portfolio, thus averaging our way through an interest rate cycle.
Fiscal 2009 forecast
"We continue to anticipate achieving 1% to 2% revenue growth, and the low end of our 10% to 14% growth forecast in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, up from $2.18 in fiscal 2008 which excludes the net one-time gain of $0.02 per share recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Our revenue growth forecast for the year is negatively impacted approximately two percentage points due to our assumption of unfavorable foreign exchange rates continuing for the remainder of the fiscal year.
"Our business segment forecasts are also unchanged. For Employer Services, we continue to anticipate revenue growth of about 4% and about 100 basis points of pretax margin expansion. We continue to anticipate 12% to 13% revenue growth for PEO Services, and up to 30 basis points of pretax margin expansion. Despite the difficult selling environment, we are still on track to deliver over $1 billion worldwide in new business sales for Employer Services and PEO Services on a combined basis, which represents a decline of up to 13% from about $1.15 billion in new business sales last fiscal year. For Dealer Services, we continue to anticipate a 2% to 3% decline in revenues, and a flat pretax margin compared with a year ago.
"There is no change to our interest on funds held for clients forecast. We continue to anticipate a decline of $75 to $80 million, or 11% to 12%, from $684.5 million in fiscal 2008. This is based on an approximate 40 basis point decline in the expected average interest yield to about 4.0%, and a 2% to 3% decline in average client funds balances. This forecast continues to include an unfavorable Canadian foreign exchange rate which is expected to negatively impact full-year average client funds balance growth by 1.5 percentage points. The interest assumptions in our client funds portfolio forecast assume overnight funds will yield nearly 0.4% on average for the remainder of the fiscal year. The three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency rates based on the forward yield curves as of May 1, 2009 were used to forecast new purchase rates for the client extended and client long portfolios, respectively.
"We continue to expect interest expense to decline about $50 million from $80.5 million in fiscal 2008 primarily from lower interest expense on our short-term financing related to our client funds extended investment strategy. Our average commercial paper borrowing rates are expected to decline approximately 320 basis points to about 1.0%, partially offset by an expected increase of about $0.5 billion in average daily commercial paper borrowings to about $2.0 billion.
"Our results, though lower than historical ADP standards, are due to our focused execution against our 5-point strategic growth program, as well as the strength of ADP's business model. While in the midst of one of the most challenging global economies of recent decades, I remain confident in ADP's opportunities for longer-term growth. I am especially proud of ADP's AAA credit rating. The breadth of our product portfolio has never been stronger. We are doing the right things to position ADP to leverage an economic recovery," Mr. Butler concluded.
