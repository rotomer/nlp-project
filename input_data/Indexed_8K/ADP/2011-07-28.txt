EXHIBIT 99.1
ROSELAND, N.J., July 28, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (Nasdaq:ADP) reported revenue growth of 11%, 6% organic, to $9.9 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, Gary C. Butler, chief executive officer, announced today. Pretax earnings from continuing operations increased 4%, net earnings from continuing operations increased 4%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.52 increased 5% from $2.40 a year ago on fewer shares outstanding. Fiscal 2010 included a favorable tax item which reduced the provision for income taxes by $12.2 million. Excluding the favorable tax item from fiscal 2010, net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6% from $2.37 per share a year ago. 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, revenues increased 14%, 9% organic, to $2.5 billion compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Pretax earnings from continuing operations increased 17%, net earnings from continuing operations increased 16%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48 increased 14%, from $0.42 per share a year ago. Revenue and earnings growth benefited 2 percentage points from favorable foreign exchange rates compared with a year ago. 
ADP acquired 10.4 million shares of its stock for treasury at a cost of nearly $560 million during the fourth quarter, and about 14.2 million shares at a cost of about $730 million during the fiscal year. Cash and marketable securities were $1.5 billion at June 30, 2011.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Discussion
Commenting on the results, Mr. Butler said, "ADP achieved very good results for fiscal 2011. Our key business metrics continued to trend positively and were the strongest they have been in three years. As anticipated, new business sales growth for Employer Services and PEO Services was solid in the fourth quarter, and we attained our sales target for the year of nearly $1.1 billion in expected, annualized recurring revenues. Employer Services' client revenue retention also improved for the fourth quarter from a year ago, resulting in a record high retention level of just over 91% for the year. The automotive marketplace continued to steadily recover and Dealer Services posted very strong new business sales exiting the year.
"I am delighted with the level of acquisition activity during fiscal 2011 as this is an important part of ADP's capital allocation strategy. We closed multiple acquisitions with about $450 million in annualized revenues that are expected to enhance future organic revenues. The strength of ADP's fiscal 2011 operating cash flows allowed us to return excess cash of $1.4 billion to our shareholders through continued dividends and share buybacks while investing about $775 million in acquisitions.
Employer Services
"Employer Services' revenues grew 9% for the fourth quarter, 6% organically. Revenues grew 8% for the year, 5% organically. In the United States, revenues from our traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business grew 4% for the fourth quarter, and 3% for the year.  Beyond payroll revenues grew 13% for both the fourth quarter and for the year, with 3 points of the growth from acquisitions. The number of employees on our clients' payrolls in the United States increased 2.6% for the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the year, as measured on a same-store-sales basis for our clients on our Auto Pay platform. Worldwide client retention improved 0.4 and 1.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Good organic revenue growth and easier comparisons from last year's increased investments in sales and service headcount resulted in pretax margin expansion. Employer Services' pretax margin improved 60 basis points for the quarter, which included a drag of about 150 basis points from acquisition activity. For the full year, the negative impact from acquisition activity of about 80 basis points resulted in a decline in pretax margin of 30 basis points.
"Combined Employer Services and PEO Services worldwide new business sales increased 8% for the quarter and 9% for the year.  New business sales represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from new orders.
PEO Services
"PEO Services' revenues increased 20% for the fourth quarter and 17% for the year, all organic.  PEO Services' pretax margin improved 10 basis points for the fourth quarter, but declined 80 basis points for the year primarily due to the grow-over impact of last year's $9 million favorable state unemployment tax settlement. Average worksite employees paid by PEO Services increased 14% for the fourth quarter, and 12% for the year, to approximately 239,000 and 227,000, respectively.
Dealer Services
"Dealer Services' revenues grew 30% for the fourth quarter, 4% organically. Revenues grew 24% for the year, 3% organically.  Total revenues for the fourth quarter and full year benefited primarily from the Cobalt acquisition closed in the first quarter. Dealer Services' pretax margin improved 20 basis points for the fourth quarter and declined 100 basis points for the year due to the negative impact on both the fourth quarter and full year from acquisition activity of about 200 basis points.  
Interest on Funds Held for Clients
"The safety, liquidity, and diversification of our clients' funds are the foremost objectives of our investment strategy. Client funds are invested in accordance with ADP's prudent and conservative investment guidelines and the credit quality of the investment portfolio is predominantly AAA/AA.
"For the fourth quarter, interest on funds held for clients declined $3.6 million, or 2.6%, from $139.3 million to $135.7 million, due to a decline of nearly 50 basis points in the average interest yield to 2.9%, partially offset by an increase of 13% in average client funds balances from $16.3 billion to $18.5 billion. 
"For the fiscal year, interest on funds held for clients declined $2.7 million from $542.8 million to $540.1 million, due to a decline of nearly 40 basis points in the average interest yield to 3.2%, partially offset by an increase of 11% in average client funds balances from $15.2 billion to $16.9 billion. 
Fiscal 2012 Forecast
"Our fiscal 2012 forecasts anticipate no changes in the current economic environment and are as follows: 
Total revenues  increase 7% to 9%
Diluted earnings per share  increase 8% to 10%, compared with $2.52 earnings per share in fiscal 2011
Employer Services  revenue growth of 6% to 7%; pretax margin expansion of at least 50 basis points
Pays per control  up 1% to 2% for the year
PEO Services  revenue growth of 15% to 17%; pretax margin about flat
Employer Services and PEO Services new business sales  8% to 10% growth compared to $1.1 billion sold in fiscal 2011
Dealer Services  revenue growth of 8% to 9%; pretax margin expansion of about 50 basis points. About 2 points of revenue growth is anticipated to result from the full-year effect of the Cobalt acquisition, which was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.
"Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decline $25 to $35 million, or 5% to 6%, from $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. This is based on a decline of 30 to 40 basis points in the expected average interest yield to 2.8% to 2.9%, and 7% to 8% growth in average client funds balances.  The interest assumptions in our forecasts are based on Fed Funds futures contracts and forward yield curves as of July 26, 2011. The Fed Funds futures contracts do not anticipate any changes during the fiscal year in the Fed Funds target rate. The three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency rates based on the forward yield curves as of July 26, 2011 were used to forecast new purchase rates for the client extended and client long portfolios, respectively.  
"I am pleased with the strength and resiliency of ADP's business model as evidenced by very good results during fiscal 2011.  Solid sales performance and the positive trends in our key business metrics drove organic revenue growth upward during the year. Our investment in product innovation continues to drive ADP's strong market leading position. We will continue to invest in ADP's future and focus on successful execution against our 5-point strategic growth program. I remain optimistic about ADP's growth opportunities," Mr. Butler concluded.
