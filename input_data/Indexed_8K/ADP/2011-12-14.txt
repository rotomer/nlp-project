Any removal of the term President from your title after the date hereof shall not be deemed to be any way a diminution of your position, duties, responsibilities or authority.
b.           You shall devote your full business time, energy and skill, on an exclusive basis, to the business and affairs of ADP and will use your business time, energy and skill to promote the business and interests of ADP and any and all of the ADP divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may serve upon the board of directors (or its equivalent) of other public or private organizations, with the prior approval of the Board.

As a condition of your employment, you agree to abide by and be bound by the terms, conditions and provisions of the restrictive covenants set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto, which terms, conditions and provisions are incorporated by reference into this letter agreement.

c.           If your death occurs while you are actively employed by ADP, ADPs obligation to make payments to you (beyond previously accrued and unpaid amounts) shall cease on the date of your death.
d.           If you elect to resign from ADP, ADPs obligation to make payments to you (beyond previously accrued and unpaid amounts) shall cease on the date your employment ends.
e.           If during your employment with ADP, ADP terminates your employment for any reason other than for cause as described in paragraph 4(a) or for a disability as set forth in paragraph 4(b) or upon your death as set forth in paragraph 4(c) or you elect to resign as set forth in paragraph 4(d), and you execute and do not revoke a Release, you will be paid an amount (in addition to any previously accrued but unpaid amounts) equal to 2.6 times your annual salary for the fiscal year of termination, payable in monthly installments over 12 months.   You will separately receive the bonus for the fiscal year of termination that you would have otherwise have received if your employment had not been terminated, based upon your (and to the extent applicable, ADPs) actual full-year performance (as determined by the Compensation Committee), prorated to reflect the portion of the fiscal year worked through the date of termination. Further, such amount will be paid in the following fiscal year at the same time that bonuses would have otherwise been paid in the ordinary course, absent termination of employment.
f.           You will continue to participate in the Change in Control Severance Plan for Corporate Officers (the CIC Plan). In the event of a change in control of ADP and a subsequent qualifying termination occurs (as such terms are defined in the CIC Plan), you will be entitled to the greater of the benefits and payments under the CIC Plan and this letter agreement.  Further, for the purposes of the application of the severance benefit described in Section 1.1 of the CIC Plan, you will be entitled to an amount equal to 200% of current total annual compensation (as defined in the CIC plan) under the circumstances of clause 1.1(a)(i) thereof and 150% of current total annual compensation under the circumstances of clause 1.1(a)(ii) thereof.

        (a)        For purposes of this letter agreement,  means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and such other Treasury or Internal Revenue Service guidance) as in effect from time to time.   The parties intend that any amounts payable hereunder that are not otherwise exempt from the provisions of Section 409A (including pursuant to the short term deferral exception) and which could constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A will be compliant with Section 409A.
Section 409A
Code
        (b)        Notwithstanding anything in this letter agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent required by Section 409A, in the event you are deemed to be a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and you are not disabled within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(C), no payments hereunder that are deferred

compensation subject to Section 409A , and that are due or payable on account of separation from service (as defined in Section 409A), shall be made to you prior to the date that is six (6) months after the date of your separation from service  or, if earlier, your date of death.  Following any applicable six (6) month delay, all such delayed payments will be paid in a single lump sum on the earliest date permitted under Section 409A that is also a business day.  
        (c)        For purposes of this letter agreement, with respect to payments of any amounts that are considered to be deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, references to termination of employment (and substantially similar phrases) shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, and each of the payments that may be made hereunder are designated as separate payments. Any payment or benefit due upon a termination of your employment under paragraph 4.e that represents a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall commence to be paid or provided to you 61 days following a separation from service, provided that you execute a Release within 60 days following your separation from service.
        (d)         Any payment or benefit under this letter agreement or otherwise that is eligible for exemption from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(A) or (C) (relating to certain reimbursements and in-kind benefits) shall be paid or provided to you only to the extent that the expenses are not incurred, or the benefits are not provided, beyond the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which your separation from service occurs; and provided further that such expenses are reimbursed no later than the last day of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which your separation from service occurs.  To the extent any indemnification payment, expense reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit is determined to be subject to Section 409A (and not exempt pursuant to the prior sentence or otherwise), the amount of any such indemnification payment or expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one calendar year shall not affect the indemnification payment or provision of in-kind benefits or expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year (except for any life-time or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses), and in no event shall any indemnification payment or expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you incurred such indemnification payment or expenses, and in no event shall any right to indemnification payment or reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
