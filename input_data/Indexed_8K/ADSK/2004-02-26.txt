Exhibit 99.1 Autodesk Fourth Quarter Revenues Increase 51 Percent EPS Increases 700 percent SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Feb. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Autodesk, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADSK), the world's leading design software and digital content company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2004. For the fourth quarter, Autodesk reported net revenues of $295 million, a 51 percent increase over $196 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Fourth quarter net income was $58 million or $0.48 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and $53 million or $0.45 per diluted share on a pro-forma basis. Pro-forma net income excludes both the positive effect of a tax benefit of $7 million from the successful completion of an IRS audit of a previous year, and a $3 million restructuring charge. Net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $6 million or $0.06 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and $8 million or $0.07 per diluted share on a pro-forma basis. Pro-forma net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 excludes both a $7 million restructuring charge and the positive effect of a tax benefit of $4 million from closure of a prior year tax audit. "I am pleased with the company's outstanding performance during the quarter," said Carol Bartz, Autodesk chairman and CEO. "We saw strong growth across all divisions and all markets. Today's results clearly demonstrate that our strategies are working, our product offering has never been better and, most importantly, our customers are satisfied." Autodesk's strong performance was driven by a significant increase in upgrade revenues, the continuing success of the company's subscription program, and the company's commitment to improving profitability. During the quarter, the company retired its AutoCAD 2000-based products. Upgrade revenues increased 160 percent over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, to $100 million. In addition to strong growth in upgrade revenues, revenues from new seats grew 17 percent over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Subscription revenues, called Maintenance on the financial statements, increased 52 percent over the same quarter of the prior year, to $33 million. Subscription bookings increased 44 percent over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, as customers continue to recognize the value of the subscription program and the quick return on investment of Autodesk products. During the quarter, Autodesk continued to deliver on its commitment to improve profitability. Operating margins improved 19 percentage points over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, to 20 percent on a GAAP basis. Pro-forma operating margins, which exclude the $3 million restructuring charge, were 21 percent in the quarter. These results demonstrate the significant leverage in the company's operating margin and substantial progress toward the target operating margin range of 18 to 20 percent on an annual basis. Annual operating margins were 11 percent on a GAAP basis and 12 percent on a pro-forma basis, excluding the impact of the $3 million restructuring charge. "We are very optimistic about the coming year," said Bartz. "Our product line up has never been better. We have significant new releases of all major products coming at the same time or earlier than they were released last year, beginning with the new release of our AutoCAD 2005 family of products next month. In addition, we plan to introduce several significant new products, including Civil 3D for our Infrastructure customers, and new Linux-based releases for our Media customers. We have just begun our restructuring efforts and are firmly committed to improving profitability. We are on track to perform and execute. As a result, I have never been more enthusiastic heading into a new fiscal year." Net revenues for fiscal 2004 were $952 million, an increase of 15 percent compared to $825 million in fiscal 2003. Net income for fiscal 2004 was $120 million or $1.04 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and $96 million or $0.83 per diluted share on a pro-forma basis. Fiscal 2004 pro-forma results exclude the $3 million restructuring charge and the positive effects of tax benefits totaling $27 million. Net income in fiscal 2003 was $32 million or $0.28 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and $47 million or $0.41 per diluted share on a pro-forma basis. Fiscal 2003 pro-forma results exclude $26 million in restructuring charges and the positive effect of the tax benefit of $4 million. Operating Expense Presentation During the quarter, the company changed its allocation of certain costs, primarily information technology costs. This change has no impact to margins or profits. The company's results prepared under the new allocation methodology are attached to this press release and are available at www.autodesk.com/investor. Business Outlook The following statements are forward looking statements which are based on current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties some of which are set forth below. Q1 Fiscal 2005 Net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 are expected to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million. Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 are expected to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.17 on a GAAP basis and $0.16 to $0.21 on a pro forma basis. Full Year Fiscal 2005 For 2005, annual net revenue is expected to be in the range of $990 million to $1,010 million. Earnings per diluted share for the full year are expected to be in the range of $0.94 to $1.04 on a GAAP basis and $1.15 to $1.25 on a pro-forma basis.

These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of Autodesk's underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. For example, the pro forma results are an indication of our baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, these adjusted pro forma results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or diluted net income per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

These adjustments to our GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of Autodesk's underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance. For example, the pro forma results are an indication of our baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results. In addition, these adjusted pro forma results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or diluted net income per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
