Exhibit 99.1 Autodesk First Quarter Revenues Increase 41 Percent EPS Increases 414 Percent SAN RAFAEL, Calif., May 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Autodesk, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADSK), the world's leading design software and digital content company, today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2004. For the first quarter, Autodesk reported net revenues of $298 million, a 41 percent increase over $211 million reported in the first quarter of the prior year. First quarter net income was $43 million, or $0.36 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and $49 million, or $0.41 per diluted share on a pro-forma basis. Pro-forma net income excludes an $8 million restructuring charge. Net income in the first quarter of the prior year was $8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. There were no pro-forma adjustments in the prior year. "I am pleased with the company's outstanding performance during the quarter," said Carol Bartz, Autodesk chairman and CEO. "Strong new releases of our AutoCAD 2005 family of products, led to outstanding results in all markets and divisions. Customers are responding enthusiastically to the improved performance and increased functionality in the new versions." Autodesk's strong performance was driven by significant increases in revenue from new seats and upgrades, the continuing success of the company's subscription program, and the company's commitment to improving profitability. During the quarter, the company launched its AutoCAD(R) 2005 family of products, demonstrating the company's continued commitment to delivering lifecycle management solutions to customers. AutoCAD 2005 improves productivity and collaboration by providing the functionality needed for efficient workflow processes and allowing users to create, manage and share complex data and design information more easily. Subscription revenues, called Maintenance on the financial statements, increased 56 percent over the prior year, to $37 million, as customers continue to recognize the value of the subscription program and the quick return on investment of Autodesk products. During the quarter, Autodesk continued to deliver on its commitment to improve profitability. Operating margins improved 15 percentage points over the first quarter of fiscal 2004, to 18 percent on a GAAP basis. Pro-forma operating margins, which exclude the $8 million restructuring charge, were 21 percent in the quarter. These results demonstrate the significant leverage in the company's operating margin. "We got off to a great start in Fiscal Year 2005," said Bartz. "We introduced the AutoCAD 2005 family of products, one of our strongest product offerings ever, just two months after the retirement of AutoCAD 2000. In addition to the successful launch of AutoCAD 2005 family of products, we plan to release significant new versions of all of our other major products this year, including Autodesk Inventor Series, Autodesk Inventor Professional and 3ds max. Our refreshed product line and our focus on increasing profitability combined with the improved global economy, position the company for strong future growth." Business Outlook -- The following statements are forward looking statements which are based on current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties some of which are set forth below. Q2 Fiscal 2005 Net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 are expected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million. Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 are expected to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.26 on a GAAP basis and $0.26 to $0.30 on a pro-forma basis.
