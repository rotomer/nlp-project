Item 5. Other Events
 
On June 1, 2004, the Board of Directors of Autodesk, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), approved an amendment to its Rights Agreement, originally adopted in 1995, to eliminate all requirements  sometimes referred to as "dead hand" provisions  that only "Continuing Directors" approve certain actions under the Rights Agreement. A "Continuing Director" was generally defined as a member of the Board of Directors who was not associated with a person commencing an unsolicited hostile takeover of the Company. As a result of the amendment, decisions previously to be made pursuant to the Rights Agreement by Continuing Directors will now instead be made by a majority of all the directors in office at the time.
 
Effective June 1, 2004, director Mark A. Bertelsen has resigned as a member of the Company's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
