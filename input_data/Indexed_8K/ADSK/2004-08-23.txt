Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On August 19, 2004, Autodesk, Inc. issued a press release reporting its results for the three months and six months ended July 31, 2004 which included Autodesk's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended July 31, 2004 and July 31, 2003. Within the cash flow statements, the amounts related to business combinations were inadvertently reported under the caption "Capital and other expenditures" and amounts related to capital and other expenditures were inadvertently reported under the caption "Business combinations." This inadvertent transposition did not affect the total cash used in or provided by investing activities nor total cash generated during the period, or other items on the financial statements. Corrected Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
