On October 4, 2005, Autodesk announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alias. In the announcement, Autodesk estimated that the transaction would close within four to six months of the signing of the definitive agreement. Upon conclusion of an independent valuation of Alias' U.S. assets, Autodesk has now determined that the previously anticipated Hart-Scott-Rodino filing is not required. Accordingly, Autodesk currently estimates that the transaction will close late in the fourth fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2006 or early in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, subject to satisfaction of normal regulatory and other closing conditions.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
