On March 31, 2006, the Board of Directors of Autodesk, Inc. ("Autodesk") approved an Amended and Restated Executive Change in Control Program (the "Plan"). The Plan was originally approved by the Board of Directors in 2000 and provides for certain payments to participants whose employment is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the Plan) within twelve months following a "change in control" (as defined in the Plan), provided the participant executes a release and non competition agreement. Payments to such participants would include: (i) cash payments equal to the participant's "annual base compensation" and "average annual bonus" (each as defined in the Plan), (ii) the acceleration of vesting of such participant's unvested stock options with respect to the number of shares that would have otherwise vested within the twelve (12) months following the date of the participant's termination of employment and (iii) payment of medical, dental and vision insurance coverage for the participant and certain of the participant's "family members" (as defined in the Plan) for up to twelve (12) months. Participants are designated by the Board of Directors and may change from time to time. The participants include each executive officer of the Company.
The Plan has been amended and restated primarily (i) to provide that payments to participants may also be made if a participant voluntarily terminates his or her own employment on account of "good reason" (as defined in the Plan) within twelve months following a change in control and (ii) to extend its term from three years until such time as it may be terminated by the Board of Directors. Certain tax related changes and other conforming changes have also been made. A copy of the Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Other Termination
 
In the event that the benefits provided for in this Plan otherwise constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and would, but for this Article V be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax") , then the Participant's benefits under Article IV shall be either:
(i) delivered in full, or
(ii) delivered as to such lesser extent as would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Participant on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless the Company and the Participant otherwise agree in writing, all determinations required to be made under this Article, including the manner and amount of any reduction in the Participant's benefits under Article IV, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made in writing in good faith by the accounting firm serving as the Company's independent public accountants immediately prior to the event giving rise to such Payment (the "Accountants"). For purposes of making the calculations required by this Article V, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request to make a determination under this Article. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Article.
Benefits and any administrative expenses arising in connection with the Plan shall be paid as needed solely from the general assets of the Company. No contributions are required from any Participant. This Plan shall not be construed to require the Company to fund any of the benefits provided hereunder nor to establish a trust for such purpose. Participants' rights against the Company with respect to severance and other benefits provided under this Plan shall be those of general unsecured creditors. No Participant has an interest in his or her severance or other benefits under this Plan until the Participant actually receives a payment.
 
In the event any claim for benefits is denied, in whole or in part, the Company shall notify the claimant of such denial in writing and shall advise the claimant of his or her right to appeal the denial. Such written notice shall set forth the specific reasons for the denial and shall be given to the claimant within ninety (90) days after the Company receives his or her claim.
A. . In the event the Board receives appeals from denials of claims for benefits under the Plan, it may appoint a committee of non-Participants (a "Review Panel") to act as fiduciary to the Plan to act on such appeals.
Review Panel
B. . Any person whose claim for benefits is denied, in whole or in part, may appeal from the denial by submitting a written request for review of the claim within sixty (60) days after receiving written notice of the denial from the Company.
Right to Appeal
C. . A request for review must be made in writing and shall be addressed as follows: "Board of Directors, Autodesk, Inc., c/o General Counsel, 111 McInnis Parkway, San Rafael, CA 94903." A request for review shall set forth all of the grounds upon which it is based, all facts and support thereof and any other matters that the claimant deems pertinent.
Form of Request for Review
D. . Within sixty (60) days after receipt of a request for review, the Board or the designated Review Panel shall give written notice of its decision to the claimant and the Company. In the event the denial of the claim for benefits is confirmed, in whole or in part, such notice shall set forth, in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, specific reasons for such denial and specific references to the Plan provisions on which the decision was based. In the event that the Board or the Review Panel determines that the claim for benefits should not have been denied, in whole or in part, the Company shall take appropriate remedial action as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving notice of the decision.
Review Decision
A. . This Plan does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the Participant or the Company any obligation to retain the Participant as an Employee, to change the status of the Participant's employment, or to change the Company's policies regarding termination of employment. The Participant's employment is and shall continue to be "at-will", as defined under applicable law. If the Participant's employment with the Company or a successor entity terminates for any reason, the Participant shall not be entitled to any payments, benefits, damages, awards or compensation other than as provided by this Plan, or as may otherwise be available in accordance with the Company's established employee plans and practices or other agreements with the Company at the time of termination.
Employment Status
 
B. . All payments made pursuant to this Plan shall be subject to all applicable reporting obligations and any tax or other contributions required to be withheld under Federal, state or local law, or the applicable laws of any non-U.S. taxing authority as interpreted by the Company.

For all purposes under this Plan, the term "Company" shall include any successor to the Company's business and/or assets which executes and delivers the assumption agreement described in this subsection or which becomes bound by the terms of this Plan by operation of law.
Company's Successors
B. . All rights of the Participant hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Participant's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributes, devisees and legatees.
Participant's Successors
A. . This Plan shall remain in effect until terminated by the Board. The Board reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time, without advance notice to any Participant; provided, however, that, prior to a Change of Control, the Company shall provide six (6) months advance notice to each Participant of any amendment or termination of the Plan that would be adverse to the Participant with respect to eligibility or amount of payments or benefits hereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding, commencing on the date of a Change of Control, no amendment or termination of the Plan shall reduce the payments or benefits payable to any Participant who terminates employment within twelve (12) months after the Change of Control (unless the affected Participant consents in writing to such amendment or termination). Any action of the Company in amending or terminating the Plan will be taken in a non-fiduciary capacity. A termination of this Plan pursuant to the preceding sentences shall be effective for all purposes, except that such termination shall not affect the payment or provision of compensation or benefits earned by a Participant prior to the termination of this Plan.
Duration, Amendment and Termination
A. . Notices and all other communications contemplated by this Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed by U.S. registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid.

The Board may delegate to any other person all or any portion of its authority or responsibility with respect to the Plan.
Administration
D. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan, if the Company determines, in its good faith judgment, that Section 409A of the Code will result in the imposition of additional tax to an earlier payment of any payment or benefit otherwise due to a Participant under the Plan during the six (6) month period following the Participant's Termination Date, such payments or benefits will accrue during the six (6) month period and will become payable in a lump sum payment on the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the Termination Date.
