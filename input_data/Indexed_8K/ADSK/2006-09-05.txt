As previously disclosed on August 17, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Autodesk, Inc. (the "Company") is conducting a review of the Company's stock option grant practices, with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel. As this review remains ongoing, the Company does not expect to be in a position to file its Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter by the September 11, 2006 deadline or the September 18, 2006 extended deadline. The Company contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission staff to inform them about the ongoing review and, as a result, received a request for information in connection with an informal inquiry. The Company is cooperating with the SEC in connection with the informal inquiry.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
