Election of Director
On March 26, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Autodesk, Inc. (the "Company") appointed Mary T. McDowell to the Board.
Ms. McDowell will participate in the non-employee director compensation arrangements described in the Company's 2009 annual proxy statement filed with the SEC on April 28, 2009. Under the terms of those arrangements, she will receive, among other things, annual compensation of $75,000 and an initial option granted under the Company's 2010 Outside Directors' Stock Plan to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, which vests over a three-year period. In addition, it is expected that each new director will execute the Company's standard form of indemnification agreement.
Ms. McDowell is not a party to any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. The Board has not yet appointed Ms. McDowell to any Board committees.
On March 30, 2010, the Company issued a press release regarding the election of Ms. McDowell to the Board. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Approval of Executive Participation in Executive Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2011
On March 25, 2010, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board determined that, for fiscal year 2011, each of the Company's executive officers would be eligible to participate in the Executive Incentive Plan (the "EIP"). The EIP is an annual cash incentive plan intended to motivate and reward participants to ensure the Company achieves its annual financial and non-financial objectives.
For each executive officer participant, the Compensation Committee previously established a target award equal to a specified percentage of such participant's base salary ranging from 16.7% to 100% (the "Participant's Target Amount"). The Compensation Committee determined a funding/payout formula for the EIP in general and for each participant individually related to achievement of certain revenues for fiscal 2011, as well as certain non-GAAP operating margin levels for fiscal 2011.
The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2011 (if any) will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee and other factors set forth in the EIP, such as individual performance. Accordingly, each participant could receive a bonus ranging from zero percent of the Participant's Target Amount (for performance falling short of the goals) to a percentage in excess of the Participant's Target Amount (for performance exceeding the goals). The Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not increase above the aggregate EIP funding levels) the bonus that otherwise would be payable to the executive officers based on actual performance. Moreover, an executive officer participant must be an employee on the date of the bonus payout for fiscal year 2011 (if any) in order to be eligible for any bonus.
Sales Commission Plan with Ken Bado
On March 25, 2010, the Compensation Committee approved the compensation targets for Ken Bado, our Executive Vice President, Sales and Services, under the Sales Commission Plan for fiscal year 2011. Mr. Bado's Sales Commission Plan ties a portion of his targeted cash compensation to sales commissions based on achievement of specific revenue and contribution margin objectives. For fiscal year 2011, Mr. Bado's commission-based cash incentive target was set at approximately 38% of his overall targeted cash compensation, which includes base salary and short term cash incentives (including, but not limited to, Mr. Bado's participation in the Autodesk Executive Incentive Plan and commission-based cash incentive).
Forms of Award Agreements under the 2010 Outside Directors' Stock Plan
On March 26, 2010, the Board approved new forms of award agreements under the Company's 2010 Outside Directors' Stock Plan for certain stock option and restricted stock grants to the Company's non-employee directors.
The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the forms of agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
On March 26, 2010, the Board amended Article III, Section 3.2 of the Company's Bylaws to change the number of directors from eight (8) to nine (9). The Bylaws are filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

The chairperson of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the annual meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5(a), and, if the chairperson should so determine, he or she shall so declare at the annual meeting that any such business not properly brought before the annual meeting shall not be conducted. The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5(a) shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at an annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees of the board of directors, but in connection therewith no new business shall be acted upon at any such meeting unless stated, filed and received as herein provided.
(iv) In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5(a), a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of state law and of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.5(a), including, with respect to business such stockholder intends to bring before the annual meeting that involves a proposal that such stockholder requests to be included in the corporation's proxy statement, the requirements of Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act.

Stockholder Action and Request for Record Date
The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the board of directors or as otherwise established under this Section 2.10. Any person seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice addressed to the secretary of the corporation and delivered to the corporation and signed by a stockholder of record, request that a record date be fixed for such purpose. The written notice must contain the information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

The record date for such purpose shall be no more than ten (10) calendar days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the board of directors fails within ten (10) calendar days after the corporation receives such notice to fix a record date for such purpose, provided that the request is valid and fixing a record date is appropriate, the record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered to the corporation in the manner described in paragraph (d) of this Section 2.10; except that, if prior action by the board of directors is required under the provisions of Delaware law, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
(b) . Any stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a) of this Section 2.10 must describe the action that the stockholder proposes to take by consent. For each such proposal, every notice by a stockholder must include the information required by Section 2.5 as though such stockholder was intending to make a nomination or to bring any other matter before a meeting of stockholders, and, to the extent not otherwise required by Section 2.5, such notice must also state, (i) the text of the proposal (including the text of any resolutions to be effected by consent and the language of any proposed amendment to the bylaws of the corporation), (ii) the reasons for soliciting consents for the proposal, (iii) any material interest in the proposal held by the stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the action is to be taken, and (iv) any other information relating to the stockholder, the beneficial owner, or the proposal that would be required to be disclosed in filings in connection with the solicitation of proxies or consents pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (or any successor provision of the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder).
Notice Requirements
(c) . Every written consent purporting to take or authorize the taking of corporate action (each such written consent is referred to in this paragraph and in paragraph (d) as a "Consent") must bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the Consent, and no Consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated Consent delivered in the manner required by this Section 2.10, Consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are so delivered to the corporation.
Date of Consent
(d) . Every Consent must be delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the state of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which the proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery must be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
Delivery of Consent / Inspectors of Election
Within five (5) business days after receipt of the earliest dated Consent delivered to the corporation in the manner provided above or the determination by the board of directors that the corporation should seek corporate action by written consent, as the case may be, the secretary of the corporation shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. The cost of retaining inspectors of election shall be borne by the corporation.

If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as far as applicable.

RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than as provided for in Article II of these bylaws, the board of directors may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) calendar days before any such action. In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.

Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
8.4 .
STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
Stock of the corporation shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the corporation only by the record holder of such stock or by his or her attorney lawfully constituted in writing and, if such stock is certificated, upon the surrender of the certificate to the secretary of the corporation or transfer agent therefor, which shall be canceled before a new certificate shall be issued.
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
8.5 .
SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on
 
the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.6 .
LOST CERTIFICATES
Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
8.7 .
TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS
The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
8.8 .

Taxation Upon Exercise of Optio

(ii) Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, nor prevent that party from thereafter enforcing any other provision of this Agreement. The rights granted both parties hereunder are cumulative and shall not constitute a waiver of either party's right to assert any other legal remedy available to it.
(iii) The Optionee agrees upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement.
(iv) OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF OPTIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 2 HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING SERVICE AS AN OUTSIDE DIRECTOR (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING GRANTED AN OPTION HEREUNDER). OPTIONEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AS AN OUTSIDE DIRECTOR FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE WITH OPTIONEE'S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE OPTIONEE'S DIRECTORSHIP AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.
