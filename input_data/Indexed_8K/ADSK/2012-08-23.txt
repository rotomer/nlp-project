Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On
August 23, 2012
, Autodesk, Inc. (Autodesk or the Company) issued a press release and prepared remarks reporting financial results for the
second
quarter ended
July 31, 2012
.  The press release and prepared remarks are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement Autodesks consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and prepared remarks furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to historical non-GAAP net earnings and historical and future non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share. For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, Autodesks management uses non-GAAP measures that do not include: (a) stock-based compensation expenses, (b) amortization of purchased intangibles and purchases of technology, (c) restructuring charges, (d) gains and losses on strategic investments, (e) discrete tax items, and (f) the income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses.  Autodesks management uses non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Autodesks earning potential. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors historical results and operating guidance.
 
As described above, Autodesk excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
 
A.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
Autodesk excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
 
B.
Amortization of purchased intangibles and purchases of technology.
Autodesk incurs amortization of acquisition-related purchased intangible assets, primarily in connection with its acquisition of certain businesses and technologies. The amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity, and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
 
C.
Restructuring charges.
These expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. In connection with these restructuring actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, and the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
D.
Gains and losses on strategic investments.
Autodesk excludes gains and losses related to our strategic investments from its non-GAAP measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results. Included in these amounts are non-cash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components, realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments.
 
E.
Discrete tax items
. Autodesk excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-GAAP measure of income, and include a non-GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate. Discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation. Examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law. Management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to
ongoing operations.
F.
Income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses
. The income tax effects that are excluded from the non-GAAP measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non- GAAP costs and expenses, primarily due to stock-based compensation, purchased intangibles and restructuring for GAAP and non-GAAP measures.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.
Item 2.05
    
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On August 22, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a world-wide restructuring plan that includes a reduction in force and the consolidation of certain leased facilities. The Company expects to substantially complete the reduction in force and the facilities consolidation by the end of its fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (ending January 31, 2013). The Company anticipates incurring pre-tax restructuring charges of $50 million to $60 million, all of which would result in cash expenditures and of which $44 million to $52 million would be for one-time employee termination benefits and $6 million to $8 million would be for facilities-related costs. Approximately $40 million to $45 million of these pre-tax charges will be expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 (ending October 31, 2012) with most of the remainder in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
The Company is taking these actions to execute on its strategy including its continuing shift to cloud and mobile computing. While the Company is reducing its overall staffing levels in the near-term, the Company will continue to invest in key development areas. Additionally, the restructuring helps reduce costs and streamline the organization as a continuation of Company activities begun earlier in the year.

AUTODESK REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Announces Restructuring to Accelerate Transition to Cloud and Mobile Computing
SAN RAFAEL, Calif.,
AUGUST 23, 2012
--
Autodesk, Inc.
(NASDAQ: ADSK) today reported financial results for the
second
quarter of fiscal year
2013
.
 
Second Quarter Fiscal 2013
"Our own execution challenges, combined with an uneven global economy, resulted in disappointing revenue results for the quarter, said
Carl Bass
, Autodesk president and CEO. Organizational changes we made within the company earlier this year slowed us down during the quarter. Despite our second quarter results, the changes better position Autodesk to meet the needs of our customers. We are focused on working through our internal challenges as rapidly as possible."
"Given the uneven macroeconomic environment and the company's desire to deliver operating margin improvement, we have taken a prudent approach to spending in fiscal 2013," continued Bass. "Our ongoing cost management measures contributed to the delivery of non-GAAP EPS within our guidance range for the second quarter."

compared to the
second

10 percent
on a constant currency basis. Revenue from emerging economies was

$85 million
, an increase of
5 percent
compared to the

quarter last year.
Deferred revenue at the end of the
second
quarter was a record high of
$752 million
, an increase of 17 percent compared to the

Restructuring
As part of today's announcement, Autodesk shared plans for a restructuring related to executing on the company's strategy including its continuing shift to cloud and mobile computing. While Autodesk is reducing its overall staffing levels in the near-term, the company will continue to invest in key development areas. In addition, the company intends to consolidate certain leased facilities.
   
The company anticipates taking a pre-tax charge in the range of $50 million to $60 million in connection with the restructuring. Approximately $40 million to $45 million of the pre-tax charges will be taken in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Most of the remaining charge will be taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
2
This restructuring is squarely focused on our continued transformation and shift to more cloud and mobile computing," continued Bass. "This action allows us to continue to invest in recruiting and hiring people who can bring Autodesk the skills and experience that are critical for achieving our mid and long-term goals. As part of the ongoing platform shift, it's clear to us that design and engineering software will move to cloud and mobile platforms. Cloud and mobile has been a major investment area for Autodesk over the past couple of years and this restructuring will accelerate our progress as we intend to further invest in employees with expertise and skill sets essential to this transition. Additionally, this restructuring helps us reduce costs and streamline the organization as a continuation of the activities we began earlier this year."
Separately, in response to the company's second quarter performance, the uneven economic environment, and outlook for the rest of the year, Autodesk is implementing further spend management measures, such as reducing non-sales related travel and the number of its contractors.
The company expects the combined restructuring and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by planned investments, will result in pre-tax spend (operating expenses plus cost of goods sold) increasing in the second half of fiscal 2013 by between 7 and 11 percent compared to the second half of fiscal 2012 on a GAAP basis and ranging between -2 and 2 percent on a non-GAAP basis. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP in the pre-tax spend range comparisons is due to the exclusion from non-GAAP pre-tax spend of approximately 5 percent related to stock-based compensation expense, approximately 2 percent for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, and approximately 2 percent related to restructuring charges, which are included in total GAAP pre-tax spend.
"Although the economic environment is challenging, our market opportunity and prospects remain strong and we remain committed to achieving our long-term growth targets by the end of fiscal 2015," concluded Bass.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties some of which are set forth below. Autodesk's business outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2013 assumes a continuation of the current economic environment and foreign exchange currency rate environment.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2013
3
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share exclude $0.18 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.12 related to restructuring charges, and $0.08 for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, net of tax.
Full Year Fiscal 2013
Net revenue for fiscal 2013 is now expected to increase by 4 percent to 6 percent compared to fiscal 2012. Autodesk now anticipates fiscal 2013 GAAP operating margin to decrease by approximately 210 basis points and non-GAAP operating margin to increase by approximately 150 basis points compared to fiscal 2012.  A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for fiscal 2013 is provided in the tables following this press release.
Both third quarter fiscal 2013 and full year fiscal 2013 outlooks assume annual effective tax rates of approximately 25 percent and 25.5 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. These rate do not include the federal R&D tax credit benefit, which expired on December 31, 2011, or one-time discrete items. The assumed effective tax rate will be adjusted if or when there is a renewal of the tax credit.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Overview
Execution challenges, combined with an uneven global economy, resulted in disappointing revenue results for the quarter.
The shortfall in revenue did not emerge until July as our demand generation activities did not produce the anticipated effect. The organizational realignment, combined with an uneven economic environment, limited our ability to both identify the shortfall earlier and respond more quickly. While we experienced pockets of strength in countries like Japan and China, which pushed us to record revenues in Asia Pacific, many markets around the world slowed during the quarter.
With the backdrop of an uneven macroeconomic environment and our focus on delivering on our operating margin improvement goals, Autodesk has been taking a prudent approach to spending for the fiscal year. The company's ongoing cost management measures contributed to the delivery of non-GAAP EPS within its guidance range for the second quarter.
Second quarter performance included:
1
3 percent
compared to the
first
quarter of fiscal 2013.
Revenue Analysis
Total net revenue for the second quarter
increased
by
4 percent
to
$569 million
, as compared to the
second
quarter last year as reported and
4 percent
on a constant currency basis. Total net revenue for the
second
quarter
decreased
3 percent
sequentially as reported and 2 percent on a constant currency basis. The sequential decrease was impacted by a headwind related to foreign currency exchange rates.
License and other revenue
increased
by
2 percent
to
$341 million
, as compared to the
second
quarter last year, and decreased 6 percent sequentially.
Revenue from commercial new licenses increased

second
quarter last year, and declined 3 percent sequentially.
2
Maintenance revenue
increased
by
7 percent
to
$228 million
, as compared to the
second
quarter last year, and was flat sequentially.
Net maintenance billings increased 7 percent compared to the
second
quarter last year, and increased 4 percent sequentially. Most of the year-over-year and sequential growth in net maintenance billings resulted from multi-year maintenance renewal activity related to a pricing change that took effect on August 1st.
Revenue by Geography
Revenue in EMEA
decreased
1 percent
to
$210 million
, as compared to the
second
quarter last year as reported and increased
1 percent
on a constant currency basis. EMEA revenue
decreased
7 percent
sequentially as reported and 4 percent on a constant currency basis. Our year-over-year performance in the EMEA region was varied by country. In general, solid growth in northern Europe was offset by weakness in southern and central Europe.
Revenue in the Americas
increased
4 percent
to
$199 million
, as compared to the
second
quarter last year and
decreased
4 percent
sequentially. The Americas region was led by year-over-year growth in the U.S., partially offset by weakness in Latin America.
Revenue in APAC
increased
12 percent
to a record
$161 million
, as compared to the
second
quarter last year as reported and
10 percent
on a constant currency basis. Revenue in APAC
increased
3 percent
sequentially as reported and 4 percent on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year growth in APAC was driven by strength in Japan and China, partially offset by weakness in India.
3
Revenue from emerging economies was
$88 million
, flat compared to the
second
quarter last year as reported and an increase of 2 percent on a constant currency basis. Results were mixed by country and geography. Year-over-year strength in China and Russia was offset by weaker results in Brazil and India. Revenue from emerging economies increased 8 percent sequentially as reported and 9 percent on a constant currency basis.
Revenue by Product Type
Revenue from Flagship products
increased
3 percent
to
$318 million
, compared to the
second
quarter last year, and
decreased
5 percent
sequentially. Year-over-year growth in Flagship was driven by AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD, which was partially offset by declines in other Flagship products.
Revenue from Suites was
$166 million
, or
29 percent
of total revenue. Revenue from Suites
increased
5 percent
compared to the
second
quarter last year, and was flat sequentially. Year-over-year growth was led by AEC suites, while Manufacturing suites declined slightly.
Revenue from New and Adjacent products
increased
5 percent
to
$85 million
compared to the
second
quarter last year, and
decreased
3 percent
sequentially. Year-over-year growth in New and Adjacent was driven by growth in consulting and simulation products.
Revenue by Business Segment
Revenue from our Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) segment
increased
10 percent
to
$218 million
, compared to the
second
quarter last year, and
decreased
5 percent
sequentially. Combined revenue
4
from AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT was $192 million, an increase of 12 percent compared to the
second
quarter last year, and a decrease of 8 percent sequentially. Revenue from PSEB suites grew 8 percent compared to the second quarter last year and 27 percent sequentially. The sequential growth in PSEB suites was driven by seasonally strong revenue from educational suites.
Revenue from our AEC business segment
increased
2 percent
to $
161 million
, compared to the
second
quarter last year, and
decreased
1 percent
sequentially. Revenue from our AEC suites increased 11 percent compared to the
second
quarter last year and decreased 6 percent sequentially. Year-over-year growth in AEC was led by the Americas and AEC suites, which was partially offset by weakness in APAC.
Revenue from our Manufacturing business segment
increased
4 percent
to
$141 million
, compared to the
second
quarter last year and
decreased
3 percent
sequentially. Revenue from our Manufacturing suites decreased 2 percent compared to the
second
quarter last year and 1 percent sequentially. Year-over-year growth in our manufacturing segment was led by growth in APAC and the Americas.
Revenue from our M&E business segment
decreased
10 percent
to
$49 million
, compared to the
second
quarter last year and
3 percent
sequentially. Revenue from our animation products including Maya, 3dsMax, and our Entertainment Creation Suites decreased 4 percent compared to the
second
quarter last year and 2 percent sequentially. As our customers migrate to our new suites, we are starting to see reported revenue for the stand-alone versions of those animation products decline. Revenue from Creative Finishing decreased 25 percent compared to the second quarter last year and 8 percent sequentially. The decrease in revenue from Creative Finishing is related to general weakness in all of the major geographies.
Margins and EPS Review
5
GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was
89 percent
. Non-GAAP gross margin in the
second
quarter was
91 percent
. The sequential decrease of both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin is primarily related to costs associated with the delivery of our Suites.
GAAP operating expenses
increased
6
percent year-over-year and decreased 5 percent sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5 percent year-over-year and decreased 5 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses is primarily related to higher employee related costs. The sequential decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses is related to ongoing cost management efforts during the second quarter and normal seasonality.  
GAAP operating margin was 16 percent and decreased 110 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25 percent and decreased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin was related to lower than expected revenue.
GAAP operating margin increased 30 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin increased 70 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin was driven by ongoing cost management efforts during the second quarter and normal spending seasonality.
6
The
second
quarter effective tax rate was
30 percent
and 25 percent for our GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. The GAAP tax rate was higher than the non-GAAP rate due to a discrete tax item associated with the write-off of our investments in OnLive, Inc. Both GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate benefited from the geographic mix of earnings.
Earnings per diluted share for the
second
quarter were
$0.28
GAAP, which includes a $0.05 negative impact related to the write-off of our investment in OnLive, Inc.  Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was
$0.48
.
The share count used to compute basic net income per share was
227.8 million
. The share count used to compute diluted net income per share was
232.1 million
.
A complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the tables following these prepared remarks.
Foreign Currency Impact
The foreign currency impact represents the U.S. Dollar impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our financial results as well as the impact of gains and losses from our hedging program.
Compared to the
second
quarter of last year, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of our hedging program was
$1 million
unfavorable on revenue and
$6 million
favorable on cost of revenue and operating expenses.
Compared to the
first
quarter of fiscal 2013, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedging was $8 million unfavorable on revenue and $4 million favorable on expenses.
7
Balance Sheet Items and Cash Review
Total cash and investments at the end of the
second
quarter was approximately
$1.7 billion
.
During the second quarter, Autodesk used approximately
$111 million
to repurchase
3.4 million
shares of common stock at an average price of
$32.23
per share.
Cash flow from operating activities during the second quarter was $
107 million
, a decrease of 19 percent compared to the
second
quarter last year and 23 percent sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential decrease is primarily due to a shift in billings linearity driving higher accounts receivable and corresponding days sales outstanding.
 
Days sales outstanding (DSO) was
58
days, an increase of 9 days compared to the
second
quarter last year and an increase of 12 days sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential increase is primarily due to a shift in billings linearity and an increase in multi-year maintenance renewal activity related to a pricing change that took effect on August 1st.
       
Deferred revenue was a record
$752 million
, an increase of 17 percent compared to the
second
quarter last year and 3 percent sequentially.  The year-over-year increase is primarily due to increased maintenance billings over the past four quarters and the impact of early maintenance renewals in advance of a pricing change that took effect on August 1st.  The sequential increase is primarily related to early maintenance renewals in advance of the pricing change.
8
Shippable backlog was
$7 million
, a decrease of $19 million compared to the
second
quarter last year and an increase of $1 million sequentially. At the end of the
second
quarter, channel inventory weeks remained at approximately one week.
Restructuring
Autodesk announced a restructuring related to executing on the company's strategy including its continuing shift to cloud and mobile computing. While Autodesk is reducing its overall staffing levels in the near-term, the company will continue to invest in key development areas. In addition, the company intends to consolidate certain leased facilities.
   
The company anticipates taking a pre-tax charge in the range of $50 million to $60 million in connection with the restructuring. Approximately $40 million to $45 million in pre-tax charges will be taken in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Most of the remaining charge will be taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
Separately, in response to the company's second quarter performance, the uneven economic environment, and outlook for the rest of the year, Autodesk is implementing further spend management measures, such as reducing non-sales related travel and the number of its contractors.
The company expects the combined restructuring and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by planned investments, will result in pre-tax spend (operating expenses plus cost of goods sold) in the second half of fiscal 2013 to increase by between 7 and 11 percent compared to the second half of fiscal 2012 on a GAAP basis and range between -2 and 2 percent on a non-GAAP basis. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP in the pre-tax spend range comparisons is due to the exclusion from non-GAAP pre-tax spend of approximately 5 percent related to stock-based compensation expense, approximately 2 percent for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, and approximately 2 percent related to restructuring charges, which are included in total GAAP pre-tax spend.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and
9
assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties some of which are set forth below. Autodesks business outlook for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2013 assumes a continuation of the current economic environment and foreign exchange currency rate environment and that we are able to successfully execute the restructuring described in our press release in a timely manner.
Third Quarter Fiscal 2013
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share exclude $0.18 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.12 related to restructuring charges, and $0.08 for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, net of tax.
The majority of the projected euro, yen and Australian dollar denominated net revenue for our third quarter fiscal 2013 has been hedged, which should substantially reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on our third quarter results. However, over an extended period of time, currency fluctuations will increasingly impact our results. We hedge our net exposures using a four quarter rolling layered hedge program. As such, a portion of the projected euro, yen, and Australian dollar denominated net revenue for our fiscal 2013 has been hedged. The closer to the current time period, the more we are hedged. See below for more details on our foreign currency hedging program.
Full Year Fiscal 2013
Net revenue for fiscal 2013 is now expected to increase by 4 percent to 6 percent compared to fiscal 2012. Autodesk now anticipates fiscal 2013 GAAP operating margin to decrease by approximately 210 basis points and non-GAAP operating margin to increase by approximately 150 basis points compared to fiscal 2012. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for fiscal 2013 is provided in the tables following these prepared remarks.
Both third quarter fiscal 2013 and full year fiscal 2013 outlooks assume annual effective tax rates of
10
approximately 25 percent and 25.5 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. These rates do not include the federal R&D tax credit benefit, which expired on December 31, 2011, or one-time discrete items. The assumed effective tax rate will be adjusted if or when there is a renewal of the tax credit. 
Autodesks Foreign Currency Hedging Program and Calculation of Constant Currency Growth
Given the recent foreign exchange volatility, we would like to provide a brief summary of how we handle foreign currency exchange hedging as well as a description of how we calculate constant currency growth rates. A few points on our hedging program include:
When we report period-over-period growth rate percentages on a constant currency basis, we attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses recorded within the current and comparative period. However, when we calculate the foreign currency impact of exchange rates in the current and comparative period on our financial results (See table in above Foreign Currency Impact section) we include the U.S. Dollar impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the impact of gains and losses recorded as a result of our hedging program.
