Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On
November 15, 2012
, Autodesk, Inc. (Autodesk or the Company) issued a press release and prepared remarks reporting financial results for the
third
quarter ended
October 31, 2012
.  The press release and prepared remarks are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement Autodesks consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and prepared remarks furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to historical non-GAAP net earnings and historical and future non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share. For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, Autodesks management uses non-GAAP measures that do not include: (a) stock-based compensation expenses, (b) amortization of purchased intangibles and purchases of technology, (c) restructuring charges, (d) gains and losses on strategic investments, (e) discrete tax items, and (f) the income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses.  Autodesks management uses non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Autodesks earning potential. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors historical results and operating guidance.
 
As described above, Autodesk excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
 
A.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
Autodesk excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
 
B.
Amortization of purchased intangibles and purchases of technology.
Autodesk incurs amortization of acquisition-related purchased intangible assets, primarily in connection with its acquisition of certain businesses and technologies. The amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity, and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
 
C.
Restructuring charges.
These expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. In connection with these restructuring actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, and the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts. We exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the current period.
D.
Gains and losses on strategic investments.
Autodesk excludes gains and losses related to our strategic investments from its non-GAAP measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results. Included in these amounts are non-cash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components, realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments.
 
E.
Discrete tax items
. Autodesk excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-GAAP measure of income, and include a non-GAAP tax provision based upon the projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate. Discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation. Examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law. Management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to
ongoing operations.
F.
Income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses
. The income tax effects that are excluded from the non-GAAP measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non- GAAP costs and expenses, primarily due to stock-based compensation, purchased intangibles and restructuring for GAAP and non-GAAP measures.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

AUTODESK REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
SAN RAFAEL, Calif.,
NOVEMBER 15, 2012
--
Autodesk, Inc.
(NASDAQ: ADSK) today reported financial results for the
third
quarter of fiscal year
2013
.
 
Third Quarter Fiscal 2013
Revenue was $
548 million
, compared to $549 million in the
third
quarter of fiscal 2012.
GAAP operating margin was
6 percent
, compared to 16 percent in the
third
quarter of fiscal 2012.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were
$0.13
, compared to $0.32 in the
third
quarter of fiscal 2012.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were
$0.47
, compared to $0.44 in the
third
quarter of fiscal 2012.
"Our revenue results were disappointing and were primarily caused by a weakening demand environment," said
Carl Bass
, Autodesk president and CEO. "While we experienced pockets of relative strength in the U.S., northern Europe, and Russia, most other markets around the world slowed during the quarter, most notably emerging markets. Despite our overall revenue shortfall, our ongoing focus on cost management delivered meaningful margin expansion and EPS above our guidance range."
Third Quarter Operational Overview
EMEA revenue
decreased
3 percent
to
$196 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year as reported and increased
3 percent
on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas
increased
4 percent
to $
209 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year. Revenue in Asia Pacific (APAC)
decreased
3 percent
to
$142 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year as reported and decreased
3 percent
on a constant currency basis. Revenue from emerging economies
decreased
9 percent
to $
80 million
,
1
compared to the
third
quarter last year as reported and 5 percent on a constant currency basis. Revenue from emerging economies represented
15 percent
of total revenue in the
third
quarter.
Revenue from the Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) segment
decreased
2 percent
to $
205 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year. Revenue from the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) business segment
increased
7 percent
to $
163 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year. Revenue from the Manufacturing business segment
decreased
1 percent
to
$132 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year. Revenue from the Media and Entertainment business segment
decreased
9 percent
to
$48 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year.
Revenue from Flagship products
decreased
4 percent
to
$298 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year. Revenue from Suites
increased
10 percent
to
$166 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year. Revenue from New and Adjacent products
decreased
3 percent
to
$84 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year.
In the third quarter last year, Autodesk recognized a $10 million, one-time transaction, related to license compliance. This transaction impacted revenue growth rates for license and other, APAC, PSEB, and Flagship. In addition, Superstorm Sandy negatively impacted our business during the last few days of the quarter.
Deferred revenue increased 15 percent to
$714 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year.
"We achieved strong growth in non-GAAP operating margin, better than expected EPS, strong cash flow from operations, and growth in deferred revenue," said Mark Hawkins, Autodesk executive vice president, chief financial officer. "While our revenue growth target for fiscal 2013 is below our original target, we believe we can still achieve year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin expansion of between 80 and 140 basis points. With over $1.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, our balance sheet remains solid.
"Looking forward, due to the increasing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and our slower than planned revenue growth in fiscal 2013, we are reassessing our long-term financial model (through fiscal 2015) and are not providing revenue targets at this time," continued Hawkins. "While revenue growth will be a key determining factor in the years to come, we remain committed to growing our non-GAAP operating margin and believe we can achieve a 30+ percent run rate as we exit our fiscal 2015."
   
Business Outlook
2
The following statements are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties some of which are set forth below. Autodesk's business outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 assumes a continuation of the current economic environment and foreign exchange currency rate environment.
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share exclude $0.13 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.03 related to restructuring charges, and $0.09 for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, net of tax.
Full Year Fiscal 2013
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share exclude $0.50 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.14 related to restructuring charges, $0.26 for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles and $0.02 for loss on strategic investments, net of tax.
A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for fiscal 2013 is provided in the tables following this press release.
Both fourth quarter fiscal 2013 and full year fiscal 2013 outlooks assume annual effective tax rates of approximately 24.5 percent and 25.5 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. These rates do not include the federal R&D tax credit benefit, which expired on December 31, 2011, or one-time discrete items. The assumed effective tax rate will be adjusted if or when there is a renewal of the tax credit.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Overview
We experienced disappointing revenue results stemming from a weakening demand environment. While we experienced pockets of relative strength in the U.S., northern Europe, and Russia, most other markets around the world slowed during the quarter, most notably emerging markets.
In addition, we faced a difficult year-over-year comparison due to a large ($10 million), one-time license compliance transaction in the third quarter last year, as well as Superstorm Sandy negatively impacting our business in the U.S. during the last few days of our quarter.
Autodesk's ongoing focus on cost management delivered meaningful margin expansion and EPS above our guidance range. We also generated strong cash flow from operations and growth in deferred revenue.
Third quarter performance included:
1
Revenue Analysis
Total net revenue for the
third
quarter was
$548 million
, roughly flat with the
third
quarter last year as reported and an increase of
2 percent
on a constant currency basis. Total net revenue for the
third
quarter
decreased
4 percent
sequentially as reported and 3 percent on a constant currency basis.
License and other revenue
decreased
4 percent
to
$317 million
, as compared to the
third
quarter last year, and 7 percent sequentially. The year-over-year comparison was impacted by the large, one-time license compliance transaction in the third quarter last year.
Revenue from commercial new licenses increased
3 percent
compared to the
third
quarter last year, and decreased 9 percent sequentially.
Maintenance revenue
increased
6 percent
to
$231 million
, as compared to the
third
quarter last year, and 1 percent sequentially.
2
Net maintenance billings decreased
5 percent
compared to the
third
quarter last year, and 24 percent sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential decline is primarily related to a difficult compare as a portion of typical third quarter maintenance contracts were renewed early in advance of a pricing change.
Revenue by Geography
Revenue in EMEA
decreased
3 percent
to
$196 million
, as compared to the
third
quarter last year as reported and increased
3 percent
on a constant currency basis. EMEA revenue
decreased
6 percent
sequentially as reported and 5 percent on a constant currency basis. Our year-over-year performance in the EMEA region was varied by country. In general, strength in northern Europe was more than offset by weakness in southern Europe.
Revenue in the Americas
increased
4 percent
to $
209 million
, as compared to the
third
quarter last year and
increased
5 percent
sequentially. The Americas region was led by year-over-year growth in the U.S., partially offset by weakness in most of the region.
Revenue in APAC
decreased
3 percent
to
$142 million
, as compared to the
third
quarter last year as reported and
3 percent
on a constant currency basis. Revenue in APAC
decreased
11 percent
sequentially as reported and 12 percent on a constant currency basis. APAC, particularly Japan, faced a difficult year-over-year comparison because of the large, one-time license compliance transaction in the third quarter last year. Normalizing for this transaction, Japan performed well while the company experienced continued weakness in China and India.
Revenue from emerging economies was
$80 million
, a decrease of
9 percent
compared to the
third
quarter last year as reported and 5 percent on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year strength in Russia was more than offset by weaker results in China, India and Brazil. Revenue from emerging economies decreased 10 percent sequentially as reported and 9 percent on a constant currency basis.
3
Revenue by Product Type
Revenue from Flagship products
decreased
4 percent
to
$298 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year, and
decreased
7 percent
sequentially. Flagship faced a difficult year-over-year comparison because of the large, one-time license compliance transaction in the third quarter last year. In addition, Flagship experienced declines in stand-alone products such as AutoCAD Mechanical and AutoCAD Architecture as customers migrate to suites.
Revenue from Suites was
$166 million
, or
30 percent
of total revenue. Revenue from Suites
increased
10 percent
compared to the
third
quarter last year, and was flat sequentially. Year-over-year growth was led by AEC suites.
Revenue from New and Adjacent products
decreased
3 percent
to
$84 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year, and
increased
2 percent
sequentially.
As our customers migrate from our stand-alone products to Suites, we anticipate that our revenue from Suites will increase as a percentage of total revenue and that our revenue from our Flagship and New and Adjacent products will similarly decline as a percentage of total revenue.
Revenue by Business Segment
Revenue from our PSEB segment
decreased
2 percent
to $
205 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year, and
decreased
6 percent
sequentially. Combined revenue from AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT was $180 million, an increase of 6 percent compared to the
third
quarter last year, and a decrease of 6 percent sequentially. PSEB also faced a difficult year-over-year comparison because of the large, one-time license
4
compliance transaction in the third quarter last year. Revenue from PSEB suites decreased 12 percent compared to the third quarter last year and 7 percent sequentially. Year-over-year growth in the AutoCAD suites was strong, while educational suites experienced a sharp decline against a difficult compare in the third quarter last year.
Revenue from our AEC business segment
increased
7 percent
to $
163 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year, and
increased
1 percent
sequentially. Revenue from our AEC suites increased 26 percent compared to the
third
quarter last year and 4 percent sequentially. Year-over-year growth in AEC was led by the strong performance of AEC suites globally.
Revenue from our Manufacturing business segment
decreased
1 percent
to
$132 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year and
7 percent
sequentially. Revenue from our Manufacturing suites increased 4 percent compared to the
third
quarter last year and decreased 1 percent sequentially. Declines in stand-alone manufacturing products impacted the year-over-year and sequential comparison for the segment.
Revenue from our M&E business segment
decreased
9 percent
to
$48 million
, compared to the
third
quarter last year and
1 percent
sequentially. Revenue from our animation products including Maya, 3dsMax, and our Entertainment Creation Suites decreased 10 percent compared to the
third
quarter last year and decreased 3 percent sequentially. As expected, we are starting to see reported revenue for the stand-alone versions of animation products decline as our customers migrate to our new suites. Revenue from Creative Finishing decreased 7 percent compared to the
third
quarter last year and increased 7 percent sequentially.
Margins and EPS Review
5
GAAP gross margin in the
third
quarter was
89 percent
. Non-GAAP gross margin in the
third
quarter was
91 percent
. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were flat year-over-year and sequentially.
In August 2012, Autodesk announced a restructuring related to executing on the company's strategy including its continuing shift to cloud and mobile computing. As such, the company took a GAAP pre-tax charge of $35 million in the third quarter.
GAAP operating expenses
increased
14 percent
year-over-year and 10 percent sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 3 percent year-over-year and 5 percent sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential increase in GAAP operating expenses is primarily related to restructuring related costs. The year-over-year and sequential decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses is related to reduced employee related costs related to the restructuring and ongoing cost management efforts during the third quarter.  
GAAP operating margin was
6 percent
and decreased year-over-year and sequentially primarily related to restructuring costs and lower than expected revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was
26 percent
and increased 190 basis points compared to the third quarter last year and 120 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating margin was related to ongoing cost management efforts during the third quarter.
The
third
quarter effective tax rate was
14 percent
and 25.5 percent for our GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. The GAAP tax rate was lower than the non-GAAP rate primarily due to discrete tax items primarily associated with the restructuring and stock-based compensation.
Earnings per diluted share for the
third
quarter were
$0.13
GAAP, which includes a $0.15 negative impact related to the restructuring.  Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter were
$0.47
.
The share count used to compute basic net income per share was
225.5 million
. The share count used to compute diluted net income per share was
230.5 million
.
A complete reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in the tables following these prepared remarks.
Foreign Currency Impact
6
The foreign currency impact represents the U.S. Dollar impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our financial results as well as the impact of gains and losses from our hedging program.
Compared to the
third
quarter of last year, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates including the impact of our hedging program was
10 million
unfavorable on revenue and
7 million
favorable on cost of revenue and operating expenses.
Compared to the
second
quarter of fiscal 2013, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and hedging was $2 million unfavorable on revenue and no impact on expenses.
Balance Sheet Items and Cash Review
Total cash and investments at the end of the
third
quarter was approximately $1.7 billion.
During the second quarter, Autodesk used approximately
$130 million
to repurchase
4 million
shares of common stock at an average price of
$32.53
per share.
Cash flow from operating activities during the
third
quarter was $
157 million
, an increase of 14 percent compared to the
third
quarter last year and 47 percent sequentially. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the impact of certain excess tax benefits.  The sequential increase is due to a decrease in days sales outstanding (DSO) and the impact of certain excess tax benefits.
 
7
DSO was
49
days, an increase of 6 days compared to the
third
quarter last year and a decrease of 9 days sequentially. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to shifting in billings linearity. The sequential decline is primarily related to the decline in maintenance billings.
       
Deferred revenue was
$714 million
, an increase of 15 percent compared to the
third
quarter last year and a decrease of 5 percent sequentially.  The year-over-year increase is primarily due to increased maintenance billings over the past four quarters.  The sequential decrease is primarily related to the decrease in maintenance billings as a portion of typical third quarter maintenance contracts were renewed early in advance of a pricing change, as well as typical seasonality.
Shippable backlog was
$2 million
, a decrease of $20 million compared to the
third
quarter last year and $5 million sequentially. At the end of the
third
quarter, channel inventory was less than two weeks.
Business Outlook
The following statements are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties some of which are set forth below. Autodesks business outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 assumes a continuation of the current economic environment and foreign exchange currency rate environment.
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share exclude $0.13 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.03
related to restructuring charges, and $0.09 for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, net of tax.
The majority of the projected euro, yen and Australian dollar denominated net revenue for our fourth quarter fiscal 2013 has been hedged, which should substantially reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on our fourth quarter results. However, over an extended period of time, currency fluctuations will increasingly impact our results. We also hedge certain expenses as noted below. We hedge our net exposures using a four quarter rolling layered hedge program. As such, a portion of the projected euro, yen, and Australian dollar denominated net revenue for our fiscal 2013 has been hedged.
8
The closer to the current time period, the more we are hedged. See below for more details on our foreign currency hedging program.
Full Year Fiscal 2013
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share exclude $0.50 related to stock-based compensation expense, $0.14 related to restructuring charges, $0.26 for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles and $0.02 for loss on strategic investments, net of tax.
Both fourth quarter fiscal 2013 and full year fiscal 2013 outlooks assume annual effective tax rates of approximately 24.5 percent and 25.5 percent for GAAP and non-GAAP results, respectively. These rates do not include the federal R&D tax credit benefit, which expired on December 31, 2011, or one-time discrete items. The assumed effective tax rate will be adjusted if or when there is a renewal of the tax credit. 
Autodesks Foreign Currency Hedging Program and Calculation of Constant Currency Growth
Given the recent foreign exchange volatility, we would like to provide a brief summary of how we handle foreign currency exchange hedging as well as a description of how we calculate constant currency growth rates. A few points on our hedging program include:
When we report period-over-period growth rate percentages on a constant currency basis, we attempt to represent the changes in the underlying business operations by eliminating fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as eliminating hedge gains or losses recorded within the current
9
and comparative period. However, when we calculate the foreign currency impact of exchange rates in the current and comparative period on our financial results (See table in above Foreign Currency Impact section) we include the U.S. Dollar impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as the impact of gains and losses recorded as a result of our hedging program.
Autodesks Product Type Classification
The following represents Autodesks current view for product categorization. Autodesk will periodically make changes to this list. This is not a complete list.
  
Flagship includes the following products:
Suites include the following products classes:
New and Adjacent includes the following products and services:
