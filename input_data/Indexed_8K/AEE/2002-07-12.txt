LOUIS, MO, July 12, 2002--The regulatory law judge in AmerenUE's Missouri electric rate case today announced the suspension of public hearings that the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) convened July 11 in Jefferson City, Mo. These hearings were temporarily suspended until 8:30 a.m., Tuesday, July 16. Upon announcing this suspension, the regulatory law judge stated that the parties have reached "an agreement in principle" on the issues in the case. Over the next several days, the parties to the case will be in the process of preparing a formal written agreement that will be submitted to the MoPSC. No details on the agreement will be released until the parties collectively review, approve, and file that agreement with the MoPSC. Any agreement reached by the parties must ultimately be approved by the MoPSC. AmerenUE is a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Ameren Corporation. Ameren companies serve 1.5 million electric customers and 300,000 natural gas customers in a 44,500-square-mile area of Missouri and Illinois. Safe Harbor Statement Statements made in this release, which are not based on historical facts, are "forward-looking" and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. Although such "forward-looking" statements have been made in good faith and are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that the expected results will be achieved. These statements include (without limitation) statements as to future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions, and financial performance. In connection with the "Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Ameren is providing this cautionary statement to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this release and in Ameren's annual report on SEC Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001, and subsequent securities filings, could cause results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such "forward-looking" statements: o results of settlement negotiations with all pertinent parties in the pending AmerenUE excess earnings complaint case; and o decisions by the Missouri Public Service Commission and other regulatory actions. # # #
