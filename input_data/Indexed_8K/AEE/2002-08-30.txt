The waiting period applicable to the pending sale under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act will expire 30 days after substantial compliance with the Second Request, unless terminated earlier by the DOJ. Issuance of a Second Request is not unusual for transactions of this size, and the companies intend to cooperate fully and respond promptly. As previously announced, the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals by the Illinois Commerce Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Ameren on July 31, 2002, filed required notices with the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission to acquire CILCORP from AES. Ameren expects the sale of CILCORP to close in the first quarter of 2003, and under the stock purchase agreement with AES is obligated to resolve any issues raised by the DOJ in connection with its Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing. --more--
