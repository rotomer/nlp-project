Excluding unusual items, the company reported ongoing 2002 earnings of $440 million, or $3.01 per share ($3.00 diluted), compared to 2001 ongoing earnings of $476 million, or $3.46 per share ($3.45 diluted). The company's 2002 ongoing earnings per share was within the guidance for 2002 ongoing earnings of $3.00 to $3.10 per share provided in December 2002. The company recorded a net loss of $32 million, or 20 cents per share (20 cents diluted), for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to net earnings of $49 million, or 35 cents per share (34 cents diluted), for the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding unusual items, fourth quarter 2002 earnings were $26 million, or 18 cents per share (18 cents diluted). There were no unusual items in the fourth quarter of 2001. Net earnings in 2002 included an after-tax charge of $58 million, or 40 cents per share, related to a previously-announced voluntary retirement program and restructuring charges associated with the retirement of the company's Venice, Ill., plant and the temporary suspension of operation of two generating units at the company's Meredosia, Ill., plant. Earnings for 2001 included a one-time, after-tax charge of $7 million, or 5 cents per share, resulting from the required adoption of a new accounting standard related to derivative financial instruments in January 2001. "At Ameren, we have promised our stakeholders performance leadership by pursuing a consistent, long-term strategy that is focused on our core business of producing and delivering energy," said Charles W. Mueller, chairman and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. "In 2002, we continued to deliver on our promises. We entered into a constructive settlement of the largest rate case in our history, announced the acquisition of a high quality utility in CILCORP Inc., earned superior marks for customer service and environmental stewardship, and significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 and Dow Jones Utility indexes. We did this while maintaining a balance sheet and credit ratings that are among the best in our industry. - more - Add One
"This was accomplished in a year when many companies in our industry failed to deliver on their promises as the energy sector grappled with a weak economy, soft energy markets, highly leveraged balance sheets and a host of other issues," added Mr. Mueller. "In fact, a major credit rating agency referred to 2002 as the worst year for our industry since the Great Depression." Total electric revenues in 2002 were flat as compared to the prior year. Warmer summer weather drove higher cooling demand, but this benefit to revenues was partially offset by the impact of the weak economy on industrial sales and rate reductions associated with our Missouri electric rate case settlement. During 2002, weather-sensitive residential and commercial electric kilowatthour sales rose 7 percent and 2 percent, respectively, while industrial electric sales decreased approximately 5 percent. Lower interchange revenues and sales compared to the prior year were attributable to lower energy prices and less low-cost generation available for sale due primarily to the increased demand for power from native load customers. Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $70 million during 2002, compared to 2001. This increase was primarily due to higher employee medical and pension benefit expenses, increased plant maintenance expenses, and higher labor costs due to customary cost of living increases. Earnings were also reduced in 2002 by increased depreciation and financing costs associated with capital additions and the dilutive effect on earnings per share from new common stock issued during the year to reduce outstanding debt and prefund a portion of the CILCORP acquisition. That acquisition was completed on Jan. 31, 2003. The average number of shares outstanding in 2002 was 6 percent greater than in 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2002, net earnings benefited from increased heating demand relative to 2001, but were reduced by a refueling and maintenance outage at the company's Callaway Nuclear Plant. Fourth quarter earnings were reduced by 13 cents per share due to the Callaway outage. Consistent with the full year 2002 trends, net earnings in the fourth quarter were also lower than in 2001, due to the Missouri rate case settlement and increased employee benefit, depreciation and financing costs. "Looking to 2003, we continue to expect some of the challenges we experienced in 2002 to persist," said Gary L. Rainwater, president and chief operating officer of Ameren Corporation. "However, we have taken numerous prudent actions to significantly lower costs and benefit future operations. And we are very excited about the anticipated benefits associated with our recent acquisition of CILCORP, which we completed two months earlier than we expected. This acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in the first year and provide meaningful long-term growth opportunities for our company. At Ameren, we remain committed to efficiently producing and delivering reliable energy, maintaining our financial strength and flexibility and providing solid, long-term returns to our shareholders." -- more -- Add Two
The company also announced today that it reaffirmed its expectation that 2003 earnings will be in the range of $2.80 to $3.05 per share. The company's 2003 earnings range incorporates the expected earnings accretion from CILCORP and the issuance of 5.5 million shares of common stock in January to fund that acquisition. This estimate is subject to, among other things, weather, changing energy market and economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties outlined in the company's Safe Harbor Statement.
