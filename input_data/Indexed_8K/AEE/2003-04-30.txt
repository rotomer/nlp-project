Exhibit 99.1 [GRAPHIC OMITTED][GRAPHIC OMITTED] One Ameren Plaza 1901 Chouteau Avenue St. Louis, MO 63103 Contact: Media Analysts Investors Tim Fox Bruce Steinke Investor Services (314) 554-3120 (314) 554-2574 invest@ameren.com tfox2@ameren.com bsteinke@ameren.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- AMEREN REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS St. Louis, Mo., April 30, 2003---Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2003 first quarter net income of $101 million, or 63 cents per share, compared to net income of $59 million, or 42 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2002. The company recorded a net after-tax gain of $18 million, or 11 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2003, due to the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the recognition of asset retirement obligations. Excluding this item, the company reported ongoing 2003 first quarter net income of $83 million, or 52 cents per share. There were no unusual gains or losses in the first quarter of 2002. All per share earnings are basic and diluted. "A return to more normal weather, improved power prices in the energy markets and solid availability of our low cost electric generating plants boosted our ongoing earnings this quarter over the prior year period," said Charles W. Mueller, chairman and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. "Our strong first quarter earnings, coupled with the completion of the CILCORP acquisition ahead of our original schedule, put us on target to meet our goals for 2003." On Jan. 31, 2003, the company completed its acquisition of CILCORP Inc., including its utility subsidiary, Central Illinois Light Company, now operating as AmerenCILCO. Consequently, CILCORP's operating results for February and March 2003 are reflected in Ameren's financial statements for the first quarter of 2003. "Upon completion of the acquisition, we immediately began to formally integrate our operations," said Gary L. Rainwater, president and chief operating officer of Ameren. "The combination of our two companies is well underway, and we continue to expect the acquisition of CILCORP to be accretive to earnings per share in year one."
- more - Add One Electric revenues in the first quarter of 2003 increased $109 million, as compared to 2002. Electric revenues resulting from the acquisition of CILCORP ($80 million) and higher customer demand resulting from colder winter weather than last year's abnormally warm conditions sparked the increase. In the company's pre-CILCORP acquisition service area, weather-sensitive residential and commercial electric kilowatthour sales rose 14 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2003, as compared to 2002. These positive factors were partially offset by reduced sales of emission credits and a 4 percent decline in industrial electric kilowatthour sales in the company's pre-AmerenCILCO service territory. Earnings from interchange sales by AmerenEnergy, Inc. on behalf of AmerenUE and AmerenEnergy Generating Company increased net income in the first quarter of 2003 by approximately 16 cents per share. This increase in earnings was principally due to significantly higher power prices and greater availability of the company's low cost generating plants. Margins from the distribution and sale of natural gas improved $25 million, or 10 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2003, compared to the first quarter of 2002, due to the addition of AmerenCILCO and higher customer demand, resulting from colder weather in 2003. Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $37 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to 2002, due to the addition of AmerenCILCO and higher employee benefit costs. Earnings were also reduced in the first quarter of 2003 by increased depreciation and financing costs associated with the addition of AmerenCILCO and new capital additions, as well as by the dilutive effect on earnings per share of new common stock issued during the past year. In the first quarter of 2003, Ameren adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." For the company's regulated operations, the adoption of this standard resulted primarily in an increase in both assets and liabilities associated with legal obligations for the retirement of long-lived assets of more than $200 million. For the company's unregulated operations, adoption of this standard primarily resulted in removal costs accrued in the accumulated depreciation being eliminated and recognized as income to the extent no associated legal obligation was identified. The net impact on income was an after-tax gain of $18 million, or 11 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2003 upon adoption of the new accounting standard. - more -
Add Two Ameren also announced today that the company was reaffirming its 2003 guidance for earnings per share before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of between $2.80 and $3.05 per share. This estimate excludes the gain of 11 cents per share on the adoption of the new accounting standard and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, timely integration of AmerenCILCO, weather conditions, energy market and economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties outlined in the company's Forward-Looking Statements.

Forward-Looking Statements - -------------------------- Statements made in this release, which are not based on historical facts, are "forward-looking" and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. Although such "forward-looking" statements have been made in good faith and are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that the expected results will be achieved.

In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the company is providing this cautionary statement to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this release and in past and subsequent securities filings, could cause results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such "forward-looking" statements: o the effects of the stipulation and agreement relating to the AmerenUE Missouri electric excess earnings complaint case and other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory policy;
o changes in laws and other governmental actions, including monetary and fiscal policy; o the impact on the company of current regulations related to the opportunity for customers to choose alternative energy suppliers in Illinois; o the effects of increased competition in the future due to, among other things, deregulation of certain aspects of the company's business at both the state and federal levels; o the effects of participation in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-approved regional transmission organization, including activities associated with the Midwest Independent System Operator; o availability and future market prices for fuel for the production of electricity, such as coal and natural gas, purchased power, electricity and natural gas for distribution, including the use of financial and derivative instruments, the volatility of changes in market prices and the ability to recover increased costs; o average rates for electricity in the Midwest; o business and economic conditions; o the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards and the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance; o interest rates and the availability of capital; o actions of ratings agencies and the effects of such actions; o weather conditions; o generation plant construction, installation and performance; o operation of nuclear power facilities and decommissioning costs; o the effects of strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and divestitures; o the impact of current environmental regulations on utilities and generating companies and the expectation that more stringent requirements will be introduced over time, which could potentially have a negative financial effect; o future wages and employee benefits costs, including changes in returns on benefit plan assets; o disruptions of the capital markets or other events making the company's access to necessary capital more difficult or costly; o competition from other generating facilities, including new facilities that may be developed; o difficulties in integrating AmerenCILCO with the company's other businesses; o changes in the coal markets, environmental laws or regulations, or other factors adversely impacting synergy assumptions in connection with the CILCORP Inc. acquisition; o cost and availability of transmission capacity for the energy generated by the company's generating facilities or required to satisfy energy sales made by the company; and o legal and administrative proceedings. # # #
