Net income for the first six months of 2003 was $211 million, or $1.32 per share, compared to $174 million, or $1.22 per share, in the first half of 2002. The company recorded a net after-tax gain of $18 million, or 11 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2003, due to the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the recognition of asset retirement obligations. Excluding this item, the company reported net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the first six months of 2003 of $193 million, or $1.21 per share. All per share earnings are basic and diluted. "Our 2003 second quarter earnings were significantly impacted by very mild early summer weather, especially when compared to the hotter than normal weather conditions experienced in the second quarter of last year. As a result, our earnings were reduced by approximately 25 to 30 cents per share in the second quarter when compared to 2002," said Charles W. Mueller, chairman and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. "However, the greater availability of our low-cost generating plants, coupled with our continued focus on cost control, helped us deliver solid earnings for the quarter." Electric revenues in the second quarter of 2003 increased $38 million, as compared to 2002, principally due to the acquisition of CILCORP Inc. (including its utility subsidiary that is now operating as AmerenCILCO), which increased electric revenues by $124 million. The benefit of the acquisition of CILCORP on revenues was largely offset by reduced sales associated with mild weather. In the company's pre-acquisition service area, weather-sensitive - more -
Add One residential and commercial electric kilowatthour sales declined 17 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in the second quarter of 2003, as compared to the second quarter of 2002. Industrial electric kilowatthour sales increased almost 6 percent in the company's pre-acquisition service territory. Earnings from interchange sales by AmerenEnergy, Inc. on behalf of AmerenUE and AmerenEnergy Generating Company increased net income in the second quarter of 2003 by approximately 7 cents per share. This increase in earnings was principally due to higher power prices and greater availability of the company's low-cost generating plants. Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to 2002, principally due to the addition of AmerenCILCO. Partially offsetting the increased expenses related to AmerenCILCO were lower labor costs due to the voluntary retirement program instituted at Ameren at the end of 2002 and lower plant maintenance costs. Second quarter miscellaneous expenses were also lower in the second quarter of 2003 versus 2002 as a result of $26 million of costs that were expensed in the second quarter of 2002 for economic development and energy assistance programs included in a Missouri electric rate case settlement. Depreciation expense and financing costs increased in 2003 principally as a result of the addition of AmerenCILCO and new capital additions in the past year. The second quarter of 2003 was also the first full quarter of operations since the acquisition on Jan. 31, 2003 of CILCORP. "The integration of Ameren and AmerenCILCO operations is going very well," said Gary L. Rainwater, president and chief operating officer of Ameren. "This was clearly evident when our energy delivery personnel across the entire company tackled several severe storms in our service territory during the second quarter, restoring power to thousands of our customers in a safe and timely fashion. We continue to believe that all significant integration activities will be completed by the end of this year, and that the acquisition will be accretive to earnings in our first full year of operations." Ameren also announced today that the company was reaffirming its 2003 guidance for earnings per share, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, of between $2.80 and $3.05 per share. This estimate excludes the gain of 11 cents per share on the adoption of the new accounting standard, discussed above, and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, timely integration of AmerenCILCO, weather conditions, energy market and economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties outlined in the company's Forward-Looking Statements. - more -
