The net book value of the transferred assets was approximately $380 million as of June 30, 2003. Approximately 23% of AmerenCILCO's employees were transferred to AERG as a part of the transaction. Also on October 3, 2003, AERG entered into an electric power supply agreement with AmerenCILCO to supply it sufficient power to meet its native load requirements. This agreement expires December 31, 2004. AERG and AmerenCILCO plan to pursue an extension of the electric power supply agreement through December 31, 2006. The Illinois Commerce Commission authorized this extension in its order approving the Registrant's acquisition of AmerenCILCO.
