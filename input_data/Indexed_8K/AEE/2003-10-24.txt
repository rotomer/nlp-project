Net income in the third quarter of 2003 included an after-tax gain of $31 million, or 19 cents per share, related to the settlement of a dispute over certain mine reclamation issues with a coal supplier. Excluding this item, third quarter net income was $244 million, or $1.51 per share. Net income for the first nine months of 2003 was $486 million, or $3.02 per share, compared to $414 million, or $2.88 per share ($2.87 diluted), in the first nine months of 2002. The company recorded an after-tax gain of $18 million, or 11 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2003, due to the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the recognition of asset retirement obligations. Excluding the gains on the adoption of the new accounting standard and the coal mine reclamation settlement, net income for the first nine months of 2003 was $437 million, or $2.72 per share. "Once again, we delivered solid earnings in the third quarter of 2003 despite milder summer weather conditions," said Charles W. Mueller, chairman and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. "Our focus on asset optimization and cost control continues to reap benefits for all of our stakeholders." Gary L. Rainwater, president and chief operating officer of Ameren, added, "During the quarter, weather conditions were considerably cooler than in 2002, which reduced our earnings by 25 to 30 cents per share compared to last year. In addition, the second phase of electric rate reductions in our Missouri service territory reduced third quarter 2003 earnings by 5 cents per - more -
Add One share compared to the prior year. However, the good performance of the company's generating plants, higher power prices, lower expenses incurred in our pre-CILCORP acquisition operations and organic growth significantly offset the impact of weather and rate reductions." Electric revenues in the third quarter of 2003 increased $131 million, as compared to 2002. The acquisition of CILCORP Inc. (including its utility subsidiary that is now operating as AmerenCILCO), which increased electric revenues by $168 million, and higher interchange power revenues, which increased by $15 million, were the key factors behind the quarter's increased revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from native load customers due to cooler summer weather in 2003 compared to 2002, as well as an incremental annual electric rate decrease in our Missouri service territory of $30 million that went into effect in April 2003. In the company's pre-CILCORP acquisition service area, weather-sensitive residential and commercial electric kilowatthour sales declined 7 percent in the third quarter of 2003, as compared to the third quarter of 2002. However, industrial electric kilowatthour sales increased 1 percent in the company's pre-acquisition service territory. Earnings from interchange power sales by AmerenEnergy, Inc. on behalf of AmerenUE and AmerenEnergy Generating Company were 10 cents per share in the third quarter of 2003, up approximately 4 cents per share over the same period in 2002. This increase in earnings was due to higher power prices, greater availability of the company's low-cost generating plants and reduced demand from weather-sensitive native load customers. Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $24 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to 2002. Increased expenses due to the addition of CILCORP and rising employee benefit costs were partially offset by lower labor costs resulting from the voluntary retirement program implemented at Ameren in early 2003 and lower generating plant maintenance costs. Third quarter 2003 earnings per share were also unfavorably impacted compared to 2002 by higher depreciation expenses and financing costs, as well as a greater number of common shares outstanding. Commenting on the CILCORP acquisition, Rainwater added, "Our company remains very focused on the timely integration of AmerenCILCO, which continues to proceed on plan. In August, we completed the integration of Ameren and AmerenCILCO financial systems, and we expect the integration of operational systems to be completed by year-end." - more -
Add Two During the third quarter of 2003, the CILCORP acquisition was accretive to earnings by approximately 2 cents per share, consistent with the company's expectations. The company believes the CILCORP acquisition will be accretive to earnings in its first full year of operations, assuming normal weather conditions. Ameren also announced today that it was narrowing its 2003 earnings guidance range to between $2.90 and $3.00 per share, within its original 2003 range of $2.80 to $3.05 per share. This estimate excludes the gains, discussed above, of 11 cents per share related to the adoption of the new accounting standard and 19 cents per share for the coal mine reclamation settlement. The company's guidance is subject to, among other things, plant operations, timely integration of AmerenCILCO, weather conditions, energy market and economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties outlined in the company's Forward-Looking Statements.
