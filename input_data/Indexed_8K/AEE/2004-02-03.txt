The steps involved in the preceding sentence shall include agreeing to such limitations on conduct or actions as may be required in order to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Authorities (including those listed on Schedule 8.1(b) and 8.2(b)) necessary or advisable to obtain for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably possible, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing Date, and defending through litigation on the merits, including appeals, any claim asserted in any court by any party. (iii) Purchaser shall make the commitments reflected on Schedule 5.3(b) in the application to ICC. (c) Exceptions. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be required to take any action or actions that individually or together with all other actions would (A) have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operation (1) of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, or (2) of the Business after Closing, (B) result in a change to IPC's deferred tax balances or rate base valuation or accounting entries other than as provided on Schedule 8.2(b), Item I (iv), (C) result in recovery of less than the portion of Purchaser's costs of accomplishing IPC's reorganization determined for recovery in accordance with Schedule 8.2(b), Item I(V), (D) subject IPC to any dividend restriction other than that set forth on Schedule 8.2(b), Item I (vi), (E) result in the operation by IPC without the rider identified on Schedule 8.2(b), Item I (vii), if such operation without such rider would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operation (1) of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, or (2) of the Business after Closing, or (F) otherwise change the terms of the regulatory approvals described in Schedule 8.2(b), Items I (iv)-(vi), in a manner adverse to Purchaser or the IPC Companies. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Dynegy nor the Seller and their respective Affiliates shall be required to take any action or actions that individually or together with all other actions would (A) have a Material Adverse Effect prior to the Closing or a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operation of DMG, or on the business of selling capacity and energy products from or in respect of DMG's existing generation assets, (B) result in a change to the terms of the PPA that is adverse to DYPM, or (C) result in Seller or any of its Affiliates making any payment or having any continuing obligation pursuant to or otherwise in respect of the Intercompany Note or making any additional capital contribution to any of the IPC 44
Companies or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates as a condition to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. (d) Within 90 days of the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall cause IPC to and IPC shall undertake all necessary steps to submit a conditional membership application to accomplish the transfer of functional control of IPC's transmission facilities to the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. ("MISO"), provided that such transfer shall be conditioned in all respects on the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to occur at Closing. In accordance herewith, the joint application of the parties to the FERC provided for in Section 5.3(e) hereof shall also include an application seeking all necessary approvals under the FPA to transfer functional control of such facilities to the MISO. (e) Responsibilities. Purchaser shall, in coordination with Seller, have primary responsibility for the preparation of any applications with or notifications to the FERC with respect to the FERC approvals described on Schedules 8.1(b) and 8.2(b), and Seller and Purchaser shall jointly file any such applications or notifications. Purchaser shall have primary responsibility for the preparation and filing of any applications with or notifications to the SEC under PUHCA. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have primary responsibility for the preparation and filing of any applications or notifications to the ICC. Each of Purchaser and Dynegy shall be responsible for its filings with the FTC and/or the DOJ. Each party hereto shall have the right to review and approve in advance all such necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, testimony, exhibits, responses to discovery requests or other documents made or prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Section 5.4 Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing, each party shall, promptly after obtaining Knowledge of the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of any condition, event, circumstance, change, occurrence or state of facts arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would result in a material breach of any such representation or warranty or covenant of this Agreement of such party, give written notice thereof to the other parties and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to remedy promptly such breach; provided, however, that the delivery of, or failure to deliver, any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder, including the rights to indemnification under Article IX (other than to the extent set forth in Section 8.3). Section 5.5 Insurance; Risk of Loss. (a) Dynegy and Seller shall keep, or cause to keep, all insurance policies that provide coverage for any IPC Companies, the Business or any IPC Assets, as the case may be, in full force and effect through the Closing, or provide for the renewal of all such policies that are expiring by their own terms prior to such date. In the event of a property loss in respect of any asset of the Business, the IPC Assets or IPC Companies prior to the Closing, Seller and Dynegy agree to cede recovered insurance proceeds (net of deductible) in respect of such asset to Purchaser post-Closing for the repair of such asset. Except for the coverage required under Section 5.5(c), as of the Closing, Dynegy and Seller shall cause the termination of all insurance coverage for the Business, the IPC Assets or the IPC Companies and their respective businesses, assets, and current or former employees, and Purchaser shall become solely 46
responsible for all insurance coverage and related risk of loss based on events occurring after the Closing with respect to the IPC Companies, the Business, the IPC Assets, and their respective businesses, assets, and current and former employees; provided, however, that (i) no such termination by Dynegy or Seller of any "occurrence" coverage in force prior to the Closing shall be effected so as to prevent Purchaser or any IPC Company from recovering under such coverage for losses from events or damages occurring prior to the Closing; and (ii) no such termination of any "claims-made" coverage in force prior to the Closing shall be effected so as to prevent Purchaser or any IPC Company from recovering under such coverage for losses from events or damages occurring prior to the Closing to the extent the applicable insurance company or third party claims administrator shall have received written notice of claims or written notice of circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to a claim that occurred relating to such events on or before or within 60 days after the Closing. Dynegy and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to report to the applicable insurance company or third party claims administrator, on a timely basis before the Closing, any claims of which they have Knowledge (or circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to a claim) relating to events occurring prior to the Closing. (b) For all insurance and/or self-insurance claims of the Business, the IPC Assets or the IPC Companies filed prior to the Closing, and for those claims of the Business, the IPC Assets or the IPC Companies identified as set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), upon the consummation of the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for any and all costs related to any such claims, including deductibles, self-insured retentions, claims adjusting expenses, loss conversion factor expenses, retroactive premium adjustments, audits, collateral requirements and associated costs, uninsured losses, security deposits, legal fees, indemnity benefits and any other costs that become due and payable in connection with any such claims. Purchaser shall reimburse Dynegy for these costs by wire transfer of funds within twenty days of receipt of an invoice from Dynegy therefore, accompanied by reasonable supporting detail. (c) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, Seller and Dynegy shall maintain, at their expense, directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability policies which provide coverage on terms as commercially reasonably similar to the terms of such current insurance coverage. If Seller fails to maintain such coverage or has a change in control, then Seller must purchase run-off coverage, which will provide coverage in scope and amount commercially reasonably similar to those maintained prior to the Closing Date. The expiration date of such run-off policy shall be three years from the Closing Date. (d) To the extent that, after the Closing Date, Purchaser or Seller or any Affiliate thereof requires any information regarding claim data or other information pertaining to the Business, the IPC Assets or the IPC Companies in order to make filings with insurance carriers or administer or manage a claim, upon request, Dynegy and Seller shall promptly supply such information to Purchaser or Purchaser shall or shall cause the applicable IPC Company promptly to supply such information to Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller, as the case may be. To the extent that Purchaser will require the utilization of the claims data maintained by an insurance company, Purchaser agrees to assume sole responsibility for obtaining a subscription from any insurance company to obtain such claims information and the related costs associated with any such service. 46
(e) The provisions of this Section 5.5 shall not apply to any insurance policies that provide funding for any Employee Benefit Plan or employee Compensation Arrangement. Section 5.6 Confidentiality. (a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided or to be provided to it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference; provided, however, that the parties hereby agree that as of the Closing Date the term of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be hereby amended to be the later of (i) two years from the Closing Date and (ii) three years from the date hereof; provided, further, however, that after the Closing, Purchaser, its Affiliates and the IPC Companies may use or disclose any confidential information related to any IPC Company, the IPC Assets or the Business. (b) Dynegy agrees that for a period of two years after the Closing, it and its Affiliates will not use or disclose, and Dynegy will use its commercially reasonable efforts and will cause its Affiliates and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, agents and representatives not to use or disclose to any party other than Purchaser or any of its Affiliates any confidential information relating to the IPC Assets, the Business or any IPC Company. The obligation to keep such information confidential does not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of an unauthorized disclosure by Dynegy, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective directors, employees, agents or representatives, or (ii) is required by applicable Law or applicable Tax, accounting or SEC disclosure obligations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system to be disclosed, but only to the extent required to be disclosed. Section 5.7 Intercompany Arrangements. Except as listed on Schedule 5.7: (a) all receivables or payables of any IPC Company, on the one hand, from or to, as applicable, Dynegy or any of its Affiliates (other than any IPC Company), on the other hand, shall be settled as of the Closing; and (b) all contracts or other arrangements existing immediately prior to the Closing between any IPC Company, on the one hand, and Dynegy or any of its Affiliates (other than any IPC Company), on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing, except as specifically provided in Section 5.5; provided, however, that Items 1 and 2 on Schedule 5.7 shall be terminated as of the later of the Closing Date or December 31, 2004. Section 5.8 Use of Dynegy and Seller's Names. Prior to the Closing, Seller may cause the IPC Companies to remove any right, title or interest in any logo, trade name, trademark, service mark, house mark, domain name, web site or company name to the extent it contains or consists of the "Dynegy" name or the "Dynegy" emblem or any other mark in which one or the other of these elements appear. Purchaser will use reasonable efforts to cause the IPC Companies to remove all such items described in the preceding sentence from the IPC Assets within 60 days after the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, Purchaser will not and will cause each IPC Company not to use such items. 47
Section 5.9 Change of Control Offer. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause IPC to comply with the change of control redemption offer provisions of the Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 20, 2002 to the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of November 1, 1992 for the 11 1/2% bonds due 2010. Section 5.10 Further Assurances. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, from time to time following the Closing, each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby. Section 5.11 No Public Announcement. None of Purchaser, Dynegy or Seller shall (nor shall Seller permit any of the IPC Companies to) and each of them shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their Affiliates and each of its and their respective representatives, directors, officers and agents not to, without the approval of the other, make any press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so obligated by applicable Law, applicable accounting and SEC disclosure obligations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system, in which case the other parties shall be advised and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary in connection with regulatory filings and interactions with Governmental Authorities (and members thereto and employees thereof) to implement the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Section 5.12 Access to Records. (a) To facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or incurred by Dynegy or its Affiliates prior to the Closing or for any other reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years after the Closing Date, Dynegy and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records of the IPC Companies relating to periods prior to the Closing (including books and records relating to the IPC Assets and the Business); provided that (i) in the case of books and records relating to Taxes, the covenant shall be for a period of time equal to the relevant statute of limitations with respect to such Taxes, including any extensions thereof, and (ii) with respect to items referred to in Sections 9.1(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i), the covenant shall be in force during the pendency of any Action or threatened Action related to such items. Such access shall be afforded by Purchaser upon receipt of reasonable advance written notice and during normal business hours. Dynegy shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 5.12(a). If Purchaser shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such seven-year period, Purchaser shall, prior to such disposition, give Dynegy a reasonable opportunity, at Dynegy's expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Dynegy may select. (b) To facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or incurred by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing or for any other reasonable purpose, for a pe- 48
riod of seven years after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records relating to the IPC Companies (including books and records relating to the IPC Assets and the Business) which Dynegy or any of its Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date; provided that, in the case of books and records relating to Taxes, the covenant shall be for a period of time equal to the relevant statute of limitations with respect to such Taxes, including any extensions thereof. Such access shall be afforded by Dynegy and its Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance written notice and during normal business hours. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 5.12(b). If Dynegy or any of its Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such seven-year period, Dynegy shall, prior to such disposition, give Purchaser a reasonable opportunity, at Purchaser's expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Purchaser may select. Section 5.13 No Solicitation. From the date hereof through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date, Dynegy and Seller shall not, and Dynegy shall not permit its Subsidiaries, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any officers, directors, employees, financial advisors and other agents or representatives of Dynegy or its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing any non-public information concerning the IPC Companies or their assets) inquiries or proposals, or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Purchaser and its agents and representatives), concerning a Potential Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Potential Transaction" shall mean a possible acquisition of the Business, whether by merger or by the acquisition of the stock or substantially all the assets of Seller or IPC. Section 5.14 Terminated Employees. On the Closing Date, Dynegy shall provide Purchaser with a list that sets forth the number of full and part time employees of any IPC Companies involuntarily terminated, and whether or not such termination was for cause, during the period beginning 90 days prior to the Closing Date. Section 5.15 Intercompany Note. At or within two days prior to the Closing, the parties will take the actions set forth on Schedule 5.15 with respect to the Intercompany Note. Section 5.16 Covenant Not to Sue. (a) Each of Dynegy and Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their respective successors not to, directly or indirectly, sue any Purchaser Group Member with regard to any Generation Liabilities, and shall release and forever discharge all Purchaser Group Members from such Generation Liabilities. (b) Each of Dynegy and Seller shall not, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates and each of their respective successors not to, directly or indirectly, argue, assert, claim, agree or bring any Action or enter into any settlement that alleges or stipulates that any Purchaser Group Member is or should be responsible, liable or obligated to take or not to take any action, make any payment, incur any expense, with respect to any liabilities, com- 49
mitments, or obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates or in connection with the Generation Liabilities. Section 5.17 IPC Property. At least 120 days prior to Dynegy's good faith estimate of the Closing Date, Dynegy and Seller shall and shall cause their Affiliates to make available to Purchaser, for inspection or copying by Purchaser at Purchaser's expense (but only to the extent that such documents or materials are in the possession or control of Dynegy, Seller, or any of their Affiliates) existing documents containing (i) the legal descriptions of the IPC Owned Real Property and the material Leased Real Properties, and (ii) lists or summaries of all other IPC Properties (together with legal descriptions thereof), together with copies of any easement, license, right of way, use or similar agreements, and any other title documents relating to the IPC Other Real Property. Dynegy and Seller shall cooperate reasonably, and shall cause IPC to cooperate reasonably and to execute such customary affidavits and documents (with such modifications as may be necessary for factual accuracy), as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser's title insurance company, prior to the Closing Date in connection with any title insurance coverage reasonably obtained by Purchaser at Closing; provided that neither Dynegy nor Seller (nor any of their Affiliates, other than IPC) nor any of the officers or employees of Seller or of Dynegy (or of any of their Affiliates, including IPC) shall be required to incur any cost or liability in connection with the acquisition by Purchaser of title insurance at the Closing or any affidavits or other instruments required by Purchaser's title company as a condition to issuing such title insurance at the Closing, it being understood that any such title affidavits or documents shall be provided solely by IPC and any costs associated with such title insurance (and any title endorsements and other documents or instruments required in connection with Purchaser's title insurance) shall be borne solely by Purchaser. Section 5.18 Remediation of Excluded Environmental Matters. (a) After the Closing, if (x) Purchaser reasonably determines that Remediation of a Hazardous Substance should be performed in response to (i) a requirement of an Environmental Law; (ii) a Governmental Order from a Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the applicable Excluded Environmental Matters; (iii) a reasonable claim or demand by a third party made in connection with an Environmental Law or Excluded Environmental Matters or liability under the common law for the actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Substances; or (iv) the presence or Release of a Hazardous Substance in excess of an applicable and relevant standard in an Environmental Law which necessitates Remediation under such Environmental Law, and (y) such Remediation relates to the Business or IPC Assets as they existed immediately prior to the Closing, then Purchaser shall implement the required Remediation. In such event, Purchaser shall notify Dynegy at least twenty (20) Business Days, or as soon as reasonably possible if prompt Remediation is legally required or advisable under this Section 5.18, in advance of commencing such Remediation and shall request authorization from Dynegy to perform or cause one of its Affiliates to perform the Remediation; provided, however, if Purchaser is required by a Governmental Authority with jurisdiction to immediately take remedial action, Purchaser shall proceed as required and notify Dynegy as soon as practicable thereafter of its action and provide the other information required by this Section 5.18. Purchaser's notice to Dynegy shall include a reasonably detailed description of the Remediation to be performed and a detailed cost estimate for such 50
Remediation. Upon Purchaser's receipt of Dynegy's written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to perform (or cause one of its Affiliates to perform) the Remediation, Purchaser shall commence the Remediation in accordance with the Remediation plan. Except for claims treated in the last sentence of Section 9.5(a), Dynegy shall reimburse Purchaser or such Affiliate of Purchaser for all cost and expenses incurred in connection with such Remediation within 30 days of Purchaser or such Affiliate submitting an invoice therefor to Dynegy; provided, however, that Purchaser may, at its discretion, submit invoices either periodically or at the completion of Remediation and Dynegy shall reimburse Purchaser or such Affiliate for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Remediation within 30 days of receiving such invoice. Purchaser shall promptly notify Dynegy of any material changes in the Remediation plan or costs and obtain approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, for such changes. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Section 5.18(a), after Purchaser receives written notice from a Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over Remediation performed at a site by Purchaser under this Section that such Remediation has been completed and/or that no further Remediation is needed at that time, Purchaser shall perform no further Remediation at the site unless subsequently required to do so in accordance with the terms of such notice or a new event subject to Sections 5.18(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv). Dynegy, Seller or any Affiliate thereof may request that a Governmental Authority issue such notice. (b) In the event that Purchaser chooses to develop, or cause any IPC Company to develop, any IPC Assets for a use other than the transmission, distribution and sale of electrical energy and natural gas or substantially similar industrial purposes, Dynegy shall not become responsible under this Section 5.18 for Remediation costs that, due to the changed use, are higher than the Remediation costs would be if such IPC Assets continued to be used for transmission, distribution and sale of electrical energy and natural gas or substantially similar industrial purposes. Accordingly, if such IPC Assets, or any portion thereof, ceases to be used for transmission, distribution and sale of electrical energy and natural gas or substantially similar industrial purposes (including repowering or development for such purposes), and if due to such changed use, the costs of Remediation relating to Excluded Environmental Matters are higher than the cost of Remediation would be if such IPC Assets (in their entirety) had continued to be used for transmission, distribution and sale of electrical energy and natural gas or substantially similar industrial purposes, except for claims treated in the last sentence of Section 9.5(a), Dynegy shall be responsible only for the costs of Remediation that Purchaser would have incurred if such IPC Assets were being used for transmission, distribution and sale of electrical energy and natural gas or substantially similar industrial purposes. (c) If IPC, individually or collectively with DMG, shall be required, after the Closing prior to December 31, 2010, pursuant to either (i) a final, non-appealable Governmental Order in full force and effect entered by a court with proper jurisdiction over IPC or issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or (ii) a legally binding, non-appealable consent decree or administrative order or other settlement in full force and effect with all required approvals of applicable Governmental Authorities entered into by (x) DMG and IPC or (y) IPC (with the approval of Dynegy pursuant to Section 9.3) regarding, in each such case, any Clean Air Act Litigation (each of such Governmental Order, consent decree or other settlement, a "Mandate") to implement or pay for implementation of Best Available Control Tech- 51 nology ("BACT"), or any other emission limitation requiring installation of pollution control devices, measures or technologies on any plant that is a Generation Asset due to any alleged violation of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 7401 et seq. (such liability, the "BACT Liability"), AND (A) DMG, to the extent it is subject to the Mandate, fails to perform in any material respect in accordance with the terms of any such Mandate (it being understood that this clause (A) does not apply if IPC is individually or collectively with DMG subject to the Mandate), AND (B) the Governmental Authority that issued or agreed to such Mandate, or a party to such Mandate, as the case may be, seeks a remedy to enforce IPC's compliance with the terms of the Mandate due to the failure of IPC or DMG, as the case may be, to have performed the obligations under such Mandate, AND (C) Purchaser has demanded in writing that the Seller Indemnitors comply with their indemnification obligations pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of Article IX with respect to IPC's Indemnifiable Losses due to the Mandate, AND (D) the Seller Indemnitors collectively fail to comply in any material respect with such indemnification obligations then due within ten days of the Seller Indemnitors' receipt of such demand, AND (E) the Escrowed Funds in the Escrow Account shall have been exhausted, then Dynegy shall cause DMG to, promptly following receipt of a notice from IPC that the foregoing events described in clauses (A)-(E) have occurred and are continuing, take such action or actions as may be reasonably necessary, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, to cause the affected Generation Asset to become in compliance with the Mandate, including, to the extent required for such compliance, (x) by reducing the generation output of such Generation Asset or (y) by effecting the shutdown in whole or in part of such Generation Asset. The parties specifically agree that the provisions contained in Section 11.16 are applicable to the obligations provided for in this Section 5.18(c). For purposes of this Section 5.18(c): "Clean Air Act Litigation" means the Baldwin Litigation and any Other Claim, as such terms are defined in the Escrow Agreement; and "Best Available Control Technology" shall have the meaning as set forth at Section 169(3) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 7479. Section 5.19 Consent Solicitation. At Purchaser's request, Seller shall cause IPC to commence a solicitation of consents from the holders of IPC's 11 1/2 % bonds due 2010 to effect amendments to the indenture pursuant to which such bonds were issued. Such amendments will be designated by Purchaser with Seller's consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Such solicitation shall expire on the Closing Date, and any amendments for which approval is obtained shall be effective only if the Closing occurs. Any out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by IPC in connection with such consent solicitation, including any consent payments to bondholders that are approved by Purchaser, 52
shall be reimbursed by Purchaser promptly after receiving invoices therefor from IPC. The successful completion of the consent solicitation is not a condition to the Closing. Section 5.20 Generation Asset Transfers. (a) The parties shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to identify all assets (i) transferred pursuant to any Asset Transfer Agreements or to be transferred under the Generation Agreement that are not used in the generation operations of DMG and are used in connection with the Business and (ii) owned by any IPC Company, not used in connection with the Business and necessary for the operation by DMG of its generation business. (b) Following the Closing, Dynegy shall cause DMG to transfer to IPC the assets identified by Dynegy and Purchaser pursuant to clause (i) of Section 5.20(a), pursuant to the Generation Agreement. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause IPC to transfer to DMG the assets identified by Dynegy and Purchaser pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 5.20(a) pursuant to the Generation Agreement. In connection with such transfers pursuant to this Section 5.20(b), Dynegy shall and shall cause IPC and their respective Affiliates to, in consultation with Purchaser, make all necessary filings with and obtain all necessary appraisals and governmental orders from the applicable Governmental Authorities. Section 5.21 Certain Additional Agreements. (a) At least 60 days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall advise Seller whether transitional services will be required by Purchaser from and after the Closing Date and which such services will be required. In such event, Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith the schedules of services to be provided, the length of time for such services (which shall in no event exceed 90 days) and the rates at which such services will be provided to Purchaser, which rates will be at fair market value. Any transition services agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 5.21 is referred to as the "Transition Services Agreement". Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the execution of a Transition Services Agreement shall not be a condition to the Closing for any party. Dynegy, the IPC Companies and Purchaser will cooperate during the period prior to Closing to minimize, to the extent reasonably practicable, the need for the IPC Companies to rely on transitional services after the Closing. (b) Dynegy shall cause DMG (and any applicable Affiliate of DMG that owns or has rights to real property subject to such Agreement) to execute an Easement and Facilities Agreement (the "Easement and Facilities Agreement"), as grantor, granting valid, enforceable and insurable easement in recordable form over the real property Generation Assets to IPC, and including the terms set forth on Exhibit E. Dynegy and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to finalize the Easement and Facilities Agreement within 30 days after the date hereof and otherwise in form and substance mutually satisfactory to the parties. Prior to the Closing (and, if applicable, subsequent to the Closing), the Dynegy Parties shall use good faith, reasonable efforts (including causing DMG or any other Affiliate of DMG that owns or has rights to the Generation Assets) to request and obtain an agreement (each, a "Subordination Agreement"), in recordable form and otherwise in customary form, from each mortgagee 53
(which term, as used in this Section 5.21(b), shall include the grantee or beneficiary under a deed of trust) holding a mortgage (which term as used herein shall include a deed of trust) encumbering the Generation Assets, which Subordination Agreement shall provide for subordination of such mortgage to the Easement and Facilities Agreement. The proposed form of Subordination Agreement provided by Dynegy (or its Affiliate) to each mortgagee, and any modifications to such form, shall be subject to the approval of Dynegy and Purchaser (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Dynegy shall keep Purchaser advised of the status of material responses from or communications with such mortgagees (and provide copies of drafts of the Subordination Agreement sent to or by any such mortgagee or its counsel). Dynegy shall promptly (i) make available to Purchaser copies of any mortgages encumbering the Generation Assets, (ii) provide Purchaser with a copy of any executed Subordination Agreement obtained from a mortgagee, (iii) cause any such executed Subordination Agreement to be recorded in the applicable local real estate recording office, and (iv) provide Purchaser with evidence of such recordation; provided, however, that any legal fees of the mortgagees and the cost of title endorsements required by the mortgagees related to the Subordination Agreement shall be shared equally by Purchaser and the Dynegy Parties Prior to the date that Dynegy shall have obtained an executed Subordination Agreement from a mortgagee (or in the event that any mortgagee refuses to execute a Subordination Agreement following good faith, reasonable efforts by the Dynegy Parties to obtain one), Dynegy shall give Purchaser prompt written notice of any acceleration of the applicable mortgage and any action subsequent thereto by such mortgagee to enforce the mortgage. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the receipt of an executed Subordination Agreement from any mortgagee shall not be a condition to Purchaser's obligation to close hereunder. This Section 5.21(b) shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.21(b) shall require any of the Dynegy Parties or their Affiliates to take, or refrain from taking, any action that could reasonably constitute a breach or default under the terms of any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for borrowed money, or to require any of the Dynegy Parties or their Affiliates to pay any fees (other than its share of the legal fees of the mortgagees and the cost of title endorsements required by the mortgagees as provided above in this Section) to any trustee, issuer, holder, lender, secured party or other Person under any such mortgage, indenture or instrument, or commence any solicitation in order to carry out or meet the obligations in this Section. (c) Seller shall cause IPC to allow the AmerGen Power Supply Agreement to expire in accordance with its terms as of December 31, 2004. Seller shall cause IPC to enter into one or more agreements for the purchase of 700 MW of firm capacity and energy during calendar years 2005 and 2006 (the "Base Energy Contracts") for which any necessary regulatory approvals shall have been obtained. In particular, the Base Energy Contracts will have the following characteristics: (i) the aggregate amount of firm capacity and energy guaranteed to IPC under the Base Energy Contracts shall be (1) 400 MW provided 24-hours per day, each day of the year, and (2) 300 MW provided between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. (prevailing time in Decatur, Illinois) each Business Day (as such term is defined in the PPA), and shall satisfy MAIN Guides and MISO capacity resource requirements for obtaining network integration transmission service under the applicable OATT and 54
for accreditation by the applicable NERC regional reliability council or successor organizations; (ii) IPC shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain financial transmission rights associated with the energy provided under the Base Energy Contracts, including but not limited to nominating the transmission of such energy to the IPC system in the MISO process for financial transmission right allocation, and, further, IPC shall not sell, divest, transfer or otherwise dispose of such rights; (iii) the Base Energy Contracts shall have a term of January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006; (iv) the Base Energy Contracts shall have been solicited through an independently administered competitive bidding process in which at least one party unaffiliated with Dynegy submitted an offer, and IPC shall have obtained the prior written consent of Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) with respect to the choice of the independent administrator, whose fees and expenses shall be reimbursed by Purchaser within five Business Days of IPC's request; (v) the Base Energy Contracts shall have been awarded to the bidder submitting the most favorable bid to IPC, taking into account price, credit worthiness, certainty of performance and other customary and commercially reasonable criteria; and (vi) the Base Energy Contracts shall provide for the payment of actual or liquidated damages in the event of any failure to deliver the capacity or energy as specified in clause (i) above. (d) Dynegy shall, and shall cause each Dynegy Subsidiary (other than any IPC Company) to execute and deliver to the counterparties thereto immediately following the Closing counterparts of each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party. Purchaser shall cause IPC to execute and deliver to the counterparties thereto immediately following the Closing counterparts of each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party. The parties specifically agree that the provisions contained in Section 11.16 are applicable to the obligations provided for in this Section 5.21(d). (e) The parties shall agree to such changes to the Blackstart Agreement and the Easement and Facilities Agreement as may be required by any Governmental Authority in order to obtain all necessary Final Orders for the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. (f) None of the Dynegy Parties will, and Seller will cause IPC not to, enter into any consent decree or other settlement with regard to Clean Air Act Litigation (as defined in Section 5.18) for which IPC has direct or contingent responsibility unless such consent decree or other settlement contains a release of IPC, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, from all such responsibility; provided, however, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary (including Section 9.3), that such release shall not be required in the case of any consent decree or other settlement relating to the Baldwin Litiga- 55
tion if (1) the amount of liability for which IPC has direct or contingent liability is not greater than, in the case of a consent decree or other settlement entered into prior to the Closing, $100,000,000 or, in the case of a consent decree or other settlement entered into following the Closing, the amount of Escrow Funds held as of the date of such consent decree or other settlement under the Escrow Agreement and (2) any performance required of IPC, directly or contingently, under such consent decree or other settlement is required to be completed by December 31, 2010. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall not permit IPC to enter into any consent decree or other settlement with regard to Clean Air Act Litigation that provides for IPC liability unless DMG has joint and several liability with IPC. (g) No later than June 30, 2004, IPC shall file with ICC revised gas service tariffs proposing a general increase in base rates for gas service. IPC shall retain (subject to the consent of Purchaser, such consent not be unreasonably withheld) qualified consultants, and, if it desires, outside counsel, to assist in the preparation and prosecution of the filing. At Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amounts paid or to be paid by IPC for the work of such qualified consultants and outside counsel on the filing through Closing. (h) Dynegy agrees to cause DMG and IPC to provide cooperation to Purchaser as reasonably requested by Purchaser in any effort to obtain insurance policies providing coverage for Clean Air Act Litigation liabilities, to the extent such cooperation would not result in the loss of a legal privilege or protection for Dynegy, DMG and IPC, or the actual or potential loss, compromise, or limitation of any defense, claim, position or strategy. All information obtained by Purchaser as a result of such cooperation shall be subject to any joint defense agreement entered into by Dynegy and Purchaser. Purchaser will reimburse Dynegy for out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by DMG and/or IPC in providing such cooperation to Purchaser. Section 5.22 Status Meetings. In furtherance of the covenants set forth in this Agreement, representatives of each of Dynegy, IPC and Purchaser shall meet: (a) no less frequently than once each week, in person or by conference telephone: (i) to discuss all filings with Governmental Authorities made or to be made in connection herewith and undertakings, terms and conditions relating thereto; (ii) to discuss costs incurred or committed to be incurred, concessions made, undertakings required and other actions or tasks relating to the approvals and consents required hereunder; and (iii) to discuss regulatory and legislative plans and strategies; and (b) subject to applicable Law, upon the request of Dynegy or Purchaser for a meeting (for which reasonable advance notice will be provided), either in person or by conference telephone, to discuss (i) financial results (including budget to actual analysis); (ii) capital project progress; (iii) actions to be taken or not to be taken or considered in current or potential regulatory proceedings; (iv) integration coordination; and (v) actions to be taken or not to be taken or considered in furtherance of the provisions of this Agreement. Section 5.23 PPA Modification Right. (a) By notice dated not later than September 1, 2004, Purchaser may, at its sole option and discretion (in accordance with the terms of the PPA), reduce the amount of Tier 1 Capac- 56
ity specified in Appendix 1 of the PPA for all months in calendar year 2005 by up to 200 MW, provided that the IP Load, as defined and calculated in the PPA, shall have been reduced as a result of retail customers of IPC switching electricity suppliers or terminating business operations. In the event IPC releases capacity in calendar year 2005 pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.23(a), such release shall apply in the same amount for calendar year 2006. Any written notice of Released Capacity (as defined in the PPA) shall include reasonable proof of the net reduction in IP Load, and the amount of Released Capacity shall not be greater than the amount of the net reduction in IP Load. (b) By notice dated not later than September 1, 2005, Purchaser may, at its sole option and discretion (in accordance with the terms of the PPA), reduce the amount of Tier 1 Capacity specified in Appendix 1 of the PPA for all months in calendar year 2006 by an amount not to exceed the difference between 200 MW and the amount of capacity released, if any, pursuant to Purchaser's election under Section 5.23(a), provided that the IP Load, as defined and calculated in the PPA, shall have been reduced as a result of retail customers of IPC switching electricity suppliers or terminating business operations. Any written notice of Released Capacity (as defined in the PPA) shall include reasonable proof of the net reduction in IP Load, and the amount of Released Capacity shall not be greater than the amount of the net reduction in IP Load. (c) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, no election by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.23 shall serve as a basis for assertion that a condition to the Closing has not been satisfied or for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1. Section 5.24 Compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the month following each calendar quarter, Dynegy shall provide Purchaser with status update on any assessment required of IPC, in its capacity as a Subsidiary of Dynegy, through the Closing in accordance with the items detailed in Schedule 5.24 to satisfy, in all material respects, the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and Dynegy shall make available to Purchaser (and Purchaser's outside advisers) the documentation supporting the implementation of such assessment, and will permit IPC to retain copies of any such documentation. Dynegy shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause IPC to complete such assessment by September 30, 2004. Purchaser acknowledges that Dynegy's external auditors will not make any assessment with respect to the performance of the obligations contained in this Section 5.24. Section 5.25 Litigation and Clinton Nuclear Power Station Updates. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall give Purchaser monthly notice of newly filed litigation in which any IPC Company is named as a defendant, as well as of any event that would have been required to be disclosed in Schedule 3.27 if such event had occurred prior to the date of this Agreement. ARTICLE VI EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS Section 6.1 Employment of Transferred Employees. 57
(a) The employment with the IPC Companies of each individual who is an Active Employee as of the Closing Date shall continue immediately after the Closing, and each such individual shall be referred to in this Agreement as a "Transferred Employee." In the case of Active Employees who are members of the "non-supervisory workforce" of the IPC Companies, within the meaning of 220 Illinois Code 5/16-128(c), such continued employment shall be at no less than the wage rates, and substantially equivalent fringe benefits and terms and conditions of employment as those that are in effect on the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall continue such wage rates and substantially equivalent fringe benefits and terms and conditions of employment for at least 30 months following the Closing Date, unless Purchaser and the collective bargaining units representing such non-supervisory Active Employees mutually agree to different terms and conditions of employment within such 30-month period. The preceding sentence is intended to satisfy the requirements of 220 Illinois Code 5/16-128(c), shall be construed in accordance with 220 Illinois Code 5/16-128(c), and shall not be construed to impose upon Purchaser any obligation that is greater than that imposed by 220 Illinois Code 5/16-128(c). For purposes of this Article VI, the term "Active Employees" shall include all full-time and part-time employees, employees on workers' compensation, military leave, special military leave, maternity leave, leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, union leave, sick leave, domestic violence leave, long-term disability, or layoff with recall rights, and employees on other approved leaves of absence with a legal or contractual right to reinstatement, in each case who are employed by any IPC Company. Transferred Employees who are not represented by labor unions or similar collective bargaining entities are referred to as "Non-Union Transferred Employees." (b) Recognition of Transferred Employee Service. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall recognize the service of each Non-Union Transferred Employee prior to the Closing for each IPC Company, Seller and any Affiliates of Seller for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual to the extent that such service was credited to each Non-Union Transferred Employee by Seller, such IPC Company or such Affiliate, as applicable, under a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan, except (i) for benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan and (ii) to the extent that such credit would result in duplication of benefits, provided that Seller provides, as soon as practicable after the Closing, a list containing each Transferred Employee's service credited by Seller to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates adopts a benefit plan that provides benefits of a type that Transferred Employees had not received from Seller and its Affiliates before the Closing, Purchaser and/or such Affiliate(s) (as applicable) may credit service for Transferred Employees in the same manner as it credits service for other similarly situated employees. Commencing ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cooperate in good faith with Purchaser to determine, and effectuate, the most expeditious procedures subject to the limitations of applicable Law, for transferring from Seller to Purchaser such data relating to Transferred Employees that is necessary for the operation of employee benefit plans maintained by Purchaser in which Transferred Employees will participate immediately after Closing and so that all personnel records of Transferred Employees, the service of all Transferred Employees and all other information reasonably determined by Purchaser to be needed by Purchaser in connection with the employment of Transferred Employees will be provided to Purchaser on or prior to Closing. 58
(c) Altenbaumer Contract. Dynegy shall take any steps necessary or appropriate so that neither Purchaser nor any IPC Company is required to assume the agreements with Larry F. Altenbaumer identified on Schedule 6.1(c) (the "Altenbaumer Contract"), and Dynegy shall retain, and be solely responsible for, all obligations and liabilities under the Altenbaumer Contract. Dynegy hereby agrees that any provision of services to Purchaser, the IPC Companies and/or any of their respective Affiliates after the date hereof will not be considered to violate any of the provisions of Section 4 of the Altenbaumer Contract. (d) Schukar Contract. Dynegy and IPC shall take any steps necessary or appropriate so that, effective not later than as of the Closing, Dynegy assigns to IPC and IPC assumes the Contract with Shawn E. Schukar identified on Schedule 6.1(d). (e) Termination of Plan Participation and Accruals; Assumption of Obligation to Pay Bonuses. Dynegy and the IPC Companies shall take all actions necessary and appropriate so that the participation of the IPC Companies in all Employee Benefit Plans is terminated before the Closing. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Transferred Employees shall not accrue benefits under any Employee Benefit Plans or any employee benefit policies, plans, arrangements, programs, practices or agreements of Seller or any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date. For the year in which the Closing Date occurs, Purchaser shall pay, or cause one of its Affiliates to pay, to the Transferred Employees any bonuses that would have been payable to the Transferred Employees for that year had the Transferred Employees remained employees of any Seller or one of its Affiliates, in accordance with the provisions of the policy, plan, arrangement, program, practice or agreement under which the bonus would have been paid (the "Seller Bonus Plans"), provided such Seller Bonus Plans are specifically identified as such on Schedule 6.1(e) and provided, further, that accruals have been made as of the Closing Date on the Working Capital Statements for the IPC Companies in accordance with GAAP. In determining the amount of the bonuses to be paid by Purchaser in accordance with the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall apply criteria that are substantially comparable to the criteria established as of the Closing Date under the Seller Bonus Plans under which the bonuses would have been paid had the Transferred Employees remained employees of any Seller or one of its Affiliates, and in no event shall Purchaser be obligated to pay aggregate bonuses under the Seller Bonus Plans that exceed the sum of $3 million plus the amount accrued as of the Closing Date for such bonuses on the Working Capital Statements for the IPC Companies. (f) No Duplicate Benefits. Nothing in this Agreement shall cause duplicate benefits to be paid or provided to or with respect to a Transferred Employee under any employee benefit policies, plans, arrangements, programs, practices or agreements. References herein to a benefit with respect to a Transferred Employee shall include, where applicable, benefits with respect to any eligible dependents and beneficiaries of such Transferred Employee under the same employee benefit policy, plan, arrangement, program, practice or agreement. (g) Affiliate Employees. Schedule 6.1(g) sets forth a list of those Active Employees (if any) who, as of the date hereof, are performing services for any IPC Company but are employed by an Affiliate of Seller (other than any IPC Company) (the "Affiliate Employees"). The list of Affiliate Employees shall be updated not less than 90 days prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser may offer to employ as of the Closing Date such Affiliate Employees 59
with the consent of Seller. Each such Affiliate Employee who accepts such offer of employment shall be a Transferred Employee and shall be treated under this Agreement in a manner that is comparable to the treatment given to the Transferred Employees who were employed by an IPC Company. (h) Term of Assumed Obligations. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.1 to the contrary, and except as otherwise expressly provided by Law or this Agreement or in any Contract with or on behalf of a bargaining unit to which any IPC Company is a party, Purchaser retains the right to determine after the Closing the number of non-supervisory and supervisory employees it deems sufficient to operate and maintain operations and facilities acquired hereunder, and Purchaser and its Affiliates may, at any time after the Closing, terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee or renegotiate, alter, amend or terminate any agreement or Contract concerning employment or any term thereof, any employee benefit plan, or the participation of any Transferred Employee in any such plan. Section 6.2 Transferred Employee Benefit Matters. (a) Defined Benefit Plans. (i) Seller Pension Plans. As of the date of this Agreement, Transferred Employees participate in the single-employer defined benefit pension plans listed in Schedule 6.2(a), which plans are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "Seller Pension Plans" and individually as a "Seller Pension Plan." The Seller Pension Plans also cover the Other Plan Participants (as such term is defined below). Each other person who, immediately before the Closing Date, has an accrued benefit (which remains payable in whole or in part) under a Seller Pension Plan, and is either (a) a former employee of any IPC Company or a predecessor to any IPC Company who is no longer actively employed by Dynegy, any IPC Company or any of their respective Affiliates (such as Retirees) or (b) a beneficiary or an alternate payee of an individual described in clause (a) or of a Transferred Employee is referred to in this Section 6.2(a) as an "Other Plan Participant." Within the 60-day period immediately preceding any transfer of assets and liabilities from a Seller Pension Plan to a Purchaser Pension Plan pursuant to this Section 6.2(a), Dynegy shall provide the Purchaser with a written certification, in a form acceptable to Purchaser, that the Seller Pension Plan satisfies each of the following requirements: (A) the Seller Pension Plan is a single-employer defined benefit plan that, to the Knowledge of Dynegy and Seller, is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; (B) the Seller Pension Plan does not have any "accumulated funding deficiency" as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived, immediately before the Closing Date; (C) the Seller Pension Plan is not the subject of termination proceedings or a notice of termination under Title IV of ERISA; and (D) the Seller Pension Plan does not violate the requirements of any applicable collective bargaining agreement covering any Transferred Employees or Other Plan Participants. (ii) Purchaser Obligations. Purchaser shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to ensure that, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Purchaser, or one of its Affiliates, maintains or adopts one or more pension plans (hereinafter referred to in the aggregate as the "Purchaser Pension Plans" and individually as the "Purchaser Pen- 60
sion Plan") effective as of the Closing Date and to ensure that each Purchaser Pension Plan satisfies the following requirements as of the Closing Date: (A) the Purchaser Pension Plan is a single-employer defined benefit plan that, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; (B) any Purchaser Pension Plan that was in effect before the Closing Date is in compliance with the funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code; (C) the Purchaser Pension Plan is not the subject of termination proceedings or a notice of termination under Title IV of ERISA; (D) the Purchaser Pension Plan does not exclude Transferred Employees, as a class, from eligibility to participate therein; and (E) the Purchaser Pension Plan does not violate the requirements of any applicable collective bargaining agreement covering any Transferred Employees or Other Plan Participants. No later than ten days after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Dynegy with a written certification that the Purchaser Pension Plan satisfies each of the requirements set forth in this Section 6.2(a)(ii). (iii) Transfer of Liabilities. (A) In accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.2(a), Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Pension Plans to accept all liabilities for benefits under the Seller Pension Plans, whether or not vested, that would have been paid or payable (but for the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Section 6.2(a)) to or with respect to the Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants under the terms of the Seller Pension Plans, including all liabilities for "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits" (as defined by Section 411(d)(6) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) that have accrued under the Seller Pension Plans to or with respect to the Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor the Purchaser Pension Plans shall assume such liabilities if Dynegy, Seller and the Seller Pension Plans do not comply in all material respects with the provisions of Section 6.2(a)(i) and (iv). Purchaser shall not amend the Purchaser Pension Plans, or permit the Purchaser Pension Plans to be amended, to eliminate any benefit accrued as of the Closing, whether or not vested, with respect to which liabilities are transferred pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection (A), including any such benefit that is a "Section 411(d)(6) protected benefit" (as defined by Section 411(d)(6) of the Code and regulations thereunder), except to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Neither Dynegy nor Seller shall take any action to accelerate the vesting of Transferred Employees in their benefits (if any) under the Seller Pension Plans. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Seller Pension Plans shall continue to make all Benefit Payments to Other Plan Participants until both the Initial Transfer Amount and True-Up Amount have been transferred to the Purchaser Pension Plans. (B) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Dynegy shall deliver to Purchaser a list reflecting each Transferred Employee's service and compensation under each of the Seller Pension Plans, each Transferred Employee's and Other Plan Participant's accrued benefit thereunder as of the Closing Date, and a copy of each pending or final domestic relations order affecting the benefit of any Transferred Employee or Other Plan Participant. 61
(iv) Transfer of Assets. (A) Not later than 90 days after the Closing, Dynegy shall cause its actuary to calculate the Accrued Liability of each participant in each Seller Pension Plan who is a Transferred Employee or Other Plan Participant and then to compare, on a Seller Pension Plan by Seller Pension Plan basis, the Accrued Liability of all the participants and beneficiaries in each Seller Pension Plan to the fair market value of the assets of the respective Seller Pension Plan as of the last day of the calendar month in which the Closing Date occurs (the "Date of Spinoff"). If the Accrued Liability of all participants and beneficiaries in a Seller Pension Plan is less than the fair market value of the assets of that Seller Pension Plan, then, in accordance with this Section 6.2(a)(iv), Dynegy shall cause to be transferred to a trust established by Purchaser as part of the respective Purchaser Pension Plan assets having a value equal to the Accrued Liability under such Seller Pension Plan for all Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants, where each such Accrued Liability shall be determined as of the Date of Spinoff. If the total Accrued Liability under a Seller Pension Plan is equal to or more than the fair market value of the assets of that Seller Pension Plan, then Dynegy shall cause its actuary to determine the amount of assets allocable to the Accrued Liabilities of the Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants in that Seller Pension Plan based on Section 4044 of ERISA (the "Section 4044 Amount"); and, in accordance with this Section 6.2(a)(iv), Dynegy shall cause assets having a value equal to the Section 4044 Amount applicable to the Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants under such Seller Pension Plan to be transferred to the trust established by Purchaser as part of the respective Purchaser Pension Plan. All such asset transfers shall take place in accordance with the procedures set forth below in this Section 6.2(a), and shall be in cash and/or other assets determined by mutual agreement of Dynegy and Purchaser. (B) The Accrued Liability or the Section 4044 Amount (whichever is applicable) for each Seller Pension Plan shall be referred to in this Section 6.2(a)(iv)(B) as "X", and all transfers of assets to each Purchaser Pension Plan with respect to "X" shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.2(a)(iv)(B). The initial transfer with respect to each Seller Pension Plan shall be made no later than the later of: (1) 30 days after the end of the calendar month that includes the Closing Date; or (2) the date on which the requirements of Section 6.2(a)(ii) and the requirements of Section 6.2(a)(iv)(E) have been satisfied. The date determined under the prior sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the "Initial Transfer Date". Dynegy shall cause the trust which is a part of each Seller Pension Plan to make an initial transfer, on the Initial Transfer Date to the trust which is a part of the corresponding Purchaser Pension Plan of assets having a value equal to 85% of the amount estimated by Dynegy in good faith (determined on a termination basis using the interest factors specified by the PBGC as in effect as of the Closing Date) to be equal to "X" with respect to each Seller Pension Plan (the "Initial Transfer Amount"); provided, however, if Purchaser has satisfied the requirements of Section 6.2(a)(ii) and the requirements of Section 6.2(a)(iv)(E) have been satisfied and the Seller Pension Plans do not transfer the Initial Transfer Amount as of the Initial Transfer Date, Dynegy shall immediately thereafter cause the Seller Pension Plans to transfer to the Purchaser Pension Plans an amount equal to 75 percent of the fair market value of the assets of each Seller Pension Plan and such amount shall for all purposes of this Agreement 62
then be deemed to be the Initial Transfer Amount. Dynegy prior to the Initial Transfer Date for each Seller Pension Plan shall provide Purchaser with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that such Seller Pension Plan continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. As soon as practicable after the date the final determination of the amounts to be transferred is made (the "True-Up Date"), but in no event more than 30 days after the final determination, Dynegy shall cause a second transfer to be made from the trust which is a part of each Seller Pension Plan to the trust which is a part of each Purchaser Pension Plan in cash equal to the True-Up Amount, if any, with respect to such Seller Pension Plan. The True-Up Amount, if any, for each Seller Pension Plan shall equal: "X" minus the Initial Transfer Amount minus benefit payments made to any Transferred Employees and Other Plan Participants by the Seller Pension Plan on or after the Closing Date ("Benefit Payments"), as adjusted for earnings as calculated in accordance with this Section 6.2(a)(iv)(B). Earnings shall be calculated in accordance with this Section 6.2(a)(iv)(B) as follows: (1) earnings shall be calculated from the Date of Spinoff to the Initial Transfer Date on an amount equal to the Initial Transfer Amount using the compound monthly rate of return (considering both gains and losses) earned or lost for the same period on the assets of the trust from which the True-Up Amount is being transferred; and (2) earnings shall be calculated from the Date of Spinoff to the True-Up Date on an amount equal to "X" minus the sum of the Initial Transfer Amount and such Benefit Payments using (a) with respect to the period from the Date of Spinoff to the last day of the calendar month preceding the True-Up Date, the compound monthly rate of return (considering both gains and losses) earned or lost on the assets of the trust from which the True-Up Amount is being transferred and (b) with respect to the period from the first day of the calendar month which includes the True-Up Date to the True-Up Date, the average rate of the 90-day Treasury Bill on the auction date which coincides with the first day of such calendar month or, if there is no auction on such date, the auction date which immediately precedes the first day of the calendar month which includes the True-Up Date. However, if the Initial Transfer Amount for a Seller Pension Plan plus the Benefit Payments made by such plan exceeded "X" with respect to such Seller Pension Plan, Purchaser as soon as practicable following such determination shall cause a transfer to be made in cash or such other assets as may be agreed upon by Dynegy and Purchaser from the trust which is a part of the corresponding Purchaser Pension Plan to the trust from which the Initial Transfer Amount was transferred equal to the difference between (i) the sum of such Initial Transfer Amount and such Benefit Payments and (ii) "X", adjusted to reflect earnings from the Initial Transfer Date until the date of such transfer from the trust which is a part of such Purchaser Pension Plan using (a) with respect to the period from the Initial Transfer Date to the last day of the calendar month preceding such transfer, the compound rate of return (considering both gains and losses) on the assets of such Purchaser Pension Plan and (b) with respect to the period from the first day of the calendar month in which the transfer occurs and the actual date of such transfer, the average rate of the 90-day Treasury Bill on the auction date coincident with the first day of the calendar month in which the transfer occurs or, if there is no auction on such date, on the auction date which immediately precedes the first day of the calendar month in which the transfer occurs. Unless Dynegy 63
and Purchaser agree otherwise, all transfers will occur on the last Business Day of a calendar month. Finally, notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.2(a)(iv) to the contrary, the transfers contemplated in this Section 6.2(a)(iv) shall comply with Section 414(l) of the Code and the related regulations, and the amount expressly called for to be transferred pursuant to this Section 6.2(a)(iv) shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to satisfy Section 414(l) of the Code and the related regulations as well as Section 4044 of ERISA and the related regulations. (C) For purposes of this Section 6.2(a)(iv), the term "Accrued Liability" shall mean with respect to each Seller Pension Plan the present value of the accrued benefit, as of the Closing Date, of each Transferred Employee, each Other Plan Participant and each other participant or beneficiary in such Seller Pension Plan, determined on a termination basis using the interest factors specified by the PBGC as in effect as of the Date of Spinoff for an immediate or deferred annuity as appropriate for each such person and using the other methods and factors specified in the PBGC's regulations for the valuation of accrued benefits upon a plan termination. The Accrued Liability and the Section 4044 Amount shall be determined by an enrolled actuary designated by Dynegy, and Dynegy shall provide within 90 days after the Closing Date any actuary designated by Purchaser with all the information reasonably necessary to review the calculations of the Accrued Liability and the Section 4044 Amount and to verify that such calculations have been performed in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. If there is a good faith dispute between Dynegy's actuary and Purchaser's actuary as to the amount to be transferred to any plan under this Section 6.2(a) and such dispute remains unresolved for 30 days, the chief financial officers of Dynegy and Purchaser shall endeavor to resolve the dispute. If such dispute remains unresolved for 60 days, Dynegy and Purchaser shall select and appoint a third actuary who is mutually satisfactory to both Dynegy and Purchaser and who shall recalculate the disputed amount using the actuarial assumptions described in this Section 6.2(a)(iv)(C). The decision of such third party actuary shall be rendered within 30 days and shall be conclusive as to any dispute for which such actuary was appointed. The cost of such third party actuary shall be divided equally between Dynegy and Purchaser. Purchaser and Dynegy each shall be responsible for the cost of its own actuary. (D) In the event that, prior to the later of (i) the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date or (ii) October 15, 2005, either party's actuary shall determine that there has been a material error such that the True-Up Amount was incorrect, that actuary shall determine the correct True-Up Amount and the amount that must be transferred between the respective trusts for the Seller Pension Plans and the Purchaser Pension Plans to correct such error (the "Correction Amount"), and shall provide the other party's actuary with all the information reasonably necessary to review the calculations of the Correction Amount and to verify that such calculations have been performed in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Any good faith dispute between Dynegy's actuary and Purchaser's actuary as to the Correction Amount shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute-resolution provisions set forth in Section 6.2(b)(iv)(C). As soon as practicable after the date of the final determination of the Correction Amount, but in no event more than 30 days after such date, Dynegy or Purchaser, as applicable, shall cause the appropriate trust to transfer cash equal to the Correction Amount, as adjusted for earnings 64
calculated in accordance with Section 6.2(a)(iv)(B) from the True-Up Date through the date of such transfer. (E) In connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Section 6.2(a), Dynegy and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate with each other in making all appropriate filings required by the Code or ERISA and the regulations thereunder, and the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) shall not take place until as soon as practicable after the latest of (1) the expiration of the 30-day period following the filing of any required notices with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 6058(b) of the Code, (2) the date Purchaser has delivered to Dynegy a copy of the Purchaser Pension Plan and, with respect to a Purchaser Pension Plan in effect on the date of the Closing, a copy of the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Purchaser Pension Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, together with documentation reasonably satisfactory to Dynegy of the due adoption of any amendments to the Purchaser Pension Plan required by the Internal Revenue Service as a condition to such qualification and a certification from Purchaser that no events have occurred that adversely affect the continued validity of such determination letter (apart from the enactment of any Federal law for which the remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code has not yet expired), (3) the date Dynegy has delivered to Purchaser a copy of the most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that each Seller Pension Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, together with documentation reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser of the due adoption of any amendments to each Seller Pension Plan required by the Internal Revenue Service as a condition to such qualification and a certification from Dynegy that no events have occurred that adversely affect the continued validity of such determination letter (apart from the enactment of any Federal law for which the remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code has not yet expired), and (4) the receipt of information enabling the enrolled actuary for the Purchaser Pension Plan to issue the certification required by Section 6058(b) of the Code. (b) Savings Plans. (i) As of the date of this Agreement, Transferred Employees participate in the defined contribution plans listed in Schedule 6.2(b) (collectively referred to as the "Seller Savings Plans"). Except as provided in Section 6.2(b)(v), Transferred Employees shall not be entitled to make contributions to or to benefit from matching or other contributions under the Seller Savings Plans on and after the Closing Date. (ii) Purchaser shall take all action necessary and appropriate to ensure that, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Purchaser maintains or adopts one or more savings plans (hereinafter referred to in the aggregate as the "Purchaser Savings Plans" and individually as the "Purchaser Savings Plan") effective as of the Closing Date and to ensure that each Purchaser Savings Plan satisfies the following requirements as of the Closing Date: (A) the Purchaser Savings Plan is a qualified, single-employer individual account plan under Section 401(a) of the Code; (B) the Purchaser Savings Plan does not exclude Transferred Employees from eligibility to participate therein; (C) the Purchaser Savings Plan permits Transferred Employees to make before-tax contributions (under 65
Section 401(k) of the Code) and provides for matching contributions by Purchaser; and (D) the Purchaser Savings Plan does not violate the requirements of any applicable collective bargaining agreement. (iii) The terms of the Purchaser Savings Plans, or each such Purchaser Savings Plan, shall provide that the Transferred Employees shall have the right to make direct rollovers to such plan of their accounts in a Seller Savings Plan, including a direct rollover of any notes evidencing loans made to such Transferred Employees; provided, that in no event shall the Purchaser Savings Plans be required to accept the transfer of Dynegy common stock; and provided, further, that Purchaser's obligation to accept rollovers of loans shall be limited as follows: (A) only loans to Transferred Employees who elect to roll over their entire account balances, and who are not in default with respect to their loans at the time of the rollover, are required to be accepted; and (B) Purchaser may impose such procedural requirements as it deems necessary or appropriate to facilitate the rollovers (including, for example, requiring that such rollovers take place at not more than two specified times and requiring Dynegy to amend the Seller Savings Plans as necessary to ensure that the rollovers are permitted to take place in accordance with this Section 6.2(b)). (iv) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a list of the Transferred Employees covered by the Seller Savings Plans, together with each Transferred Employee's service under each of the Seller Savings Plans as of the Closing Date. (v) Seller shall contribute all Transferred Employees' contributions that are based on compensation received prior to the Closing Date and shall make all required matching contributions with respect to the Transferred Employees' contributions to the Seller Savings Plans that are (A) eligible for matching and (B) made while employed by Seller or its Affiliates before the Closing Date. Such matching contributions shall be made not later than the date on which all other matching contributions are made to the Seller Savings Plans with respect to contributions made at the same time as the Transferred Employees' contributions. (c) Retiree Medical Benefits. (i) Purchaser as of the Closing Date shall assume the liabilities, obligations and responsibilities of Seller and its Affiliates to provide post-retirement medical, health and life insurance benefits to each former employee of any IPC Company or any predecessor of any IPC Company whose employment terminated on or before the Closing Date and any spouse, dependents or beneficiary of such former employee (individually a "Retiree" and collectively the "Retirees") which Seller or its Affiliates were obligated to provide immediately before the Closing Date, including any liabilities, obligations or responsibilities which Seller or its Affiliates funded through one, or more than one, trust described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (individually a "Seller's VEBA" and collectively the "Seller's VEBAs"); provided that Purchaser or its Affiliates may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, change, amend or terminate such benefits at any time. Purchaser, as part of such assumption, shall establish or maintain, as of the Closing Date, a 66
trust, or more than one trust, described in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (the "Purchaser's VEBA"), the assets of which shall fund such post-retirement benefits for such Retirees and Transferred Employees, and Seller as part of such assumption shall cause each Seller's VEBA to transfer cash or assets, or cash and assets, to the Purchaser's VEBA in accordance with this Section 6.2(c) to fund the payment of such post-retirement benefits following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not assume such liabilities if Seller does not comply in all material respects with the provisions of Section 6.2(c)(ii). (ii) All transfers of cash or assets, or cash and assets, to Purchaser's VEBA shall be made as soon as administratively feasible after the Closing Date or within 20 days following the date on which Seller has been provided evidence that Purchaser's VEBA satisfies the requirements for a tax exempt trust under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, if such date is later than the Closing Date (the "VEBA Transfer Date"). Seller on the VEBA Transfer Date shall cause each Seller's VEBA to make a transfer of all of the cash and assets of each Seller's VEBA. In addition, all assets held in any 401(h) account under any Seller Pension Plan shall be transferred to a 401(h) account established under the Purchaser Pension Plan(s) designated by Purchaser no later than the Initial Transfer Date; provided, that Purchaser has provided Seller with written evidence of the establishment of such account. (iii) Purchaser as of the Closing Date shall assume the liabilities, obligations and responsibilities of Seller and its Affiliates for the post-retirement medical and other welfare benefits described in Section 6.2(c)(i) for all Transferred Employees and their eligible spouses, dependents and beneficiaries. Purchaser shall satisfy any requirements of any applicable collective bargaining agreement covering Transferred Employees with respect to retiree medical, health, and life insurance benefits. Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide retiree medical, health and life insurance benefits to any Transferred Employee after the Closing Date. (d) Other Welfare Benefits. (i) Purchaser shall take all action necessary and appropriate to ensure that, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Purchaser maintains or adopts, as of the Closing Date, one or more employee welfare benefit plans, including medical, health, dental, flexible spending account, accident, life, and long-term disability and other employee welfare benefit plans (including retiree medical and life but excluding severance benefits) for the benefit of the Transferred Employees (the "Purchaser Welfare Plans"). Any restrictions on coverage for pre-existing conditions or requirements for evidence of insurability under the Purchaser Welfare Plans shall be waived for Transferred Employees, except to the extent that such restrictions or requirements have not been satisfied under corresponding plans of Seller and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date. Transferred Employees shall receive credit under the Purchaser Welfare Plans for co-payments and payments under a deductible limit made by them and for out-of-pocket maximums applicable to them during the plan year of the welfare plans maintained by Seller on the Closing Date (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Seller Welfare Plans") in accordance with the corresponding Seller Welfare Plans. 67
(ii) Dynegy and Seller shall retain responsibility for any valid claim under a Seller Welfare Plan for disability or life insurance benefits made by a Transferred Employee on or after the Closing Date arising from a claim incurred on or before the Closing Date. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim for life insurance is deemed incurred when the death occurs and a claim for long term disability benefits is deemed incurred on the first day the employee is absent from work as a result of the condition that results in entitlement to disability benefits. As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make available the appropriate Transferred Employees to administer and process any claim under a Seller Welfare Plan for medical or dental benefits made by a Transferred Employee on or after the Closing Date arising from a claim incurred on or before the Closing Date. Upon receipt of proof of payment reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any medical or dental claim incurred prior to Closing and that is properly paid under a Seller Welfare Plan for any Transferred Employee. For purposes of this paragraph, a medical or dental claim is considered incurred when the services are rendered, the supplies are provided or medication is prescribed, and not when the condition arose, except that claims relating to a hospital confinement that begins before the Closing Date shall be treated as incurred on or before the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 6.2(d) shall require any party or benefit plan to make any payment or to provide any benefit not otherwise provided by the terms of the Seller Welfare Plans or applicable Law. (iii) Seller, Purchaser, their respective Affiliates, and the Seller Welfare Plans and the Purchaser Welfare Plans shall assist and cooperate with each other in the disposition of claims made under the Seller Welfare Plans and the Purchaser Welfare Plan, and in providing each other with any records, documents, or other information within its control or to which it has access that is reasonably requested by any other as necessary or appropriate to the disposition, settlement or defense of such claims. From and after the date of this Agreement, Dynegy and Seller shall cause the processing and payment of claims for medical and dental benefits under the Seller Welfare Plans to continue in the normal course consistent with past practice and in any event as expeditiously as possible. (iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller or its Affiliates to transfer assets or reserves with respect to pre-retirement benefits under the Seller Welfare Plans to Purchaser or the Purchaser Welfare Plans. (v) Non-Union Transferred Employees shall be eligible for benefits under Purchaser severance or separation pay policies or plans that are the same as or comparable to those provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates. (vi) Seller shall be responsible for satisfying "continuation coverage" requirements for all "group health plans" under Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and comparable state law ("COBRA") with respect to each employee of any Seller or the IPC Companies who does not become a Transferred Employee (and any spouse, dependents or beneficiary of such employee or other employee), with respect to each former employee of any Seller or any IPC Company or any predecessor of any IPC Company whose employment terminated on or before the Closing Date and any spouse, dependents or beneficiary of such former employee, and with respect to Transferred Employees (and any spouse, dependents or beneficiary of such employee or other employee) 68
with respect to qualifying events that occur on or before the Closing Date. Seller will provide any notices to Transferred Employees required under COBRA and will comply with any other applicable provisions of COBRA in connection with their termination of employment by Seller and its Affiliates. Purchaser shall be responsible for satisfying "continuation coverage" requirements for all "group health plans" under COBRA with respect to each Transferred Employee (and any spouse, dependents or beneficiary of such Transferred Employee) who experiences a "qualifying event" within the meaning of COBRA after the Closing Date. (vii) Seller shall disclose to Purchaser, within 30 days after the Closing Date, the unused flexible spending account (the "FSA") balances of each Transferred Employee and shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, transfer such amounts to a plan maintained by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates. Purchaser shall cause to be maintained for the duration of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs all such unused FSA account balances of the Transferred Employees that are so transferred. Section 6.3 Miscellaneous Benefits. On or after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall: (a) assume all liabilities of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller with respect to any accrued but unused vacation time of Transferred Employees to the extent that it is an accrued liability on the financial statements; and (b) allow Transferred Employees to receive paid time off on or after the Closing Date for any unused vacation time accrued on the financial statements prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the applicable policies of Purchaser, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law or regulation. For purposes of applying such policies of Purchaser, Purchaser shall treat service of the Transferred Employees with any Seller and its Affiliates as though it were service with Purchaser. Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability to pay Transferred Employees for the vacation time described in this Section 6.3. Section 6.4 Employee Rights. (a) Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any employee of any IPC Company, Seller or its Affiliates, or Purchaser or its Affiliates, or upon any legal representative of such employee, or upon any collective bargaining agent, any rights or remedies, including any third party beneficiary rights or any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon any person (nor any beneficiary thereof) any rights under or with respect to any plan, program, or arrangement described in or contemplated by this Agreement, and each person (and any beneficiary thereof) shall be entitled to look only to the express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for his or her rights thereunder. (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall cause Purchaser or its Affiliates to have any obligation to provide employment to any individual who is not an Active Employee or Affiliate Employee or, except as otherwise provided in applicable collective bargaining agreements, to 69
continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any period of time following the Closing Date. Section 6.5 WARN Act Requirements. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be responsible with respect to Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries for compliance with the WARN Act and any similar state or local Law, including any requirement to provide for and discharge any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to Transferred Employees and Governmental Authorities that might be imposed as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. Purchaser shall not take any action within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment of any employees employed by any IPC Company or Seller or their Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" under the WARN Act or any similar state or local Law or create any liability to Seller or its Affiliates for employment terminations under the WARN Act or any similar state or local Law, it being understood that to enable Purchaser to comply with this requirement, Seller shall first inform Purchaser upon the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as is practicable of all employees, by location, terminated by any IPC Company or its Affiliates other than for cause or through voluntary resignation or retirement within the preceding 90 days. Section 6.6 Retention of Certain Liabilities by Dynegy. Following the Closing, Dynegy and its Affiliates covenant to retain all liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to (a) the investigation, litigation and other matters described in items 2 and 5 of Schedule 3.9, (b) except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article VI, any Controlled Group Liabilities, (c) notwithstanding Section 7.8(b), any liability for failure to properly report taxable income or withhold applicable Taxes with respect to the provision, before the Closing, of the benefits described in item 1 under "Oral Employee Benefit Plans and Compensation Arrangements" on Schedule 3.10, (d) except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article VI, the Employee Benefit Plans listed in Schedule 3.10 under "Employee Benefit Plans," other than item 16, and (e) the Compensation Arrangements listed in Schedule 3.10 under "Compensation Arrangements," other than items 4 and 7. ARTICLE VII TAX MATTERS AND INDEMNIFICATION Section 7.1 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns. (a) Seller shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, on a basis consistent with past practice (except as required by applicable Law or a Final Determination), all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to any IPC Company (i) in the case of Income Tax Returns, for any taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of Non-Income Tax Returns, that have not yet been filed and are due (taking into account extensions properly obtained) on or before the Closing Date, and in all cases Seller shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Dynegy shall allow Purchaser to review any Non-Income Tax Returns relating to any IPC 70
Company required to be filed on or before the Closing Date at IPC's offices in Decatur, Illinois, during normal business hours prior to filing such Tax Returns. (b) Purchaser shall timely prepare, or cause to be prepared, on a basis consistent with past practice (except as required by applicable Law or a Final Determination), all Income Tax Returns with respect to any IPC Company for any Straddle Period. Purchaser shall present such Income Tax Returns to Seller for review at least 30 days before the date on which such Income Tax Returns are required to be filed. Unless Seller objects in writing at least five days before the date on which such Income Tax Returns are due (the sole basis for which shall be Purchaser's failure to prepare such Income Tax Returns on a basis consistent with past practice), Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, such Income Tax Returns. Purchaser shall remit or cause to be remitted any Income Taxes due in respect of such Income Tax Returns, provided that Seller shall pay Purchaser, no later than three days prior to the date such Income Taxes are due, an amount equal to the amount of such Income Taxes that are attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the case of any Straddle Period all Income Taxes shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period on a closing of the books basis. (c) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to any IPC Company (i) in the case of Income Tax Returns, for any taxable period that begins after the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of Non-Income Tax Returns, that have not yet been filed and are due (taking into account extensions properly obtained) after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall prepare any Non-Income Tax Returns described in clause (ii) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period consistent with past practice (except as required by applicable Law or a Final Determination), and in all cases Purchaser shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall allow Dynegy to review any Non-Income Tax Returns described in clause (ii) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period at Purchaser's offices in Decatur, Illinois, during normal business hours prior to filing such Tax Returns. (d) Without the written consent of Dynegy (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), Purchaser will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, file any amended Income Tax Returns, carry-back claim, or other adjustment relating to Income Taxes or take any other action with respect to Income Taxes relating to any IPC Company for, or to, any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date, in each case except as required by a Final Determination. Section 7.2 Cooperation. The Seller Indemnitors and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees and other representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns required to be filed under Section 7.1 and in resolving or managing all disputes or Audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Tax Returns or Taxes required to be filed or paid by or with respect to any IPC Company and in any other matters relating to Taxes required to be paid by or with respect to any IPC Company, including (a) by maintaining, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, and making available to each other all books and records and all relevant correspondence with Governmental Authorities in connection with Tax Returns or Taxes required to be filed or paid by or with respect to any IPC Company; (b) by promptly informing 71
each other of notices of any Tax Audit or other Tax proceeding in respect of which one or more of the parties or any of its Affiliates may have a liability; and (c) by executing any reasonably necessary powers of attorney. Section 7.3 Transfer Taxes. The Dynegy Parties (other than IPC), on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall share equally all documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains, registration, value added, transfer, stamp, recording and similar Taxes, fees and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees, additions to tax or additional amounts with respect thereto incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). The Dynegy Parties (other than IPC) and Purchaser shall be responsible for jointly preparing and timely filing (and cooperating with one another in preparing and filing) any Tax Returns required with respect to any such Transfer Taxes. The party responsible under the applicable Transfer Tax law for paying a Transfer Tax (the "Transfer Tax Party") shall make due and timely payment of the Transfer Tax to the applicable Taxing Authority, provided that the other party pays the Transfer Tax Party, no later than two Business Days prior to the date such Transfer Tax is due, such other party's 50% share of such Transfer Tax. The Transfer Tax Party will provide the other party a true copy of each such Tax Return as filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof. Section 7.4 FIRPTA Certificate. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser at the Closing a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, certifying that the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code. Section 7.5 Tax Sharing Arrangements. Seller shall cause the provisions of any Tax Sharing Arrangement between any IPC Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any IPC Company), on the other hand, to be terminated as of the Closing Date, and any such Tax sharing Arrangements shall have no further effect for any taxable year or period (whether current, future or past), except to the extent of Non-Income Tax liabilities included in the calculation of Final Adjusted Working Capital. Section 7.6 Tax Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to any Tax Refund resulting from any Final Determination regarding Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (except to the extent such Taxes have been actually borne by Purchaser). If any such Tax Refund is received by Purchaser, any IPC Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, Purchaser shall forward any such Tax Refund to Seller (including any interest actually received) within ten days after receipt thereof. Purchaser shall pay Seller interest at the rate prescribed under Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on any amount not paid when due in accordance with the foregoing sentence. Purchaser shall be entitled to any Tax Refund resulting from any Final Determination regarding Taxes for any Post-Closing Tax Period. If any such Tax Refund is received by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, Seller shall forward any such Tax Refund to Purchaser (including any interest actually received) within ten days after receipt thereof. Seller shall pay Purchaser interest at the rate prescribed under Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on any amount not paid when due in accordance with the foregoing sentence. 72
Section 7.7 Section 338(h)(10) Election. (a) The parties hereto agree that they will jointly make a timely and irrevocable election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and, if permissible, under any applicable state or local Income Tax laws) with respect to Purchaser's purchase of the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Dynegy, Seller, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall report the transactions consistent with such Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position contrary thereto unless and to the extent required to do so pursuant to a Final Determination. (b) Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing drafts of all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election (including Internal Revenue Service Forms 8023 and 8883 and any similar forms under applicable state or local income tax laws (the "Section 338 Forms")). The parties shall execute and deliver Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 at the Closing, which form shall be final and binding on the parties without further adjustment. At least 120 days prior to the latest date for the filing of each other Section 338 Form, Purchaser shall furnish Seller with a copy of each such draft Section 338 Form prepared by Purchaser together with a copy of a report (the "Allocation Report") of the proposed allocation of the purchase price for federal income tax purposes (less any amount allocated to the EEI Shares pursuant to Schedule 7.7). If within 30 days of Seller's receipt of such Section 338 Form and Allocation Report, Seller shall not have objected in writing to such Section 338 Form or Allocation Report, such Section 338 Form and Allocation Report shall be final and binding on the parties and the IPC Companies without any further adjustment. If at least 60 days prior to the latest date for the filing of such Section 338 Form, Seller and Purchaser cannot agree upon the final form and content of such Section 338 Form or the Allocation Report, any disagreement with respect to such Section 338 Form or the Allocation Report shall be resolved, at least 30 days before the last day for the filing of such Section 338 Form, by the Accounting Firm. The resolution of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties and the IPC Companies without any further adjustment. The Section 338 Form and the Allocation Report shall be revised to reflect the resolution of the Accounting Firm and, once revised, shall be final and binding on the parties and the IPC Companies without any further adjustment. The costs, expenses and fees of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. Once such Section 338 Form is final and no later than the last date for filing of such Section 338 Form, Dynegy, Seller and Purchaser shall execute such Section 338 Form, and Purchaser shall file such Section 338 Form with the applicable Taxing Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dynegy, Seller and Purchaser shall fully cooperate to jointly prepare and execute additional Section 338 Forms in a timely manner as reasonably necessary with respect to subsequent adjustments of Purchase Price following the Closing. (c) Schedule 7.7 sets forth the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares, on the one hand, and the EEI Shares, on the other hand. Seller and Purchaser agree, for all Tax purposes, to allocate any adjustment to the purchase price relating to the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares to the item or items to which it is principally attributable. 73
Section 7.8 Tax Indemnification. (a) After the Closing, the Seller Indemnitors shall be jointly and severally liable for and pay, and the Seller Indemnitors shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser Group Member from and against, any and all Indemnifiable Losses due to: (i) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to Dynegy or Seller or any of their Affiliates (other than any IPC Company), or for which Dynegy or Seller or any of their Affiliates (other than any IPC Company) may otherwise be liable, attributable to any and all taxable years or periods; (ii) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any IPC Company attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or resulting from any transaction in a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than (A) Non-Income Taxes imposed on or with respect to any IPC Company (except as otherwise provided in Article IX by reason of Section 3.8) and (B) any Income Taxes attributable to transactions or other activities of Purchaser or its Affiliates entered into or occurring after the Closing on the Closing Date that are not expressly contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent such transactions or activities are not entered into or do not occur in the ordinary course of business); (iii) any Taxes for which any IPC Company may be liable as a result of having been a member of any Company Group (including Taxes for which any IPC Company is or may be liable pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations or similar provisions of state or local Law as a result of having been a member of any Company Group, and any Taxes resulting from any IPC Company ceasing to be a member of any Company Group, as the case may be); and (iv) any Taxes resulting from or arising out of any Section 338(h)(10) Election. It is understood and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Seller Indemnitors shall be jointly and severally liable for and pay, and shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each IPC Company from and against, any and all Indemnifiable Losses due to any Income Taxes incurred by a Seller or any IPC Company attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of or relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) After the Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for and pay, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses due to: (i) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any IPC Company attributable to any Post-Closing Tax Period; (ii) Non-Income Taxes imposed on or with respect to any IPC Company; and (iii) any Income Taxes of any IPC Company attributable to transactions or other activities of Purchaser or its Affiliates entered into or occurring after the Closing on the Closing Date that are not expressly contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent such transactions or activities are not entered into or do not occur in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not indemnify or hold harmless any Seller Group Member from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses due to, Taxes for which Sellers are liable under this Agreement (including under Section 7.8(a) or Article IX (taking into account the limitations set forth in Section 9.5) by reason of a breach of Section 3.8). (c) Purchaser or Dynegy (on behalf of the Seller Group Members), as the case may be, as the Indemnified Party, shall promptly notify Dynegy (on behalf of the Seller Group Members) or Purchaser as the Indemnifying Party, in writing upon receipt by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax Audits that may give rise to an indemnification claim related to Taxes (a "Tax 74
Controversy") and thereafter shall promptly forward to the Indemnifying Party copies of notices and communications with the relevant Governmental Authority relating to such Tax Controversy, provided, however, that a failure to comply with this provision shall not affect the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure materially impairs the Indemnifying Party's ability to contest any such Tax liabilities. Except as provided in this Section 7.8(c), the Indemnifying Party may elect to control, and may elect to have sole discretion in handling, settling or contesting any Audit inquiry, information request, Audit proceeding, suit, contest or any other action with respect to a Tax Controversy for which it would be required to indemnify the other party, provided the Indemnifying Party first acknowledges in writing that it has liability for Taxes that might arise in such proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Tax proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy on a basis that would materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates without obtaining the Indemnified Party's written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in handling, settling or contesting a Tax Controversy that the Indemnifying Party has elected to control under this Section 7.8(c) shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, to the extent incurred during any period the Indemnifying Party is, in fact, actively contesting such Tax Controversy. Dynegy, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall jointly control, and shall each have the right to participate at its own expense in all activities and strategic decisions with respect to, any Tax proceedings for which each party would be required to indemnify the other party with respect to one or more Tax issues. Either Seller or Dynegy, or both, may assume sole control of any such Tax proceeding for any Straddle Period if it or they acknowledge(s) in writing that it or they has or have sole liability for any Taxes that might arise in such proceeding. Section 7.9 Survival and Coordination. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Section 3.8 and this Article VII shall survive the Closing until 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). Claims for indemnification with respect to Income Taxes shall be governed exclusively by this Article VII and Section 9.8 (but not by any other provision of Article IX). ARTICLE VIII CONDITIONS TO CLOSING Section 8.1 Conditions to Obligations of Seller.

The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Seller and Dynegy at or before the Closing shall have been complied with in all material respects.

Section 8.3 Effect of Certain Waivers of Closing Conditions. If prior to the Closing (i) any party (the "waiving party") has Knowledge of any breach by any other party of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the waiving party would have had the right not to proceed with the Closing as a result of such breach, and (iii) the waiving party proceeds with the Closing, the waiving party shall be deemed to have waived such breach and the waiving party and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to sue for damages or to assert any other right of remedy for any losses arising from any matters relating to such condition or breach, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto. Solely for purposes of this Section 8.3, Knowledge shall be deemed to mean (a) with respect to Purchaser, the actual knowledge (without independent inquiry) of the persons listed on Schedule 1.1(f) that Dynegy is able to demonstrate existed by clear and convincing evidence, and (b) with respect to Seller, the actual knowledge (without independent inquiry) of the persons listed on Schedule 1.1(f) that Purchaser is able to demonstrate existed by clear and convincing evidence. 78
ARTICLE IX INDEMNIFICATION Section 9.1 Obligations of Dynegy. Effective as of the Closing, the Seller Indemnitors shall jointly and severally (subject to the last sentence of this Section) indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless each Purchaser Group Member from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses due to: (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by any Dynegy Party, when made or at the Closing, in or pursuant to this Agreement (without regard to any qualifications as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, except as provided in Section 9.9); (b) any breach or nonperformance of any of the covenants or obligations of any Dynegy Party contained in this Agreement; (c) the Generation Liabilities; (d) the Excluded Environmental Matters; (e) any liability related to the Tilton Assets; (f) any obligation of any IPC Company as a guarantor of any underlying obligation of Dynegy or any of its Affiliates (other than an IPC Company); (g) any net refund of amounts under IPC's purchased gas adjustment ("PGA") rider ordered by the ICC, whether effected by adjustment of any PGA factor or otherwise, in any PGA reconciliation proceeding relating to any portion of the period from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2004, to the extent that payments or PGA adjustments required to be made by IPC pursuant to such order exceed the reserve established for potential liability in such proceeding as reflected in the calculation of the Final Adjusted Working Capital; or any disallowance by the ICC of IPC's gas costs or investment relating to events prior to the Closing at the Hillsboro gas storage field whether such disallowance shall be provided for in any PGA case ("working gas") or in a gas rate case ("cushion gas"), but only to the extent that such disallowance is not due to any imprudence by IPC after the Closing; provided, however, that the Seller Indemnitors' liability under this Section 9.1(g) with respect to any such refund or disallowance shall be equal to 50% of such refund or disallowance. With respect to indemnification required under Section 9.1(g), such indemnification shall be required notwithstanding the fact that the applicable order is subject to appeal, whether or not the full amount that IPC is required to pay or reflect in adjusted PGA rates under such order has been paid. In the event that the amount of IPC's liability pursuant to such order is later reduced or increased, as a result of appeal or otherwise, IPC shall refund the amount of such reduction to Dynegy, or Dynegy shall pay IPC the amount of such increase, as applicable; (h) the litigation described in item 3 of Schedule 3.9; or (i) the matters referred to in Schedule 5.19. 79
Section 9.2 Obligations of Purchaser. Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses due to: (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by Purchaser, when made or at the Closing, in or pursuant to this Agreement (without regard to any qualification as to materiality or material adverse effect); (b) any breach or nonperformance of any of the covenants or obligations of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or (c) the operation of the Business after the Closing. Section 9.3 Procedures. The following procedures shall apply with respect to indemnification claims: (a) Notice of Claims. Any party seeking indemnification of any Indemnifiable Loss or potential Indemnifiable Loss arising from an Indemnifiable Claim, whether asserted by a party or a third party, shall give written notice thereof to the party from whom indemnification is sought setting forth in reasonable detail the nature and reasonably estimated amount of, and basis for, such claim to the extent then known. Written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the existence of a third party claim shall be given by the Indemnified Party promptly after its receipt of an assertion of liability from the third party, and in any event within twenty days of such assertion; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure. Within 20 days of notice by the Indemnified Party of any Indemnifiable Loss or potential Indemnifiable Loss arising from an Indemnifiable Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for the Indemnifiable Loss or potential Indemnifiable Loss with respect to such Indemnifiable Claim. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed a refusal by the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party. (b) Defense. (i) In the case of a third party claim, the Indemnifying Party may participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses and irrevocably acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor, control the defense of an Indemnifiable Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that (x) a material conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect to the claim or its defense exists or is likely to develop during the pendency of the litigation, and as a result of such conflict, the Indemnifying Party's incentive to defend such claim could reasonably be expected to be materially compromised, or (y) the claim raises serious issues regarding the integrity or moral character of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or of its of their senior management, in its or their capacity as such (which issues are a fundamental element of the claim) then the In- 80
demnified Party shall be entitled to control the defense of the claim in accordance with paragraph (b)(ii) of this Section 9.3, it being understood that the mere allegation of fraud, willful misconduct, bad faith, malfeasance or any similar such claim as part of multiple claims constituting an Indemnifiable Claim, shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to provide the basis for the Indemnified Party's rights as set forth in this clause (y). In all cases, the party without the right to control the defense of the Indemnifiable Claim may participate in the defense at its own expense. In the case of a third party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall inform the Indemnified Party within 20 days of receiving the written notice seeking indemnification whether the party elects to control the defense and irrevocably acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof, provided that it either irrevocably acknowledges in writing its indemnity obligations with respect to the Indemnity Claim or it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that it is obligated hereunder to provide such indemnification. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to a potential Indemnifiable Claim or the amount thereof (whether or not it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a third party claim), the parties shall endeavor in good faith to settle such dispute. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise a third party claim or legal proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided that such prior written consent shall not be required with respect to any Indemnifiable Claim that relates to any item referred to in Sections 9.1(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i), except with respect to any Indemnifiable Claim relating to Remediation of Hazardous Substances that is covered by Section 5.18 shall remain subject in all respects to the terms of Section 5.18. The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise a third party claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any third party claim or litigation resulting therefrom within 20 days after the date it receives notice of such claim from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling such claim or litigation, after giving notice to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may deem appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.3 to the contrary, if for any reason (for example the effect of the limitations set forth in Sections 9.4 or 9.5 or evidence that an Indemnifiable Loss may be attributable to events before or after Closing) there is any uncertainty whether an Indemnifiable Claim will be for the account of the Seller Indemnitors or Purchaser, the parties will (A) cooperate in good faith to determine whether an Indemnifiable Claim will be for the account of the Seller Indemnitors or Purchaser, (B) until such uncertainty is resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties, jointly determine who will control the defense and settlement of any such Indemnifiable Claim and how such defense and settlement will be handled, (C) cooperate with each other in the defense and settlement of such Indemnifiable Claim and the exchange of information relevant thereto, (D) unless otherwise agreed, share the out- 81
of-pocket costs of such defense and settlement (including the costs of investigation, response and mitigation) equally until the parties' respective rights to indemnification for such costs are resolved, and (E) treat the defense and settlement of such Indemnifiable Claim as a joint and common defense, including any joint defense agreement which may be entered into by the parties. (ii) In the case of claims described in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 9.3(b)(i), the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnified Party shall conduct the defense in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, and shall inform the Indemnifying Party periodically, or upon the Indemnifying Party's reasonable request, of the status of the litigation. The Indemnified Party's choice of counsel shall be subject to the consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnifying Party may participate in the defense thereof, at its own expense. If, in order to preserve existing insurance for a claim against IPC currently maintained by Dynegy, it is necessary to permit Dynegy's insurer to conduct the defense of IPC, Purchaser will consider in good faith waiving or sharing its right to control such defense so that Dynegy's insurance rights are not lost, subject to the condition that the insurer accepts the tender of the claim without reservation of rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3(b), any Indemnifiable Claim relating to Hazardous Substances that is covered by Section 5.18 shall remain subject in all respect to the terms of Section 5.18. (c) Indemnification Payments on After-Tax Basis. Any indemnification payment hereunder with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss shall be an amount which is sufficient to compensate the Indemnified Party for the event giving rise to such Indemnifiable Loss (the "Indemnified Event"), after taking into account (i) all increases in federal, state, local, foreign or other Taxes payable by the Indemnified Party as a result of the receipt of such payment (excluding any increased Tax that results from the receipt of such payment causing a reduction in Tax basis or similar Tax attributes); (ii) to the extent not previously taken into account in computing the amount of such Indemnifiable Loss, all increases in federal, state, local and other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the Indemnified Party for all affected taxable years and periods as a result of the Indemnified Event; and (iii) to the extent not previously taken into account in computing the amount of such Indemnifiable Loss, all reductions in federal, state, local and foreign Taxes (including estimated Taxes) realized or realizable by the Indemnified Party as a result of the Indemnified Event and any indemnification payments made with respect thereto for all affected taxable years and periods. All calculations shall be made at the time of the relevant indemnification payment using reasonable assumptions (as agreed to by the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party) and present value concepts (using a discount rate equal to the Applicable Rate in effect at the time of the Indemnified Event using semi-annual compounding). Purchaser and Seller agree to report each indemnification payment hereunder as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal income tax purposes unless the Indemnified Party receives an opinion from nationally recognized tax counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, 82
to the effect that such reporting position is incorrect (it being understood that if any reporting position is later disallowed in any administrative or court proceedings, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for the effects of such disallowance (including any increased Tax that results from such disallowance), and it being further understood that the obligations under this parenthetical clause shall remain in effect without limitation as to time). (d) If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with respect to a potential Indemnifiable Claim or the amount thereof, the non-prevailing party in such dispute shall indemnify the prevailing party for attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in the conduct of such dispute. (e) If there shall be any conflicts between this Section 9.3 and Section 5.18, the provisions of Section 5.18 shall control. The foregoing provisions of this Section 9.3 shall not apply to any Tax Controversy. Section 9.4 Survival. The representations and warranties contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement shall expire upon the completion by the independent auditors of Purchaser of the second annual audit of Purchaser's financial statements following the Closing Date, but no later than March 31 of the pertinent year, except that the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.17, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7 shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. This Article IX shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect (a) with respect to Sections 9.1(a) and 9.2(a), so long as the relevant representations and warranties survive, (b) with respect to Sections 9.1(b) and 9.2(b) to the extent those Sections relate to the covenants requiring performance solely prior to the Closing ("Pre-Closing Covenants"), for one year after the Closing, (c) with respect to Sections 9.1(b) and 9.2(b) to the extent those Sections relate to covenants requiring performance after the Closing, so long as the applicable covenant survives, (d) with respect to Section 9.1(i), for the period provided in Schedule 5.19, and (e) with respect to all of the other provisions of this Article IX, indefinitely. Any matter as to which a non-speculative claim has been asserted in good faith by written notice in accordance with Section 9.3(a) that is pending, unresolved and being diligently pursued at the end of any applicable limitation period shall continue to be covered by this Article IX notwithstanding any applicable limitation period until such matter is finally terminated, not being diligently pursued or otherwise resolved by the parties under this Agreement or by a court of competent jurisdiction and any amounts payable hereunder are finally determined and paid. Any Indemnifiable Claim that has not been asserted against the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 9.3(a) prior to the end of any applicable limitation period shall be barred and forever waived by the Person entitled to assert such claim. Section 9.5 Limitations on Indemnification. (a) The Seller Indemnitors shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 9.1(a) unless (i) the indemnified amount that would be payable by the Seller Indemnitors with respect to any given Indemnifiable Claim exceeds $400,000 ("Seller Includable Claims"); and (ii) the aggregate amount for all Seller Includable Claims exceeds $30,000,000, and in such event, Seller Indemnitors shall be responsible for only the amount 83
in excess of $30,000,000; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations do not apply to indemnification based upon or resulting from any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.17. In no event shall the total indemnification to be paid by the Seller Indemnitors under Section 9.1(a) exceed $400,000,000; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations do not apply to indemnification based upon or resulting from any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.17. The Seller Indemnitors shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 9.1(d) unless the amount that would be payable by the Seller Indemnitors with respect to any given Indemnifiable Claim exceeds $400,000. (b) Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section 9.2(a) unless (i) the indemnified amount that would be payable by Purchaser with respect to any given Indemnifiable Claim exceeds $400,000 ("Purchaser Includable Claims"); and (ii) the aggregate amount for all Purchaser Includable Claims exceeds $30,000,000, and in such event, Purchaser shall be responsible for only the amount in excess of $30,000,000; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations do not apply to indemnification based upon or resulting from any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7. In no event shall the total indemnification to be paid by Purchaser under Section 9.2(a) exceed $400,000,000; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations do not apply to indemnification based upon or resulting from any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7. (c) Any Indemnifiable Claim with respect to any breach or nonperformance by any party of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall be limited to the amount of actual Indemnifiable Losses sustained by the Indemnified Party by reason of such breach or nonperformance, net of any insurance or other proceeds received by the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to require or permit the payment by the Indemnifying Party of duplicative, in whole or in part, indemnity payments hereunder to an Indemnified Party. (d) If an inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by Dynegy or Seller, or a breach of any of the covenants of Dynegy or Seller, gives rise to an adjustment in the Purchase Price or is otherwise addressed in some other provision of this Agreement, then such inaccuracy or breach shall not give rise to an indemnification obligation under Section 9.1. (e) If any Indemnifiable Claim is based upon or resulting from any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties and is also subject to indemnification under Sections 9.1(b) through (i), the provisions of this Section 9.5 applicable to inaccuracies in any representation or warranty shall be inapplicable to such Indemnifiable Claim. (f) If any Indemnifiable Claim is based upon or resulting from any breach or inaccuracy in Section 3.19(a), Dynegy shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to contribute and deliver, or cause to be contributed and delivered, within 30 days after notice with respect to such Indemnifiable Claim has been delivered in accordance with Section 9.3(a), such assets as are required to cure (in whole or in 84
part) such breach or inaccuracy. In the event Dynegy makes such election and fails for whatever reason to cure (in whole or in part) such breach or inaccuracy, in no event shall such failure be deemed a breach or non performance of a covenant or obligation of any Dynegy Party, and Purchaser shall be entitled to pursue any remedy available to it with respect to the original breach or inaccuracy of Section 3.19(a) to the extent such breach or inaccuracy remains uncured. Section 9.6 Mitigation. Each potential Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to address any claims or liabilities in the same manner it would respond to such claims or liabilities in the absence of the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any party shall willfully fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any Indemnifiable Loss that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if such party had made such efforts. Section 9.7 Remedies Exclusive. Except as otherwise provided in Article VII, the remedies provided for in this Article IX shall be exclusive and shall preclude assertion by any Indemnified Party of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against the Indemnifying Party for claims based on this Agreement, other than fraud. In no event shall the mere breach of a representation or warranty be deemed to constitute bad faith, misconduct or fraud. Each party hereby waives any provision of Law to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this Section 9.7. Section 9.8 Tax Indemnification Matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article IX, the above provisions of Article IX shall not apply to Income Tax indemnification matters, which matters shall instead by governed by Article VII. Section 9.9 Qualification as to Materiality. The following occurrences as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not be disregarded in the application of Section 9.1(a): (i) in the fifth sentence of Section 3.5; (ii) in the phrase "fairly presents in all material respects" in Section 3.6; and (iii) clause (ii) of Section 3.7(a) and the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" as used in such clause. The requirement to disregard qualifications as to materiality and Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to modify or eliminate any dollar amount specifically stated in this Agreement or any concept of materiality that is embodied in any requirement of Law or in GAAP. ARTICLE X TERMINATION AND WAIVER Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated as to all parties at any time prior to the Closing: (a) by the mutual written consent of Dynegy and Purchaser; or (b) by either Dynegy or Purchaser, by written notice to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2004 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1 shall not be 85

Subject to Section 8.2(b), as used in this Agreement, the term "material" (except with regard to material compliance) and the concept of the "material" nature of an effect upon the IPC Assets, the Business or the IPC Companies shall be measured relative to the IPC Assets, the Business and the IPC Companies at the time of such measurement. Despite the fact that there are items that have been included in the Schedules and may be included elsewhere in this Agreement, the inclusion of such items shall not be deemed to be an agreement by Seller that such items are "material" or to further define the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Section 11.4 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement are arranged corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Agreement, but the terms of this Agreement and disclosures in any Schedules shall qualify any other applicable representation and warranty provision of this Agreement (whether or not qualified by a Schedule) to the extent the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent based on the facts specified in such matters described.

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. Section 11.9 Entire Agreement. Except with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement (which shall survive in accordance with its terms except as otherwise specified in 90
Section 5.6), this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Section 11.10 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party, by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of such other party); provided, however, that Purchaser may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a Subsidiary of Purchaser; provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11.10 shall be void. In the event any party (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in any such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of such party shall assume the obligations set forth in this Agreement. Section 11.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Section 11.12 Amendment. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by and to the extent set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the parties. Section 11.13 Waiver.

Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if, and to the extent, set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of such rights. Section 11.14 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state. All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any New York state or federal court sitting in the City of New York, and the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding.

News Release One Ameren Plaza 1901 Chouteau Avenue St. Louis, MO 63103 [Ameren logo] NEWS RELEASE Contacts: Media: Analysts: Investors: Susan Gallagher Bruce Steinke Investor Services (314) 554-2175 (314) 554-2574 invest@ameren.com AMEREN REACHES AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE ILLINOIS POWER COMPANY, UPDATES EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 3, 2004---Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase the stock of Decatur, Ill.-based Illinois Power Company and a 20 percent interest in Electric Energy, Inc. (EEI) from Dynegy Inc.(NYSE: DYN). In a transaction valued at $2.3 billion, Ameren will assume approximately $1.8 billion in Illinois Power (IP) debt and preferred stock, and pay the balance in cash at closing. However, Ameren will place $100 million of the cash portion of the purchase price in a six-year escrow unless certain conditions are met prior to closing. "With Ameren's and IP's service territories being contiguous---even intertwined, this acquisition is an excellent strategic fit for our core electric and natural gas delivery businesses," said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman and chief executive officer of Ameren. "This acquisition will bring solid long-term growth for our company. In addition, it will enhance our ability to continue to deliver low-cost, high-quality service to the nearly two million electric and gas customers we will serve in the state of Illinois after the acquisition is completed." Ameren expects this acquisition to be accretive by 5 to 10 cents per share in the first year after the transaction closes. Ameren's financing plan for this transaction includes the issuance of new Ameren common stock, which in total, is expected to equal at least 50 percent of the transaction value. Proceeds will be used to pay the cash portion of the acquisition price to Dynegy, reduce certain IP debt and pay related premiums after closing and/or reduce current and future debt at Ameren. Consistent with its acquisition of CILCORP Inc., completed in January of 2003, Ameren could issue some, or all, of the common stock for this acquisition prior to the close of the transaction. Some portion of the common stock could be issued in the near future. Warner L. Baxter, Ameren executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, "We expect this acquisition to be meaningfully accretive to earnings in the first year after closing and to provide significant long-term value for all our stakeholders. Consistent with our past practice, we will conservatively finance this acquisition in order to immediately strengthen the financial profile of IP and at the same time maintain Ameren's already strong credit profile and dividend." - more -
Add One IP's principal assets are its transmission and distribution systems. IP currently serves approximately 590,000 electric and 415,000 natural gas customers in Illinois. As noted, the purchase also includes Dynegy's 20 percent interest in EEI--the owner of a 1,086-megawatt, Joppa, Ill.-based coal-fired power plant --- a plant which has some of the lowest operating costs in the United States. Through its subsidiaries, Ameren is already the owner of 60 percent of EEI. This transaction also includes a firm capacity power supply contract for the annual purchase by IP of 2,800 megawatts of electricity from Dynegy. That contract extends through 2006 and is expected to supply about 75 percent of IP electric customer requirements. Because bundled retail electric rates are frozen at current levels in Illinois through 2006, the transaction would not have an immediate impact on retail electric rates paid by customers of IP or other Ameren subsidiaries. Upon closing of the acquisition, expected by year-end 2004, IP would become an Ameren subsidiary, operating as AmerenIP, and would continue to be headquartered in Decatur, Ill. Through its operating companies in Illinois, Ameren currently serves more than 970,000 electric and natural gas customers and has approximately 3,200 employees in the state. With this acquisition, more than 60 percent of Ameren's total customer base would reside in Illinois. The transaction was approved by the board of directors of each company. The transaction is also subject to the approval of the Illinois Commerce Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. No approval is required from shareholders of either company. Ameren will not propose any legislation to complete this acquisition. Ameren also outlined its commitments to the communities IP serves: - -- First, Ameren will immediately contribute a total of $300,000 to the Decatur and other IP service area United Way organizations. This contribution is intended to help ease the current financial difficulty many social service and community-based organizations are experiencing due to recent decreased funding. In addition, upon closing the transaction, Ameren will commit to the following: - -- The headquarters of IP would remain in Decatur for not less than five years. - -- IP work force reductions resulting from the acquisition would not exceed 25 employees for a period of four years, except to the extent such additional reductions occur through attrition or voluntary separation programs. - -- IP employees and retirees and those retirees' surviving dependents would remain in their current IP benefit plans or be moved into appropriate Ameren plans, and AmerenIP would honor all existing labor agreements. - more -
Add Two - -- Based upon the company's preliminary analysis, Ameren would commit between $275 million and $325 million in energy infrastructure investments over its first two years of ownership. - -- Ameren would increase total contributions to United Way, civic, charitable and social service organizations in IP's service territory to at least $1.5 million annually. - -- Ameren has a strong track record of supporting economic development throughout its service areas. Ameren would commit additional resources to support and enhance economic development aimed at attracting new jobs in the IP service territory. Rainwater said that these commitments respond to concerns expressed during the Illinois Legislature's fall veto session, including those voiced by the Hon. Paul Osborne, mayor of Decatur; House Speaker Michael J. Madigan (D-22nd District); Sen. Frank C. Watson (R-51st District); Rep. Eileen Lyons (R-82nd District); State Representative Robert F. Flider (D-101st District); and Sen. Patrick Welch (D-38th District). "As we listened to community leaders, we grew even more aware of the economic and social impact that Illinois Power has on Decatur and the areas IP serves," says Rainwater. "Following our recent acquisition of CILCORP Inc. from The AES Corporation, we demonstrated that our company acts responsibly and lives up to its commitments. We take our commitments to the IP service territory just as seriously." Ameren also announced today that it was reaffirming its 2003 ongoing (non-GAAP) earnings guidance range of between $2.90 and $3.00 per share. "Despite mild weather in the fourth quarter, we expect to be solidly within our previously announced guidance range," noted Baxter. The 2003 estimate excludes the previously announced gains of 11 cents per share associated with the adoption of a new accounting standard, related to the recognition of asset retirement obligations, and 19 cents per share for a coal mine reclamation settlement. The comparable 2003 GAAP earnings guidance range, which includes these unusual gains, is $3.20 to $3.30 per share. The company currently expects to report 2003 earnings on Feb. 10. The company also announced that its 2004 earnings are expected to range between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. The 2004 estimate excludes the potential impact of the IP acquisition and related common stock issuances. The company's guidance is subject to, among other things, plant operations, weather conditions, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in the company's Forward-Looking Statements. Baxter added, "Factors impacting 2004 earnings include, among other things, solid organic growth in the company's service territory, almost $30 million in gas rate increases for all of Ameren's gas operations, incremental synergies from the CILCORP acquisition and continued cost control. Offsetting these benefits, in part, will be the implementation of a $30 million reduction in electric revenues in Missouri in April 2004, a - more -
Add Three scheduled Callaway Nuclear Plant refueling outage in the spring of 2004 and rising employee benefit costs. We remain on target with our plan to deliver two to three percent earnings growth in 2004, over a normalized 2003 earnings base." Ameren was advised on this transaction by Goldman, Sachs & Co.

ABOUT THE COMPANIES: - -------------------- AMEREN CORPORATION: A $13.5-billion-asset company based in St. Louis, Mo., Ameren Corporation provides energy services to 1.7 million electric and 500,000 natural gas customers over 49,000 square miles in Illinois and Missouri. Among the nation's top utility companies in size and sales, Ameren's regulated companies -- AmerenCILCO, AmerenCIPS and AmerenUE -- were founded more than a century ago as Central Illinois Light Company, Central Illinois Public Service Company and Union Electric Company, respectively. ILLINOIS POWER COMPANY: Illinois Power, based in Decatur, Ill., serves 590,000 electric and 415,000 natural gas customers in a 15,000 square-mile territory across Illinois. The company was founded more than 75 years ago and its parent company--Illinova--was purchased in 2000 by Houston, Texas-based Dynegy Inc. - a provider of electricity, natural gas and natural gas liquids to wholesale customers. Dynegy owns and operates a diverse portfolio of energy assets, including power plants totaling approximately 13,000 megawatts of net generating capacity, gas processing plants that process more than 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day and approximately 40,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines.
Forward-Looking Statements Statements made in this release, which are not based on historical facts, are "forward-looking" and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed. Although such "forward-looking" statements have been made in good faith and are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that the expected results will be achieved. These statements include (without limitation) statements as to future expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, events, conditions, and financial performance. In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the company is providing this cautionary statement to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. The following factors, in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this release and in past and subsequent securities filings, could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations as suggested by such "forward-looking" statements: - the timing of Ameren's acquisition of IP and the impact of any conditions imposed by regulators in connection with their approval thereof; - the effects of the stipulation and agreement relating to the AmerenUE Missouri electric excess earnings complaint case and other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory policy; - changes in laws and other governmental actions, including monetary and fiscal policy; - the impact on the company of current regulations related to the opportunity for customers to choose alternative energy suppliers in Illinois; - the effects of increased competition in the future due to, among other things, deregulation of certain aspects of the company's business at both the state and federal levels; - the effects of participation in a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-approved regional transmission organization, including activities associated with the Midwest Independent System Operator; - the availability of fuel for the production of electricity, such as coal and natural gas, and purchased power and natural gas for distribution, and the level and volatility of future market prices for such commodities, including the ability to recover any increased costs; - the use of financial and derivative instruments; - average rates for electricity in the Midwest; - business and economic conditions; - the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards and the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance; - interest rates and the availability of capital; - actions of ratings agencies and the effects of such actions; weather conditions; generation plant construction, installation and performance; operation of nuclear power facilities and decommissioning costs; - the effects of strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and divestitures; - the impact of current environmental regulations on utilities and generating companies and the expectation that more stringent requirements will be introduced over time, which could potentially have a negative financial effect; - future wages and employee benefits costs, including changes in returns on benefit plan assets; - disruptions of the capital markets or other events making the company's access to necessary capital more difficult or costly; o competition from other generating facilities, including new facilities that may be developed; difficulties in integrating AmerenCILCO and IP with the company's other businesses; - changes in the coal markets, environmental laws or regulations, or other factors adversely impacting synergy assumptions in connection with the CILCORP Inc. and IP acquisitions; - cost and availability of transmission capacity for the energy generated by the company's generating facilities or required to satisfy energy sales made by the company; and legal and administrative proceedings. # # #
