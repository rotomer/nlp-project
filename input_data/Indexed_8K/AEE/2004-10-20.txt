Following the partial redemption of the Bonds, $357,500,000 aggregate principal amount of Bonds will remain outstanding and are eligible to participate in the tender offer. The purchase price will be determined, as described in the Offer to Purchase, in accordance with standard market practice by reference to a yield of 50 basis points over the yield on the 2.625% U.S. Treasury Note due Nov. 15, 2006, on the price determination date.
