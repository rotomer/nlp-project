Any attempt to sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Restricted Shares or any right or privilege pertaining thereto, otherwise than by transfer to a trust pursuant to Section 16 hereof, shall be null and void and of no force and effect. Upon the lapse of the Restrictions with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to this Award, Grantee shall obtain a vested right to such shares of Common Stock.
 
4.
 
Vesting
. Except as otherwise provided in section 5, 7 or 12, the Restrictions shall lapse with respect to the Restricted Shares only to the extent certain performance criteria are achieved and Grantee achieves a certain ownership level of Common Stock.
 
(a)
 
Annual Vesting
. Subject to subsection 4(c) hereof, for each Performance Year, the Restrictions shall lapse with respect to the number of Restricted Shares equal to the lesser of (i) the Annual Eligible Vesting Amount, or (ii) the Remaining Shares. As of the Determination Date after the end of each Performance Year, the Committee shall calculate the number of Restricted Shares which shall become Vested Shares in accordance with the foregoing formula provided the Ownership Level requirement of subsection 4(c) is achieved. Fractional shares of Common Stock shall be rounded to the nearest whole share (for which purpose one-half share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share). Target Shares for a Performance Year in which the Performance Rating is less than the Threshold Level shall be forfeited as of the end of such Performance Year (without payment of consideration by the Company) (Forfeited Shares). Vesting under this Section shall continue after Grantees termination of employment on or after attainment of age 65, except if such termination is by the Company for Cause. Vesting under this Section shall cease upon Grantees termination of employment for any reason before age 65 or by the Company for Cause.
 
(b)
 
Accelerated Vesting
. Subject to subsection 4(c) hereof, if, as of the Determination Date following the end of the third Performance Year, the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the accelerated performance vesting criteria set forth on
Schedule B
have been achieved, the Restrictions shall lapse with respect to all Restricted Shares subject to this Agreement except for Forfeited Shares. Vesting under this Section shall continue after Grantees termination of employment on or after attainment of age 65, except if such termination is by the Company for Cause. Vesting under this Section shall cease upon Grantees termination of employment for any reason before age 65 or by the Company for Cause.
 
 
4
(c)
 
Ownership Level Requirements
.
(i)
 
Pre-Age 65
. Prior to the date on which Grantee attains age 65, the Restrictions shall not lapse with respect to the Restricted Shares eligible for vesting pursuant to subsection 4(a) or 4(b) hereof unless Grantee has achieved his or her requisite Ownership Level as of the Determination Date immediately following the Performance Year in which such Restricted Shares have become eligible for vesting pursuant to subsection 4(a) or 4(b) hereof. For each Performance Year, the Ownership Level shall be deemed to have been achieved only if Grantee maintains the requisite Ownership Level as of the Determination Date immediately following such Performance Year. If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that Grantee has not achieved the Ownership Level as of the relevant Determination Date, the Restricted Shares which would otherwise have vested pursuant to subsection 4(a) or 4(b) hereof if not for the Ownership Level requirement shall not be forfeited, but shall remain subject to the Restrictions until and unless the requisite Ownership Level has been achieved as of a future Determination Date. However, unless subsection 4(c)(ii) or section 5(b) hereof shall apply, such Restricted Shares shall be forfeited (without payment of consideration by the Company) in accordance with subsection 5(d) and section 6 hereof if the requisite Ownership Level is not achieved as of the last Determination Date immediately preceding termination of employment.
(ii)
 
Age 65
. If, and when, Grantee attains age 65 while employed by the Company, the Ownership Level requirements set forth in subsection 4(c)(i) hereof shall no longer serve as a condition to vesting. Consequently, at such time, the Restrictions shall lapse with respect to the Restricted Shares which have become eligible for vesting pursuant to subsection 4(a) or (4)(b) hereof but which have not become Vested Shares solely because of Grantees failure to achieve the requisite Ownership Level. Thereafter, the Restrictions with respect to the Restricted Shares which satisfy the vesting criteria set forth in subsection 4(a) or 4(b) hereof shall lapse irrespective of the Ownership Level requirements of subsection 4(c)(i) hereof.
(iii)
 
Exception
. The vesting restrictions of this Section 4.4(c) shall not apply to any shares which vest under the second to last sentence of Section 4(a) or 4(b).
5.
 
Vesting of Restricted Shares Upon Termination of Employment for any Reason Other Than Termination by the Company for Cause
.
(a)
 
Irrespective of the Ownership Level requirement, if Grantees employment is terminated before age 65 for any reason other than termination by the Company for Cause, the Restrictions with respect to the number of Restricted Shares equal to the lesser of (i) the Pro Rata Vesting Amount, or (ii) the Pro Rata Remaining Shares shall lapse as of the Determination Date immediately following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs.
(b)
 
Unless otherwise vested pursuant to subsection 5(a) hereof, if Grantees employment is terminated on account of Death, Disability, Normal Retirement or termination by the Company without Cause, Restricted Shares which would have vested pursuant to subsection 4(a) or 4(b) hereof, but have not yet vested because of Grantees failure to achieve the requisite Ownership Level pursuant to subsection 4(c) hereof, shall vest as of such Termination Date.
(c)
 
Irrespective of the Ownership Level requirement, if such Termination Date occurs prior to, or on, the Determination Date immediately following the end of the third Performance Year, and Grantees employment is terminated for any reason before age 65 other than termination by the Company for Cause, Grantee shall be eligible to vest in an additional number of Restricted Shares provided the Committee
 
 
 
5
 
determines, in its sole discretion, that the accelerated vesting performance criteria set forth on
Schedule B
have been achieved. If the Committee determines that the accelerated vesting performance criteria set forth on
Schedule B
have been achieved, the Restrictions shall lapse with respect to an additional number of Restricted Shares equal to the product of (a) the number of Restricted Shares which have neither vested nor been forfeited as of the Determination Date immediately following the end of the third Performance Year, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the denominator of which shall be 1,095, and the numerator of which shall be the number of days Grantee worked during the Seven-Year Performance Period prior to the Termination Date. In the event the Termination Date occurs on or before the Determination Date immediately following the end of the third Performance Year, Restricted Shares which shall vest pursuant to either subsection 5(a) or 5(b) hereof shall be deemed to have previously vested for purposes of this section 5(c) hereof.
(d)
 
Any Restricted Shares in excess of the Restricted Shares which have vested pursuant to Sections 4 or 7 or subsections 5(a), 5(b) or 5(c) hereof shall be forfeited to the Company without payment of consideration by the Company as soon as such Restricted Shares have no possibility of vesting under Sections 4 or 5.
6.
 
Termination for Cause
. Grantee shall forfeit (without payment of consideration by the Company) all Restricted Shares with respect to which the Restrictions have not lapsed upon the occurrence of a termination of Grantees employment by the Company for Cause.
7.
 
Change of Control
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control prior to Grantees Termination Date, the Restrictions shall lapse with respect to the number of Restricted Shares which have neither vested nor been forfeited prior to the Change of Control, irrespective of whether Grantee has achieved the requisite Ownership Level as of the date of such Change of Control.
8.
 
Custody, Voting and Dividends
. Restricted Shares shall be held in book-entry form by the Company or its agent for Grantees account, with appropriate notation of the Restrictions made in the custodians records.
Additionally, the grant of Restricted Shares is conditioned upon Grantees endorsement in blank of the irrevocable stock power attached to the Grant Notice as Exhibit B. The irrevocable stock power must be endorsed and returned to the Vice President of Human Resources within sixty (60) days from the Date of Grant. Failure to do so within the prescribed time period will result in an immediate forfeiture of the Restricted Shares.
Dividends declared on Restricted Shares shall be reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock (in accordance with such methods or procedures as shall be established from time to time by the Committee), which shall vest concurrently with the Restricted Shares. To the extent the Restricted Shares have not been forfeited, Grantee shall be entitled to voting privileges associated with the Restricted Shares.
 
9.
 
Lapse of Restrictions
. If, and when, the Restrictions lapse, the Company shall distribute such Vested Shares into a separate book-entry account, which will not bear any restrictive legend. Additionally, the Company will deliver to Grantee no later than thirty (30) days following the lapse of such Restrictions the related irrevocable stock power held by the Company pursuant to section 8 hereof.
 
10.
 
Committee Discretion
. This Award has been made pursuant to a determination made by the Committee. The Committee shall have plenary authority to (a) interpret any provision of this Award, (b) make any determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of this Award, and (c) waive any conditions or rights under this Award, or amend, alter, accelerate, suspend, discontinue or terminate this Award; provided, however, that, except as provided in section 11 hereof, without the consent of Grantee, no such amendment,
 
 
 
6
 
alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination of this Award may impair the rights of Grantee under this Award.
 
11.
 
Adjustments
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that the Committee shall determine that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or share exchange, or other similar corporate transaction or event, affects the Restricted Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Grantee under this Award, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, make any adjustments to this Award it deems appropriate. In addition, the Committee is authorized to make such adjustments as it deems appropriate in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, the Award in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence) affecting the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate or the financial statements of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles.
 
12.
 
Tax Withholding
.
 
Upon the lapse of the Restrictions (or any such earlier time, if any, that an election is made under Section 83(b) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, to include the value of such shares in taxable income), the Company shall be entitled to withhold from Grantees compensation any required taxes, including Grantees social security and Medicare taxes and federal, state and local income tax with respect to the income arising from the lapse of the Restrictions. The Company shall have the right to require the payment of any such taxes before delivering the stock certificate with respect to the Vested Shares and the related stock power held by the Company in accordance with section 8 hereof. Alternatively, in lieu of such withholding, Grantee shall be entitled to cover all or any part of the taxes arising from the lapse of the Restrictions through a reduction of the number of Vested Shares delivered to Grantee or a delivery, or tender, to the Company of shares of Common Stock already held by Grantee, in each case valued in the same manner as used in computing withholding taxes under the applicable laws. Additionally, to the extent it is determined by a regulatory agency or a court of competent jurisdiction that shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be considered Restricted Shares pursuant to the terms of this Award nevertheless result in current federal or state taxation, (i) all Restrictions as to such shares shall immediately lapse, (ii) such Shares shall immediately become Vested Shares and (iii) Grantee shall be entitled to cover all or any part of the taxes through a reduction of such Restricted Shares resulting in the taxable event.
 
13.
 
Beneficiary Designations
. Grantee shall file with the Vice President of Human Resources on the form attached to the Grant Notice as
Exhibit C
, or such other form as may be prescribed by the Company, a designation of a primary beneficiary(ies) and a contingent beneficiary(ies) to whom shares of Common Stock otherwise due to Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be distributed in the event of the death of Grantee prior to distribution. Grantee shall have the right to change the beneficiary from time to time; provided, however, that any change shall not become effective until received in writing by the secretary of the Company or its designee. If any designated beneficiary survives Grantee but dies before receiving all of Grantees benefits hereunder to which he or she is entitled, any remaining benefits due Grantee to which the deceased beneficiary is entitled shall be distributed to the deceased beneficiarys estate. If there is no effective beneficiary designation on file at the time of Grantees death, or if the designated primary beneficiary(ies) and contingent beneficiary(ies) predecease Grantee, the payment of benefits shall be made to Grantees estate.
 
14.
 
No Right to Continued Employment
. Nothing in this Award shall be deemed to create any limitation or restriction on such rights as the Company otherwise would have to terminate the employment of Grantee at any time for any reason.
 
7
15.
 
Governing Law
. To the extent federal law does not otherwise control, the validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Award shall be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws thereof.
 
16.
 
Successors and Assigns
. The provisions of this Award shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns, and Grantee and, to the extent applicable, Grantees legal representative. Grantee may transfer Restricted Shares to the trustee of a trust only to the extent approved in advance by the Committee (or its designee), in its sole discretion, and the Restricted Shares are held by such trustee subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in this Award. Furthermore, as a condition to transfer, the Committee (or its designee) shall have the authority to require the trustee to execute any documentation deemed appropriate by the Committee (or its designee) to ensure the Restricted Shares will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Award.
 
17.

Exhibit 10.2
 
[Missing Graphic Reference]
The Ameren Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) is intended to reward contributions to Amerens shareholder value.
PLAN PARTICIPATION
All applicable members of the Ameren Leadership Team are eligible to participate in the EIP.
PLAN FUNDING
Plan funding is the total amount of incentive money available to award. The plan is funded based on the achievement of Ameren Corporations earnings per share (EPS) for the plan year (achievement levels may be adjusted to reflect refunds and rate changes under regulatory sharing plans or other extraordinary one-time events). Three levels of EPS achievement will be established to reward participants for progress achieved in overall EPS performance. Achievement of EPS falling between the established levels will be interpolated. The three levels are defined as:
BONUS AWARD OPPORTUNITIES
Annual bonus award opportunity percentages are set by the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors.
PERFORMANCE COMPONENT WEIGHTINGS
There are two performance components (or measures) of the plan: EPS and Business Line KPIs/Individual. The performance components are the measures used to determine a bonus award pay-out. Each component is weighted. This weight indicates how much of the available funding will be available for each component.
Exhibit 10.2
The weightings for the 2005 plan are:
EPS 
 
 
   
 
50%
Business Line KPIs/Individual      
 
50%
EPS:
   This component is the corporate level of measurement; Amerens earnings per share achievement. Fifty percent of the available bonus funds will be available for payment to each executive based on corporate success.
Business Line/Individual:
   Each executive will have 50% of their available bonus determined by the success of their individual contributions. The success of their respective business line or functions compensation KPIs will be used as the basis of the assessment.
PLAN PAYMENT
Awards will be paid by 3/15/2006. The bonus award percentage will be based on each executives base salary as of 12/31/2005. Payment will be prorated for participants who become eligible after 1/1/2005 or who retire, die or become disabled during 2005. The salary basis for those who retire, die or become disabled will be as of the date of retirement, death or disability.
The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors will approve the final amount of payment upon recommendation of the CEO of Ameren Corporation.
