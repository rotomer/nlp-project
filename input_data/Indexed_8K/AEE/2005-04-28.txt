FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 St. Louis, Mo., Apr. 28, 2005 --- Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced first quarter 2005 net income of $121
   
milli
on, or 62 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2004 net income of $97 million, or
55
cents per share.
 
 We are off to a solid start in 2005, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Ameren Corporation. Our net earnings in the first quarter of 2005 benefited from higher prices for interchange power sales, the addition of Illinois Power Company and improved availability and capacity factors at our power plants. Milder winter weather, reduced emission credit sales and higher fuel costs offset some of the positive factors this year.
   
 
 Revenues in the first quarter of 2005 increased to $1.6 billion from $1.2 billion in 2004. The September 2004 acquisition of Illinois Power Company added electric revenues of $235 million and gas revenues of $197 million over the first quarter of 2004. Interchange revenues increased by $14 million over the prior year to $113 million in the first three months of 2005 with revenues of almost $38 per megawatthour versus approximately $31 per megawatthour in the first three months of 2004. As part of Amerens overall environmental compliance strategy, there were no emission credit sales in the first quarter of 2005 versus sales of $15 million in the same period a year ago.
   
 
 Excluding the effect of the Illinois Power Company acquisition, weather-sensitive residential and commercial electric megawatthour sales were down 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2005, compared to 2004. Heating degree days in the first quarter of 2005 were approximately 4 percent below the mild year-ago period in Amerens service territory. Excluding the effect of the Illinois Power Company acquisition, industrial electric megawatthour

sales in the first quarter were down 6 percent in 2005 versus the year-ago period due to the expiration and non-renewal of low-margin power sales contracts.
 
 Operating expenses rose $361 million in the first quarter of 2005, compared to the year-ago period. This increase was principally due to the acquisition of Illinois Power Company, which added $388 million in operating expenses in 2005. In addition, fuel costs rose in the first quarter of 2005 over 2004, principally at the companys coal-fired generating plants. These cost increases were offset, in part, by lower purchased power costs due to increased availability of our power plants and lower industrial sales.
   
 
 Illinois Power Company contributed net income of $21 million to Amerens earnings in the first quarter of 2005. After considering the additional common shares issued to fund the Illinois Power Company acquisition, the transaction was accretive to Amerens earnings by 3 cents per share in the first quarter of 2005, consistent with the companys expectations. The acquisition of Illinois Power Company was accretive by 7 cents per share to Amerens earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004.
   
 
 The integration of Illinois Power is well underway, noted Rainwater. Late last year, 230 Illinois Power employees accepted a voluntary separation opportunity. Those employees will leave the company throughout 2005. In addition, we reorganized our entire Illinois operations in the first quarter. In early April, we converted some key financial systems and expect to convert the remaining systems, including customer service systems, later this year. In addition, as part of our recapitalization of Illinois Power beginning late last year, we contributed equity to Illinois Power and reduced high-cost debt by $770 million. These actions have resulted in significant interest expense savings and have helped raise Illinois Powers credit ratings to solid investment-grade categories. We are executing our integration plan very well and remain on track for achieving expected synergies and earnings contributions from this acquisition.
   
 
 Ameren also announced today that it is reaffirming that its 2005 earnings are expected to range between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. Amerens guidance assumes normal weather and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.
   
 
 Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Thursday, April 28, 2005, to discuss first quarter 2005 earnings and other matters related to the company. Investors, the news media and the public may listen to a live Internet broadcast of the

This presentation will be posted in the Investors section of the site under presentations and will be provided in a .pdf format.

 With assets of more than $17 billion, Ameren serves approximately 2.3 million electric customers and more than 900,000 natural gas customers in a 64,000 square mile area of Missouri and Illinois. Ameren owns a diverse mix of electric generating plants strategically located in its Midwest market with a generating capacity of more than 15,000 megawatts.
   
 
Regulation G
 
 In addition to presenting electric revenues and statistics on a consolidated basis, Ameren has presented electric revenues and statistics for the first three months of 2005, excluding Illinois Power Company. Ameren believes this information is useful because it enables readers to compare results between periods without giving effect to the Illinois Power Company acquisition that was completed in September 2004.
