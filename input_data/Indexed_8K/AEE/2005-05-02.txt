       Effective May 1, 2005, a subordinated promissory note issued by Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco), an indirect subsidiary of Ameren Corporation (Ameren), to Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), a direct subsidiary of Ameren, as consideration for CIPS transfer of its electric generating assets and related liabilities to Genco on May 1, 2000, was amended to extend its maturity from May 1, 2005 to May 1, 2010. A brief description of the terms and conditions of the amended promissory note is included under Item 2.03 below and the text of the amended note dated as of May 1, 2005 is included as Exhibit 4.1.
 
        On May 2, 2005, the following material definitive agreements were entered into in conjunction with the intercompany asset transfers discussed under Item 8.01 below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
SECTION 2 - - FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
ITEM 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
        On May 1, 2000, Genco issued to CIPS a subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of approximately $552 million (the Original Genco Note) as consideration for CIPS transfer of its electric generating assets and related liabilities to Genco on that date. The asset transfer agreement between CIPS and Genco, dated as of May 1, 2000, was filed as Exhibit 10 to CIPS Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2000. The Original Genco Note had a 7 percent interest rate, a 10-year amortization schedule and a maturity date of May 1, 2005. The Original Genco Note was subordinated to all senior debt of Genco. As of April 30, 2005, the principal amount outstanding under the Original Genco Note was approximately
$
249 million
.
Effective May 1, 2005, Genco amended certain terms of the Original Genco Note by the issuance to CIPS of an amended and restated subordinated promissory note (Exhibit 4.1 hereto) in the
 
principal amount of approximately $249 million with an interest rate of 7.125 percent per annum, a 5-year amortization schedule and a maturity date of May 1, 2010 and with terms of subordination identical to the Original Genco Note.
 
        On May 2, 2005, pursuant to the terms of the UE Illinois Asset Transfer Agreement (Exhibit 10.1 hereto), CIPS issued to UE a subordinated promissory note (Exhibit 4.2 hereto) in the principal amount of approximately $69 million as consideration for approximately 50 percent of the transferred assets. The subordinated promissory note bears interest at 4.70 percent per annum and has a 10-year amortization schedule and a maturity date of May 2, 2010. With the consent of UE, CIPS may prepay the promissory note in whole or in part without premium or penalty. The promissory note is subordinated to all senior debt of CIPS. A brief description of the transaction is included under Item 8.01 below.

SECTION 8 - - OTHER EVENTS
 
Item 8.01  Other Events.
 
        On May 2, 2005, following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, UE completed the transfer of its Illinois-based electric and natural gas utility businesses, including its Illinois-based distribution assets, certain of its transmission assets and approximately 100 employees, at an estimated net book value of $138 million, to its affiliate, CIPS. Under the terms of the UE Illinois Asset Transfer Agreement (Exhibit 10.1 hereto), the net book value will be adjusted within 60 days after the May 2 closing to reflect the actual net book value of the transferred assets as of the closing date. UEs electric generating facilities and a certain insignificant amount of its electric transmission and communications facilities in Illinois were not part of the transfer. Pursuant to the UE Illinois Asset Transfer Agreement, UE transferred 50 percent of the assets directly to CIPS in consideration for a CIPS subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of approximately $69 million (discussed under Item 2.03 above) and 50 percent of the assets by means of a dividend in kind to Ameren, followed by a capital contribution by Ameren to CIPS. With the completion of this transfer, UE no longer operates as a public utility subject to Illinois Commerce Commission regulation and limits its public utility operations exclusively to the state of Missouri.
 
        Also on May 2, 2005, following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, Genco completed the transfer to UE of its 232 megawatt combustion turbine electric generating station located in Kinmundy, Illinois, for an estimated net book value of $91 million, and its 320 megawatt combustion turbine electric generating station located in Pinckneyville, Illinois, for an estimated net book value of $150 million. Under the terms of each asset transfer agreement (Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 hereto), the net book value will be adjusted within 90 days after the closing to reflect the actual net book value of the transferred assets as of the closing date. The transfer of these electric generating assets satisfies the remainder of UEs commitment under its 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement to add 700 megawatts of generation capacity by June 30, 2006. UE added 240 megawatts of generation capacity in 2002 in partial satisfaction of this commitment.
 
        For additional information, reference is made to the press release dated May 2, 2005, which is included as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Any instrument defining the terms of any Senior Debt
may include subordination provisions in respect of this Note and, in such case, in the event of

In its defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall timely provide the indemnified party with such information with respect to such defense, compromise or settlement as the indemnified party shall request, and shall not assume any position or take any action that would impose an obligation of any kind on, or restrict the actions of, the indemnified party.

(c)

Transferor has good, marketable and exclusive title to, and the valid and enforceable power and unqualified right to use and transfer to Transferee, each of the Acquired Assets, and the Acquired Assets are free and clear of all Liens and Claims of any kind or nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens.

Transferor has the right under valid and existing leases to occupy, use or control all properties and assets leased by it and included in the Acquired Assets. The delivery to Transferee of the instruments of transfer of ownership contemplated by this Agreement will vest good, marketable and exclusive title (as to all Acquired Assets owned by Transferor) or full right to possess and use (as to all Acquired Assets not owned by Transferor) to the Acquired Assets in Transferee, free and clear of all Liens and Claims of any kind or nature whatsoever, except for (i) current real estate Taxes or governmental charges or levies which are a Lien but not yet due and payable, (ii) Liens disclosed as securing specified liabilities on the Closing Date Balance Sheet with respect to which no default exists, (iii) Liens disclosed on Schedule 5.1(c) (Title to the Acquired Assets), under the heading "Liens," and (iv) minor imperfections of title, if any, none of which are substantial in amount, or materially detract from the value or impair the use of the property subject thereto or the operation of the Plant and which have arisen only in the ordinary and normal course of business consistent with past practice (the Liens described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being collectively referred to herein as "Permitted Liens").

(c)
  
In the event that the indemnifying party does not undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of a Third Party Claim in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 11.3, the indemnified party shall have the right to control the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its choosing; provided, however, that the indemnified party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent, unless (i) the terms of such settlement or compromise release the indemnified party or the indemnifying party from any and all liability with respect to the Third Party Claim, or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have acknowledged its obligations to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article XI and established security in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to secure the indemnifying party's obligations under this Article XI with respect to such Third Party Claim. The indemnifying party shall be entitled (at the indemnifying party's expense) to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with its own counsel.
 
(d)
  
Any indemnifiable Claim hereunder that is not a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by the indemnified party by promptly delivering notice thereof to the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party does not respond to such notice within 60 days after its receipt, it shall have no further right to contest the validity of such Claim.

In its defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall timely provide the indemnified party with such information with respect to such defense, compromise or settlement as the indemnified party shall request, and shall not assume any position or take any action that would impose an obligation of any kind on, or restrict the actions of, the indemnified party. The indemnified party shall be entitled (at the indemnified party's expense) to participate in the defense by the indemnifying party of any Third Party Claim with its own counsel.
 
(c)
  
In the event that the indemnifying party does not undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of a Third Party Claim in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 11.3, the indemnified party shall have the right to control the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its choosing; provided, however, that the indemnified party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent, unless (i) the terms of such settlement or compromise release the indemnified party or the indemnifying party from any and all liability with respect to the Third Party Claim, or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have acknowledged its obligations to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article XI and established security in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to secure the indemnifying party's obligations under this Article XI with respect to such Third Party Claim. The indemnifying party shall be entitled (at the indemnifying party's expense) to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with its own counsel.
 
(d)
  
Any indemnifiable Claim hereunder that is not a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by the indemnified party by promptly delivering notice thereof to the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party does not respond to such notice within 60 days after its receipt, it shall have no further right to contest the validity of such Claim.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
St. Louis, MO,. May 2, 2005Ameren Corporation (NYSE:AEE) today announced that its subsidiaryAmerenUE--has transferred certain of its Illinois electric distribution and transmission assets and natural gas distribution assets, along with related personnel to another subsidiary--- Springfield, Ill.-based AmerenCIPS. The utility asset transfer at net book value of
 
approximately
$138 million takes effect today.
 
In addition, to meet current generation capacity needs, Ameren also announced the transfer of approximately 550 megawatts of combustion turbines at Pinckneyville and Kinmundy, Ill., from Amerens non rate-regulated generating subsidiary, AmerenEnergy Generating Company, to AmerenUE. Priced at net book value of approximately $240 million, the transfer of these peak generating assets, which also takes effect today, will complete AmerenUEs 2002 Missouri electric rate case settlement commitment to make certain generating capacity investments prior to June 30, 2006.
 
This initiative will allow us to more effectively allocate our energy resources, and it will help us reduce future administrative costs, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer of St. Louis-based Ameren. Consolidating the two Illinois territories establishes a clean division between Illinois and Missouri for AmerenUE and AmerenCIPS. This action reflects our commitment to reducing costs, increasing efficiency and ensuring reliable energy supply.
 
The transfer of AmerenUE-Illinois utility properties has been approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The transfer of the generating assets received approval from the FERC and the SEC.
 
                                                                         - -- more --

The move of AmerenUE-Illinois customers and properties to AmerenCIPS will have no impact on the reliability of energy delivery or on energy rates/prices for any customer class. Also, consolidating Illinois electric and natural gas transmission and distribution assets will not have an impact on the existing customers of AmerenCIPS. AmerenUEs Illinois operations provide natural gas to approximately 18,000 customers and electricity to approximately 62,000 customers. AmerenUE-Illinois operated in the four southwestern Illinois counties of Jersey, Macoupin, Madison and St. Clair.
 
AmerenUEs electric generating facilities and certain of its electric transmission and communications facilities in Illinois were not part of the transfer. These Illinois facilities continue to be owned by Missouri-based rate-regulated AmerenUE.
 
Based in St. Louis, Ameren Corporation companies provide energy services to 3.2 million customers in a 64,000-square-mile area of Missouri and Illinois. Ameren is the parent of the utility operating subsidiaries
,
AmerenCIPS, AmerenCILCO, based in Peoria, Ill., AmerenIP based in Decatur, Ill., and of AmerenUE based in St. Louis, MO.
