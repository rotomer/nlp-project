SECTION 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ITEM 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The Ameren Companies July 2005 Revolving Credit Agreement (Exhibit 10.1 hereto) is a five-year revolving credit facility which provides for loans to and letters of credit issued for the accounts of the Ameren Companies in an amount up to $1.150 billion. The entire amount of the facility is available to Ameren. The sum of the outstanding loans made to and letters of credit issued for the account of any of the other Ameren Companies (other than UE) under the facility may not at any time exceed $150 million. The sum of the outstanding loans made to and letters of credit issued for the account of UE under the facility may not at any time exceed $500 million. Three forms of loans are available under the Ameren Companies July 2005 Revolving Credit Agreement: revolving loans provided by the lenders on a committed basis, competitive loans provided on an uncommitted basis through an auction mechanism and swingline loans provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on behalf of all lenders in an amount outstanding at any time not in excess of $100 million. At the option of each of the Ameren Companies, the interest rates applicable under the facility are ABR plus the margin applicable to the particular borrowing Ameren Company and Eurodollar rate plus the margin applicable to the particular borrowing Ameren Company. ABR is a fluctuating interest rate equal to the higher of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.s prime rate and the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 percent per annum. The Eurodollar interest rate is the applicable British Bankers Association London interbank offered rate for deposits in U. S. dollars.
The lenders commitments under the Ameren Companies July 2005 Revolving Credit Agreement will expire as to Ameren and borrowings by Ameren will mature on July 14, 2010. UE, CIPS, CILCO, Genco and IP are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the facility during the period of 364 days commencing on
July 14, 2005 and borrowings by these Ameren Companies will mature at the end of the 364 days. At the request of Ameren, the final maturity of the facility may be extended as to each consenting lender on any of the first four anniversaries of the July 14, 2005 closing date. Any of the other Ameren Companies may request 364 day extensions of the maturity of the facility as it applies to that company. The principal amount of each revolving loan will be due and payable no later than the final maturity of the facility in the case of Ameren and the last day of the 364 day period in the case of UE, CIPS, CILCO, Genco and IP. The principal amount of each competitive loan will be due and payable at the end of the interest period applicable to it, which shall not be later then the final maturity date of the facility. Swingline loans will mature five business days after they are made and will be made on same-day notice.
The Ameren Companies July 2005 Revolving Credit Agreement contains conditions to borrowings and issuance of letters of credit similar to those in Amerens terminated 2004 credit agreements discussed under Item 1.02 above, including absence of default or unmatured default, accuracy of representations (other than representations as to absence of material adverse change and material litigation) and warranties and required regulatory authorizations. The facility also contains non-financial covenants similar to those in Amerens terminated 2004 credit agreements including restrictions on the ability to incur liens, dispose of assets and merge with other entities. It contains a financial covenant that limits each of the Ameren Companies (except CILCOs) total indebtedness to 65 percent of total capitalization pursuant to a defined calculation. CILCOs total indebtedness is limited to 60 percent of total capitalization. In addition, the Ameren Companies July 2005 Revolving Credit Agreement contains default provisions similar to those in Amerens terminated 2004 credit agreements, including a cross default to the
 
 
- 3 -
 
occurrence of an event of default under any other agreement covering indebtedness of Ameren and its subsidiaries (other than project finance subsidiaries) and each of the other Ameren Companies in excess of $50 million in the aggregate. The obligation of the Ameren Companies under this facility are several and not joint, and except under limited circumstances, the obligations of UE, CIPS, CILCO, Genco and IP are not guaranteed by Ameren or any other subsidiary.
In addition to Amerens 2004 credit agreements discussed under Item 1.02 above, the Ameren Companies July 2005 Revolving Credit Agreement will replace UEs bilateral credit agreements in an aggregate amount of $153.5 million, CIPS bilateral credit agreements in an aggregate amount of $15 million, CILCOs bilateral credit agreements in an aggregate amount of $60 million and a bilateral credit agreement of Electric Energy, Inc. (an 80 percent-owned subsidiary of Ameren) in the amount of $25 million. The Ameren Companies will use the proceeds of any borrowings under this facility to repay any amounts outstanding under these terminated or replaced credit agreements and for general corporate purposes, including for working capital, commercial paper liquidity support and to fund loans under the Ameren Companies money pool arrangements.
The Ameren July 2005 Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (Exhibit 10.2 hereto) revises the July 2004 $350 million five-year credit facility by extending the maturity to July 14, 2010, making the entire amount of commitments available in the form of letters of credit as well as loans, and to conform, as applicable, the affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and representations and warranties to the Ameren Companies July 2005 Revolving Credit Agreement.

Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (iii) the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by a Borrower shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the requested Advance specified in the related Competitive Bid Request, (iv) to the extent necessary to comply with clause (iii) above, a Borrower may accept Competitive Bids at the same Competitive Bid Rate in part, which acceptance, in the case of multiple Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such Competitive Bid, and (v) except pursuant to clause (iv) above, no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $1,000,000;
provided further
that if a Competitive Loan must be in an amount less than $5,000,000 because of the provisions of clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner determined by the applicable Borrower.

Swingline Loans
.
(a)
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to each Borrower from time to time from and including the Closing Date and prior to the Availability Termination Date for such Borrower, in an amount that will not result in the Swingline Exposure exceeding $100,000,000;
provided
that (i) at no time shall the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure exceed the Aggregate Commitment, (ii) at no time shall the Committed Credit Exposure of any Lender exceed its Commitment and (iii) at no time shall the Subsidiary Credit Exposure of any Borrowing Subsidiary exceed the Subsidiary Sublimit of such Borrowing Subsidiary; and
provided
 
further
that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Borrower may, severally and not jointly with the other Borrowers, borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.
 
(b)
  
Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at (i) the rate per annum applicable to Floating Rate Advances or (ii) any other rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) which shall be quoted by the Swingline Lender on the date such Loan is made and accepted by the applicable Borrower as provided in this Section 2.5;
provided
, that commencing on any date on which the Swingline Lender requires the Lenders to acquire participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to Section 2.5(d), such Loan shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to Floating Rate Advances.
 
21
(c)
  
To request a Swingline Loan, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Swingline Lender of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, New York time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. If so requested by the applicable Borrower, the Swingline Lender will quote an interest rate that, if accepted by such Borrower, will be applicable to the requested Swingline Loan, and such Borrower will promptly notify the Swingline Lender in the event it accepts such rate. The Swingline Lender will promptly advise the Agent of any such notice received from such Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to such Borrower by means of a credit to an account with the Swingline Lender specified by such Borrower by 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
 
(d)
  
The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.11 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.11 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Agent shall notify the Company and the applicable Borrower of any participation in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from such Borrower (or other party on behalf of such Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participation therein shall be promptly remitted to the Agent; any such amounts received by the Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve such Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.
 
2.6.
  
Letters of Credit
.
 
(a)
  
General
. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) each Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account and (ii) the Company may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account and, jointly, for the account of any of its Subsidiaries (and in each case under this clause (ii), the Company shall be considered the
 
22
 
sole Borrower under such Letter of Credit for purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any listing of any Subsidiary as an account party or applicant with respect to such Letter of Credit), in each case in a form reasonably acceptable to the Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time prior to the Availability Termination Date for such Borrower (with respect to any Letter of Credit referred to in clause (i) of this sentence) or the Company (with respect to any Letter of Credit referred to in clause (ii) of this sentence), as the case may be. In the event any Letter of Credit is issued for the account of a Borrowing Subsidiary under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence and the Company is solely liable under such Letter of Credit as provided in the preceding sentence, the LC Exposure related to such Letter of Credit shall not be included in the Subsidiary Credit Exposure for such Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise applied or measured against the Subsidiary Sublimit for such Borrowing Subsidiary. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by a Borrower to, or entered into by a Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. The Company unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that, in connection with any Letter of Credit referred to in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph, it will be fully responsible for the reimbursement of LC Disbursements, the payment of interest thereon and the payment of LC Participation Fees and other fees due under Section 2.8.2 to the same extent as if it were the sole account party in respect of such Letter of Credit (the Company hereby irrevocably waiving any defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor of the obligations of any Subsidiary that shall be a joint account party in respect of any such Letter of Credit).
 
(b)
  
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions
. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the applicable Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the account party or account parties with respect to such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, such Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Banks standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, such Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure will not exceed the Aggregate Commitment, (ii) the Committed Credit Exposure of any Lender will not exceed its Commitment, (iii) the Subsidiary Credit Exposure of any Borrowing Subsidiary will not exceed the Subsidiary Sublimit of such Borrowing Subsidiary, (iv) the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by the applicable Issuing Bank will not exceed the LC Commitment of such Issuing Bank and (v) if the Commitment Termination Date shall have been extended pursuant to Section 2.23(a) with respect to some of but not all the Lenders, the
 
23
 
portion of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit with expiry dates after the Existing Commitment Termination Date (as defined in Section 2.23(a)) will not exceed the portion of the Aggregate Commitment attributable to the Commitments of the Consenting Lenders (as defined in Section 2.23(a)). If the Required Lenders notify the Issuing Banks that a Default exists and instruct the Issuing Banks to suspend the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of Letters of Credit, no Issuing Bank shall issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit without the consent of the Required Lenders until such notice is withdrawn by the Required Lenders (and each Lender that shall have delivered such notice agrees promptly to withdraw it at such time as no Default exists).
 
(c)
  
Expiration Date
. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Availability Termination Date for the applicable Borrower.
 
(d)
  
Participations
. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
 
(e)
  
Reimbursement
. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by such Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
provided
that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, such Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.1 or 2.5 that such payment be financed with a Floating Rate Advance or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Borrowers obligation to make such
 
24
 
payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Floating Rate Advance or Swingline Loan. If such Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Agent its Pro Rata Share of the payment then due from such Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.11 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.11 shall apply,
mutatis
 
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Agent of any payment from such Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of a Floating Rate Advance or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
 
(f)
  
Obligations Absolute
. Each Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be several, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrowers obligations hereunder. None of the Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers or employees, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to a Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), an Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof and subject to any non-waivable provisions of the laws and/or other rules to which a Letter of Credit
 
25
 
is subject, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(g)
  
Disbursement Procedures
. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
 
(h)
  
Interim Interest
. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Floating Rate Advances;
provided
that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.14 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
 
(i)
  
Cash Collateralization
. If any Default with respect to a Borrower shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that such Borrower receives notice from the Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, such Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Agent, in the name of the Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the portion of the LC Exposure as of such date attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Default with respect to such Borrower described in Sections 7.6 or 7.7. Such deposit shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of such Borrower under this Agreement. The Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Agent and at such Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements under Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
 
26
 
satisfaction of future reimbursement obligations under Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of such Borrower under this Agreement. If any Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of a Default with respect to such Borrower, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days after all Defaults with respect to such Borrower have been cured or waived.
 
(j)
  
Designation of Additional Issuing Banks
. From time to time, the Borrowers may by notice to the Agent and the Lenders designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement (an 
Issuing Bank Agreement
), which shall be in a form satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Agent, shall set forth the LC Commitment of such Lender and shall be executed by such Lender, the Borrowers and the Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an Issuing Bank.

Each Revolving Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Revolving Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically
 
29
converted into a Revolving Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such Revolving Eurodollar Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.10 or (y) the applicable Borrower shall have given the Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Revolving Eurodollar Advance continue as a Revolving Eurodollar Advance for the same or another Interest Period. Subject to the terms of Section 2.9, a Borrower may elect from time to time to convert all or any part of a Revolving Advance of any Type into any other Type or Types of Advances;
provided
that any conversion of any Revolving Eurodollar Advance shall be made on, and only on, the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.12, during the continuance of a Default or an Unmatured Default with respect to a Borrower, the Agent may (or shall at the direction of the Required Lenders), by notice to such Borrower, declare that no Revolving Advance of such Borrower may be made, converted or continued as a Eurodollar Advance. The applicable Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a Conversion/Continuation Notice) of each conversion of a Revolving Advance or continuation of a Revolving Eurodollar Advance not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) at least one (1) Business Day, in the case of a conversion into a Revolving Floating Rate Advance, or three (3) Business Days, in the case of a conversion into or continuation of a Revolving Eurodollar Advance, prior to the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:

Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate determined by the Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance based upon the applicable Borrowers selections under Sections 2.10 and 2.11 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Fixed Rate Advance shall bear interest at the Fixed Rate applicable thereto.
 
2.14.
  
Rates Applicable After Default

Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable during such Interest Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum,
provided
that, during the continuance of a Default with respect to any Borrower under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to all Advances, fees and other Obligations of such Borrower hereunder without any election or action on the part of the Agent or any Lender.

Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender. The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of any Borrower maintained with JPMCB for each payment of principal, interest and fees owed by such Borrower as it becomes due hereunder.

31
 
Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and
interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named

Telephonic Notices
. Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of such Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically. Each Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, signed by an Authorized Officer, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice.

2.18.
  
Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis
. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, on any date on which such Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of each applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the Advance of which such Loan is a part and, in the case of a Fixed Rate Advance with an Interest Period of more than 90 days duration (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Competitive Bid Request), each day prior to the last day of such Interest Period that occurs at intervals of 90 days duration after the first day of such Interest Period, and any other dates that are specified in the applicable Competitive Bid Request as dates for payment of interest with respect to such Advance. Interest accrued on each Swingline Loan shall be payable on the day that such Loan is required to be repaid. Interest accrued on any Advance that is not paid when due shall be payable on demand and on the date of payment in full.

Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance, any fees or any other amounts payable to the Agent or any Lender hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in

. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender in writing of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Agent will notify the applicable Borrower and each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Revolving Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Borrower and each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
 
2.20.
  
Lending Installations
. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.

2.21.
  
Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent
. Unless the applicable Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date (or, in the case of a Lender with respect to a Revolving Floating Rate Advance under Section 2.11, prior to the time) on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.
 
2.22.
  
Replacement of Lender
. If any Borrower is required pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lenders obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender so affected an Affected Lender), the Borrowers may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to terminate or replace the Commitment of such Affected Lender,
provided
that no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such termination or replacement, and
provided
 
further
that, concurrently with such termination or replacement, (i) if the Affected Lender is being replaced, another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash at face amount the Outstanding Credit Exposure of the Affected Lender pursuant to an Assignment Agreement
 
33
 
substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) each Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in immediately available funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by such Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender, in each case to the extent not paid by the purchasing lender and (iii) if the Affected Lender is being terminated, each Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender all Obligations due from such Borrower to such Affected Lender (including the amounts described in the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii) plus the outstanding principal balance of such Affected Lenders Advances and the amount of such Lenders funded participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers may not terminate the Commitment of an Affected Lender if, after giving effect to such termination, (x) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitment, or (y) the Subsidiary Credit Exposure of any Borrowing Subsidiary would exceed the Subsidiary Sublimit of such Borrowing Subsidiary.
 
2.23.
  
Extension of Commitment Termination Date and Borrowing Subsidiary Maturity Dates
.
(a)
 
Extension of Commitment Termination Date
. The Company may, by notice to the Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) given not less than 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to any of the first four anniversaries of the Closing Date (a Commitment Extension Request), request that the Lenders extend the Commitment Termination Date for an additional period of one year. Each Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Agents receipt of the Companys Commitment Extension Request, advise the Company whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called a Consenting Lender and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a Declining Lender). Any Lender that has not so advised the Company and the Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender. If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Commitment Extension Request, then the Commitment Termination Date shall, as to the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the first anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date theretofore in effect.  The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Commitment Extension Request shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender. The Commitment of any Declining Lender shall terminate on the Commitment Termination Date in effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (such Commitment Termination Date being called the Existing Commitment Termination Date). The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders (including any such Loans made to Borrowing Subsidiaries, whether or not the Maturity Dates applicable to such Borrowing Subsidiaries shall have been extended as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section), together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing Commitment Termination Date, and on the Existing Commitment Termination Date, the Borrowers shall also make such other prepayments of their respective Loans pursuant to Section 2.10 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments
 
34
 
 of, and all payments to, Declining Lenders pursuant to this sentence, (i) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure will not exceed the Aggregate Commitment and (ii) the Committed Credit Exposure of each Lender will not exceed its Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Company shall have the right, pursuant to Section 12.3, at any time prior to the Existing Commitment Termination Date, to replace a Declining Lender with a Lender or other financial institution that will agree to a Commitment Extension Request, and any such replacement Lender shall for all purposes constitute a Consenting Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Commitment Termination Date pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (i) the Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered with respect to the Company under Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.6, giving effect to such extension and (ii) on the anniversary of the Closing Date that immediately follows the date on which the Company delivers the applicable Commitment Extension Request, the conditions set forth in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 shall be satisfied (with all references in Sections 5.5 and 5.7 to the date of this Agreement being deemed to be references to the date of such anniversary of the Closing Date), and the Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by the chief financial officer, the controller or the treasurer of the Company.
 
 
(b)
  
Extension of Borrowing Subsidiary Maturity Dates
. Any Borrowing Subsidiary may, by notice (a Subsidiary Maturity Date Extension Request) to the Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) given not less than 45 days and not more than 60 days prior to the then-current Maturity Date with respect to such Borrowing Subsidiary, request an extension of such Maturity Date with respect to such Borrowing Subsidiary to a date 364 days after such Maturity Date (the Maturity Date in effect prior to any such extension being called the Existing Maturity Date with respect to such Borrowing Subsidiary) and on or prior to (but in no event after) the Commitment Termination Date (including any date to which the Commitment Termination Date has been extended or is simultaneously being extended pursuant to paragraph (a) above) or, if the Commitment Termination Date shall have been or is simultaneously being extended as to some but not all of the Lenders, the latest date to which the Commitment Termination Date applicable to any Lenders shall have been or is being so extended. Each Lender shall, by notice to such applicable Borrowing Subsidiary, the Company and the Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Agents receipt of such Borrowing Subsidiarys Subsidiary Maturity Date Extension Request, advise such applicable Borrowing Subsidiary and the Company whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called a Consenting Lender and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a Declining Lender). Any Lender that has not so advised such applicable Borrowing Subsidiary, the Company and the Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender. If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Subsidiary Maturity Date Extension Request, then the Maturity Date with respect to the applicable Borrowing Subsidiary shall, as to both the Consenting Lenders and the Declining Lenders, be extended to the date 364 days after the Existing Maturity Date with respect to such Borrowing Subsidiary;
provided
, that the Maturity Date with respect to a Borrowing Subsidiary shall in no event be extended beyond the latest date to which the Commitment Termination Date applicable to any Lenders shall have been extended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Maturity Date with respect to any Borrowing Subsidiary pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (i) the Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered with respect to such Borrowing Subsidiary under Sections 4.1.1 through
 
35
 
4.1.6, giving effect to such extension and (ii) on the Existing Maturity Date applicable to such Borrowing Subsidiary, the conditions set forth in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 shall be satisfied with respect to such Borrowing Subsidiary (with all references in Sections 5.5 and 5.7 to the date of this Agreement being deemed to be references to such Existing Maturity Date), and the Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by the chief financial officer, the controller or the treasurer of such Borrowing Subsidiary.
 
 
 
 
3.1.
  
Yield Protection

If, on or after the Closing Date, the adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change in any such law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:
 
3.1.1
  
subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation of payments (other than with respect to
                                        Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of its Eurodollar Loans, or
 
3.1.2
  
imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve, assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,     
       deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other than reserves and assessments taken into
   
   
   
account in determining the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or
 
3.1.3
  
imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation of making, funding or
                                        maintaining its Commitment, Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans or reduces any amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation in
connection with its Commitment, Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans, or requires any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation to make any payment
calculated by reference to the amount of Commitment, Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans held or interest received by it, by an amount deemed material by
such Lender,
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Commitment, Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such Commitment, Eurodollar Loans or Fixed Rate Loans, then, within 15 days of demand, accompanied by the written statement required by Section 3.6, by such Lender, the Borrowers
 
 
36
 
shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.
 
3.2.
  
Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations
. If a Lender determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand, accompanied by the written statement required by Section 3.6, by such Lender, the Borrowers shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Outstanding Credit Exposure or its Commitment hereunder (after taking into account such Lenders policies as to capital adequacy). Change means (i) any change after the Closing Date in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of, or change in, or change in the interpretation or administration of any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the Closing Date which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender. Risk-Based Capital Guidelines means (i) the risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the Closing Date, including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices Entitled International Convergence of Capital Measurements and Capital Standards, including transition rules, and any amendments to such regulations adopted prior to the Closing Date.
 
3.3.
  
Availability of Types of Advances
. If (x) any Lender determines that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or (y) the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, or (iii) no reasonable basis exists for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate, then the Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate Advances on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.
 
3.4.
  
Funding Indemnification
. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance or a Fixed Rate Loan occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not made or continued, a Fixed Rate Loan is not made or a Floating Rate Advance is not converted into a Eurodollar Advance, on the date specified by the applicable Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, or a Eurodollar Advance or Fixed Rate Loan is not prepaid on the date specified by such Borrower for any reason, such Borrower will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Advance or Fixed Rate Loan.
 
37
3.5.
  
Taxes
.
(i)
All payments by any Borrower to or for the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If a Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder by such Borrower to any Lender or the Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (b) such Borrower shall make such deductions, (c) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) such Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or, if a receipt cannot be obtained with reasonable efforts, such other evidence of payment as is reasonably acceptable to the Agent, in each case within 30 days after such payment is made.
 
 
 
 
38
 
taxes,
unless
an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on
which any  such delivery  would  otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and
delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrowers and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without
any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.
 
 
 
 
3.6.
  
Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity
. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Agent and the Company) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined
 
39
 
such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on such Borrower in the absence of manifest error, and upon reasonable request of such Borrower, such Lender shall promptly provide supporting documentation describing and/or evidence of the applicable event giving rise to such amount to the extent not inconsistent with such Lenders policies or applicable law. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type, currency and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the applicable Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of each Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
 
3.7.
  
Alternative Lending Installation
.
To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. A Lenders designation of an alternative Lending Installation shall not affect the Borrowers rights under Section 2.22 to replace a Lender.
 
3.8.
  
Allocation of Amounts Payable Among Borrowers
. Each amount payable by the Borrowers under this Article shall be an obligation of, and shall be discharged (a) to the extent arising out of acts, events and circumstances related to a particular Borrower, by such Borrower and (b) otherwise, by all the Borrowers, with each Borrower being severally liable for such Borrowers Contribution Percentage of such amount,
provided
that in consideration of the availability, on the terms set forth herein, of the entire amount of the Commitments in the form of borrowings by and Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Company, the Company agrees that, if one or more of the Borrowing Subsidiaries shall fail to pay any amount owed by it under clause (b) of this Section after a demand shall have been made by the Person to which such amount is owed, the Company shall promptly pay such amount (the Company hereby irrevocably waiving any defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor of the obligations of any Borrowing Subsidiary under this Section).

Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this sentence shall not apply to rights in respect of outstanding Competitive Loans.
 
12.3.2
  
Consents
. The consent of the Borrowers shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund,
provided
that the consent of the
 
73
 
Borrowers shall not be required if (i) a Default has occurred and is continuing or (ii) such assignment is in connection with the physical settlement of any Lenders obligations to direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements relating to the Loans;
provided
, that the assignment without the Borrowers consent pursuant to clause (ii) shall not increase the Borrowers liability under Section 3.5. The consent of the Agent and each Issuing Bank shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective. Any consent required under this Section 12.3.2 shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that any Issuing Bank may withhold such consent in its sole discretion).
 
12.3.3
  
Effect; Effective Date
. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of an Assignment Agreement, together with any consents required by Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The Assignment Agreement shall contain a representation and warranty by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the funds, money, assets or other consideration used to make the purchase and assumption of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable Assignment Agreement constitutes plan assets as defined under ERISA and that the rights, benefits and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be plan assets under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights, benefits and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure, if any, assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrowers, the Lenders or the Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lenders rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the Loan Documents. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.3, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrowers shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that, upon cancellation and surrender to the Borrowers of the Notes (if any) held by the transferor Lender, new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender, if applicable, and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their
 
 
74
 
respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments have been terminated, their respective Outstanding Credit Exposure), as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

provided
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.
 
12.5.
  
Tax Certifications
.

To the Lenders and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent
270 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10017
 
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Ameren Corporation, a Missouri corporation (the 
Company
), and its subsidiaries Union Electric Company, a Missouri corporation, Central Illinois Public Service Company, an Illinois corporation, Central Illinois Light Company, an Illinois corporation, Ameren Energy Generating Company, an Illinois corporation and Illinois Power Company, an Illinois corporation (the Company and such subsidiaries each a 
Borrower
 and collectively, the 
Borrowers
). I, or lawyers under my direction, have acted as counsel for the Borrowers in connection with the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of July 14, 2005 (the Credit Agreement), among the Borrowers, the lending institutions identified therein as Lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meanings.
 
In rendering the opinion expressed below, I, or lawyers under my direction, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In rendering the opinion expressed below with respect to matters of Illinois law as it applies to Central Illinois Public Service Company, Central Illinois Light Company, Ameren Energy Generating Company and Illinois Power Company, I, or lawyers under my direction, have relied on the opinion, of even date herewith and addressed to you, of Ronald S. Gieseke, Esq., Associate General Counsel of Ameren Services Company, an affiliate of the Borrowers.
 
In making the examinations described above, I have assumed without independent investigation the capacity of natural persons (other than the office held by each representative of the Borrowers) as reflected adjacent to such individuals signature on the Credit Agreement, the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of representatives of the Borrowers appearing on the Credit Agreement), the authenticity of all documents furnished to me as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents furnished to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. In addition, I have assumed without independent investigation that
 
 
 
(i) the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Lenders and the Agent, and constitutes their valid, lawful and binding obligation and agreement, and (ii) there is no separate agreement, undertaking, or course of dealing modifying, varying or waiving any of the terms of the Credit Agreement. As to matters of fact not independently established by me relevant to the opinions set forth herein, I have relied without independent investigation on the representations contained in the Credit Agreement and in certificates of public officials and responsible representatives of each Borrower furnished to me;
provided
,
however
, that I advise that in the course of my representation of the Borrowers, I obtained no information that leads me to believe that any such representation or certificate is untrue or misleading in any material respect.
 
Upon the basis of and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
Each of the Borrowers and each of their Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business as presently conducted in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
 
Each Borrower has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by each Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance by each Borrower of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
 
Neither the execution and delivery by each Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) such Borrowers or any Subsidiarys articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating agreement or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with, or constitute a default under, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of such Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of, any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by each
 
 
 
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings and issuances of Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the payment and performance by such Borrower of the Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.
 
Except for the Disclosed Matters, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry currently existing, or, to the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, pending or threatened against or affecting any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, which, if determined adversely to such Borrower or to its Subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Borrower or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Loans or would adversely effect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents or the ability of such Borrower to perform the transactions contemplated therein.
 
Neither any Borrower nor any Subsidiary of any Borrower is an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
The Company is a holding company, and each of Union Electric, CIPS, CILCO and IP is a public utility company, as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (together with all rules, regulations and orders promulgated or otherwise issued in connection therewith, the Holding Company Act). Pursuant to the Holding Company Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued its orders authorizing:
 
 
 
Genco is certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as an exempt wholesale generator under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Genco is not a public utility company under the Holding Company Act. The FERC, in accordance
 
 
with the Federal Power Act, has issued an order authorizing the incurrence by Genco of short-term indebtedness for borrowed money in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $300,000,000, subject to, among other things, the condition that all such indebtedness be issued on or before June 22, 2006 and, mature not later than 364 days thereafter, unless the Federal Power Act is repealed or revised.
 
Such orders of the SEC and the FERC are in full force and effect. Loans contemplated by the Credit Agreement are short-term indebtedness for borrowed money and, in the case of the Company only, also long-term indebtedness for borrowed money within the meaning of the aforesaid orders of the SEC and the FERC. Unless such authorization is no longer required by applicable laws and regulations, additional authorization from the SEC or the FERC (or any governmental agency that succeeds to the authority of the SEC or the FERC, as applicable) will be necessary in order for (i) the Company or IP, after June 30, 2007, (ii) Union Electric, CIPS or CILCO after March 31, 2006, and (iii) Genco, after June 22, 2006, to obtain any Advances under this Agreement or to incur or issue short-term indebtedness for borrowed money and, in the case of the Company, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money, including, without limitation, Loans extended under the Credit Agreement. No other federal governmental consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings are required in connection with the extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement or the performance by each Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Agreement.
 
In a properly presented case, a Missouri court or a federal court applying Missouri choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Credit Agreement and should hold that the Credit Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Missouri. In rendering the foregoing opinion, I note that by its terms the Credit Agreement expressly selects New York law as the law governing its interpretation and that the Credit Agreement was delivered to the Agent in New York. The choice of law provisions of the Credit Agreement are not voidable under the laws of the State of Missouri. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Missouri court or a federal court holds that the Credit Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, the Credit Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower thereto, enforceable under Missouri law (including usury provisions) against such Borrower in accordance with its terms.
 
I express no opinion as to the compliance or noncompliance, or the effect of the compliance or noncompliance, of any addressee with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to it by reason of its status as or affiliation with a federally insured depository institution.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Missouri and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Missouri and the Federal laws of the United States of America. I note that the Credit Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and, for purposes of the opinion expressed in opinion paragraph 2 above, I have assumed that the laws of the State of New York do not differ from the laws of the State of Missouri in any manner that would render such opinion incorrect. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be
 
 
relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person (other than your successors and assigns as Lenders and, as to certain matters involving the application of the laws of the State of Missouri or the Federal laws of the United States of America contained in his opinion addressed to you and dated the date hereof, Ronald S. Gieseke) without my prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything in this opinion letter to the contrary, you may disclose this opinion (i) to prospective successors and assigns of the addressees hereof, (ii) to regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over any of the addressees hereof or their successors and assigns, and (iii) pursuant to valid legal process, in each case without my prior consent. This opinion is delivered as of the date hereof and I undertake no, and disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in matters of law or fact set forth herein or upon which this opinion is based.
 
 
 
 
To the Lenders and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent
270 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10017
 
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am an Associate General Counsel of Ameren Services Company, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation and an affiliate of Central Illinois Public Service Company, an Illinois corporation, Central Illinois Light Company, an Illinois corporation, Ameren Energy Generating Company, an Illinois corporation and Illinois Power Company, an Illinois corporation (collectively, the 
Illinois Borrowers
). I, or lawyers under my direction, have acted as counsel for the Illinois Borrowers in connection with the Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of July 14, 2005 (the Credit Agreement), among Ameren Corporation, Union Electric Company, the Illinois Borrowers, the lending institutions identified therein as Lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meanings.
 
In rendering the opinion expressed below, I, or lawyers under my direction, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion. In rendering the opinion expressed below with respect to matters relating to the applications of the laws of the State of Missouri or the Federal laws of the United States of America, I have relied on the opinion, of even date herewith and addressed to you, of Steven R. Sullivan, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Ameren Corporation and its subsidiaries Union Electric Company, Central Illinois Public Service Company, Central Illinois Light Company, Ameren Energy Generating Company and Illinois Power Company.
 
In making the examinations described above, I have assumed without independent investigation the capacity of natural persons (other than the office held by each representative of the Illinois Borrowers) as reflected adjacent to such individuals signature on the Credit Agreement, the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of representatives of the Illinois Borrowers appearing on the Credit Agreement), the authenticity of all documents furnished to me as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents furnished to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the
 
 
 
originals of such documents. In addition, I have assumed without independent investigation that (i) the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Lenders and the Agent, and constitutes their valid, lawful and binding obligation and agreement, and (ii) there is no separate agreement, undertaking, or course of dealing modifying, varying or waiving any of the terms of the Credit Agreement. As to matters of fact not independently established by me relevant to the opinions set forth herein, I have relied without independent investigation on the representations contained in the Credit Agreement and in certificates of public officials and responsible representatives of each Illinois Borrower furnished to me;
provided
,
however
, that I advise that in the course of my representation of the Illinois Borrowers, I obtained no information that leads me to believe that any such representation or certificate is untrue or misleading in any material respect.
 
Upon the basis of and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
Each of the Illinois Borrowers and each of their Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business as presently conducted in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
 
Each Illinois Borrower has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by each Illinois Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance by each Illinois Borrower of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which such Illinois Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of such Illinois Borrower enforceable against such Illinois Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
 
Neither the execution and delivery by each Illinois Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on such Illinois Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) such Illinois Borrowers or any Subsidiarys articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating agreement or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which such Illinois Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with, or constitute a default under, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of such Illinois Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of, any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or
 
 
 
validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by each Illinois Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by such Illinois Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings and issuances of Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the payment and performance by such Illinois Borrower of the Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.
 
In a properly presented case, an Illinois court or a federal court applying Illinois choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Credit Agreement and should hold that the Credit Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Illinois. In rendering the foregoing opinion, I note that by its terms the Credit Agreement expressly selects New York law as the law governing its interpretation and that the Credit Agreement was delivered to the Agent in New York. The choice of law provisions of the Credit Agreement are not voidable under the laws of the State of Illinois. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if an Illinois court or a federal court holds that the Credit Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, the Credit Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower thereto, enforceable under Illinois law (including usury provisions) against such Borrower in accordance with its terms.
 
I express no opinion as to the compliance or noncompliance, or the effect of the compliance or noncompliance, of any addressee with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to it by reason of its status as or affiliation with a federally insured depository institution.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Illinois and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Illinois and the Federal laws of the United States of America. I note that the Credit Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and, for purposes of the opinion expressed in opinion paragraph 2 above, I have assumed that the laws of the State of New York do not differ from the laws of the State of Illinois in any manner that would render such opinion incorrect. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person (other than your successors and assigns as Lenders and, as to certain matters involving the application of the laws of the State of Illinois in his opinion addressed to you and dated the date hereof, Steven R. Sullivan) without my prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything in this opinion letter to the contrary, you may disclose this opinion (i) to prospective successors and assigns of the addressees hereof, (ii) to regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over any of the addressees hereof or their successors and assigns, and (iii) pursuant to valid legal process, in each case without my prior consent. This opinion is delivered as of the date hereof and I undertake no, and disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in matters of law or fact set forth herein or upon which this opinion is based.

To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by
 
 
21
 
 
electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the account party or account parties with respect to such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Banks standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure will not exceed the Aggregate Commitment, (ii) the Committed Credit Exposure of any Lender will not exceed its Commitment and (iii) the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by the applicable Issuing Bank will not exceed the LC Commitment of such Issuing Bank. If the Required Lenders notify the Issuing Banks that a Default exists and instruct the Issuing Banks to suspend the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of Letters of Credit, no Issuing Bank shall issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit without the consent of the Required Lenders until such notice is withdrawn by the Required Lenders (and each Lender that shall have delivered such notice agrees promptly to withdraw it at such time as no Default exists).
 
(c)
  
Expiration Date.
Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Facility Termination Date.
 
(d)
  
Participations.
By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
 
 
22
 
(e)
  
Reimbursement.
If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
provided
that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.1 or 2.5 that such payment be financed with a Floating Rate Advance or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Floating Rate Advance or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Agent its Pro Rata Share of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.11 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.11 shall apply,
mutatis
 
mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of a Floating Rate Advance or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
 
(f)
  
Obligations Absolute.
The Borrowers obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers obligations hereunder. None of the Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers or employees, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to
 
 
23
 
 
any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Banks failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), an Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof and subject to any non-waivable provisions of the laws and/or other rules to which a Letter of Credit is subject, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
 
(g)
  
Disbursement Procedures.
The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
 
(h)
  
Interim Interest.
If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Floating Rate Advances;
provided
that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.14 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
 
(i)
  
Cash Collateralization.
If any Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Agent, in the name of the Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due
 
 
24
 
 
and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Default with respect to the Borrower described in Sections 7.6 or 7.7. Such deposit shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Agent and at the Borrowers risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of future reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of a Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Defaults have been cured or waived.
 
(j)
  
Designation of Additional Issuing Banks
. From time to time, the Borrower may by notice to the Agent and the Lenders designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement (an 
Issuing Bank Agreement
), which shall be in a form satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent, shall set forth the LC Commitment of such Lender and shall be executed by such Lender, the Borrower and the Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term Issuing Bank shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an Issuing Bank.

provided
that, if any Lender continues to have Revolving Credit Exposure outstanding hereunder after the termination of its Commitment (including, without limitation, during any period when Loans or Letters of Credit may be outstanding but new Loans or Letters of Credit may not be borrowed or issued hereunder), then the Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Lender until

Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Revolving Advances; No Conversion or Continuation of Revolving Eurodollar Advances After Default
. Revolving Floating Rate Advances shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless and until such Revolving Floating Rate Advances are converted into Revolving Eurodollar Advances pursuant to this Section 2.12 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.10. Each Revolving Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Revolving Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically converted into a Revolving Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such Revolving Eurodollar Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.10 or (y) the Borrower shall have given the Agent a Conversion/Continuation Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period, such Revolving Eurodollar Advance continue as a Revolving Eurodollar Advance for the same or another Interest Period.

Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the Eurodollar Rate determined by the Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrowers selections under Sections 2.10 and 2.11 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof.

28
 
 
Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum,

Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such Lender. The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower maintained with JPMCB for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder.

The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Agent a written confirmation, signed by an Authorized Officer, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.
 
2.18.
  
Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis
. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Original Effective Date, on any date on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the last day of each applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest accrued on each Fixed Rate Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the Advance of which such Loan is a part and, in the case of a Fixed Rate Advance with an Interest Period of more than 90 days duration (unless otherwise specified in the applicable Competitive Bid Request), each day prior to the last day of such Interest Period that occurs at intervals of 90 days duration after the first day of such Interest Period, and any other dates that are specified in the applicable Competitive Bid Request as dates for payment of interest with respect to such Advance. Interest accrued on each Swingline Loan shall be payable on the day that such Loan is required to be repaid. Interest accrued on any Advance that is not paid when due shall be payable on demand and on the date of payment in full. Interest on Eurodollar Advances, Fixed Rate Loans and fees hereunder shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest on Floating Rate Advances shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance, any fees or any other amounts payable to the Agent or any Lender hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest, fees and commissions in connection with such payment.

Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent will notify each Lender in writing of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Agent will notify the Borrower and each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Revolving Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate.
 
2.20.
  
Lending Installations
. Each Lender may book its Loans at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
 
2.21.
  
Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent
. Unless the Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date (or, in the case of a Lender with respect to a Revolving Floating Rate Advance under Section 2.11, prior to the time) on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.
 
2.22.
  
Replacement of Lender
. If the Borrower is required pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lenders obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender so affected an Affected Lender), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to terminate or replace the Commitment of such Affected Lender,
provided
that no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such termination or replacement, and
provided
 
further
that, concurrently with such termination or replacement, (i) if the Affected Lender is being replaced, another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash at face amount the Outstanding Credit Exposure of the Affected Lender pursuant to an Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the
 
 
31

. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other entities (Purchasers) all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be evidenced by an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto (each such agreement, an Assignment Agreement). Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount equal to the entire applicable Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure of the assigning Lender or (unless each of the Borrower and the Agent otherwise consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000. The amount of the assignment shall be based on the Commitment or, if the Commitments have been terminated, the Outstanding Credit Exposure subject to the assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the Trade Date, if the Trade Date is specified in the Assignment Agreement. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this sentence shall not apply to rights in respect of outstanding Competitive Loans.
 
12.3.2
  
Consents
. The consent of the Borrower shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund,
provided
that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required if (i) a Default has occurred and is continuing or (ii) such assignment is in connection with the physical settlement of any Lenders obligations to direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements relating to the Loans;
provided
, that the assignment without the Borrowers consent pursuant to clause (ii) shall not increase the Borrowers liability under Section 3.5. The consent of the Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective. Any consent required under this Section 12.3.2 shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (except that any Issuing Bank may withhold such consent in its sole discretion).
 
12.3.3
  
Effect; Effective Date
. Upon (i) delivery to the Agent of an Assignment Agreement, together with any consents required by Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The Assignment Agreement shall contain a representation and warranty by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the funds, money, assets or other consideration used to make the purchase and assumption of the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure under the applicable Assignment Agreement constitutes plan assets as defined under ERISA and that the rights, benefits and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be plan assets under ERISA. On
 
 
65
 
 
and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights, benefits and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released with respect to the Commitment and Outstanding Credit Exposure, if any, assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent. In the case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lenders rights, benefits and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of, and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of the Loan Documents. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 12.2. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.3, the transferor Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that, upon cancellation and surrender to the Borrower of the Notes (if any) held by the transferor Lender, new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender, if applicable, and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments have been terminated, their respective Outstanding Credit Exposure), as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.
 
12.3.4
  
Register
. The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower (and the Borrower hereby designates the Agent to act in such capacity), shall maintain at one of its offices in New York, New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register (the Register) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of and interest on the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time and whether such Lender is an original Lender or assignee of another Lender pursuant to an assignment under this Section 13.3. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
12.4.
  
Dissemination of Information
. The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a Transferee) and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lenders possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries;
provided
that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement.
 
12.5.
  
Tax Certifications
. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, the
 
 
66
 
 
transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

To the Lenders and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent
270 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10017
 
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Ameren Corporation, a Missouri corporation (the Borrower). I, or lawyers under my direction, have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the Amended and Restated Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of July 14, 2005 (the Credit Agreement), among the Borrower, the lending institutions identified therein as Lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein with the same meanings.
 
In rendering the opinion expressed below, I, or lawyers under my direction, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
 
In making the examinations described above, I have assumed without independent investigation the capacity of natural persons (other than the office held by each representative of the Borrower) as reflected adjacent to such individuals signature on the Credit Agreement, the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of representatives of the Borrower appearing on the Credit Agreement), the authenticity of all documents furnished to me as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents furnished to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. In addition, I have assumed without independent investigation that (i) the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Lenders and the Agent, and constitutes their valid, lawful and binding obligation and agreement, and (ii) there is no separate agreement, undertaking, or course of dealing modifying, varying or waiving any of the terms of the Credit Agreement. As to matters of fact not independently established by me relevant to the opinions set forth herein, I have relied without independent investigation on the representations contained in the Credit Agreement and in certificates of public officials and responsible representatives of the Borrower furnished to me;
provided
,
however
, that I advise that in the course of my
 
 
 
 
representation of the Borrower, I obtained no information that leads me to believe that any such representation or certificate is untrue or misleading in any material respect.
 
Upon the basis of and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
 
Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business as presently conducted in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
 
The Borrower has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
 
Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) the Borrowers or any Subsidiarys articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating agreement or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with, or constitute a default under, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of, any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings and issuances of Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the payment and performance by the Borrower of the Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.
 
Except for the Disclosed Matters, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry currently existing, or, to the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, pending or threatened against or affecting the Borrower of any of its
 
 
2
 
 
Subsidiaries, which, if determined adversely to the Borrower or to its Subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Loans or would adversely effect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents or the ability of the Borrower to perform the transactions contemplated therein.
 
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is an investment company or a company controlled by an investment company, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
The Borrower is a holding company, as such term is defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (together with all rules, regulations and orders promulgated or otherwise issued in connection therewith, the Holding Company Act). Pursuant to the Holding Company Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued its order authorizing (a) the incurrence by the Borrower of short-term indebtedness for borrowed money in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time $1,500,000,000 and (b) the issuance and sale by the Borrower of capital stock, preferred stock, certain other specified securities and long-term indebtedness for borrowed money in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed at any time $2,500,000,000, subject to, among other things, the condition that all such indebtedness be issued on or before June 30, 2007, and in the case of short-term indebtedness for borrowed money, mature not later than 364 days thereafter. Such order of the SEC is in full force and effect. Loans contemplated by the Credit Agreement are short-term indebtedness for borrowed money and long-term indebtedness for borrowed money within the meaning of the aforesaid order of the SEC. An additional authorization from the SEC will be necessary in order for the Borrower, after June 30, 2007, to obtain any Advances under the Credit Agreement (assuming the Facility Termination Date has not already occurred prior to such date) or to incur or issue short-term indebtedness for borrowed money and long-term indebtedness for borrowed money, in each case including, without limitation, Loans extended under the Credit Agreement. No other federal governmental consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations, declarations or filings are required in connection with the extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement or the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the Credit Agreement.
 
In a properly presented case, a Missouri court or a federal court applying Missouri choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Credit Agreement and should hold that the Credit Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Missouri. In rendering the foregoing opinion, I note that by its terms the Credit Agreement expressly selects New York law as the law governing its interpretation and that the Credit Agreement was delivered to the Agent in New York. The choice of law provisions of the Credit Agreement are not voidable under the laws of the State of Missouri. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Missouri court or a federal court holds that the Credit Agreement is to be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, the Credit Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower thereto, enforceable under Missouri law (including usury provisions) against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.

I express no opinion as to the compliance or noncompliance, or the effect of the compliance or noncompliance, of any addressee with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to it by reason of its status as or affiliation with a federally insured depository institution.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Missouri and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Missouri and the Federal laws of the United States of America. I note that the Credit Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and, for purposes of the opinion expressed in opinion paragraph 2 above, I have assumed that the laws of the State of New York do not differ from the laws of the State of Missouri in any manner that would render such opinion incorrect. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person (other than your successors and assigns as Lenders) without my prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything in this opinion letter to the contrary, you may disclose this opinion (i) to prospective successors and assigns of the addressees hereof, (ii) to regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over any of the addressees hereof or their successors and assigns, and (iii) pursuant to valid legal process, in each case without my prior consent. This opinion is delivered as of the date hereof and I undertake no, and disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in matters of law or fact set forth herein or upon which this opinion is based.
