FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
St. Louis, Mo., Jul. 28, 2005 --- Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second quarter 2005 net income of $185
milli
on, or 93 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2004 net income of $118 million, or 65 cents per share. Net income for the first six months of 2005 was $306 million, or $1.55 per share, compared to $215 million, or $1.20 per share, in the first half of 2004.
 
Ameren also announced today that it expects 2005 earnings to be between $3.00 and $3.20 per share, up from the previously expected range of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. Amerens guidance assumes normal weather for the rest of the year and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, completion of the scheduled Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage later this year as planned, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.
 
Amerens earnings per share in the second quarter of 2005 benefited from stronger interchange power sales margins, earnings from Illinois Power Company, hotter-than-normal weather and the lack of a refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant, which had reduced 2004 second quarter earnings, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Ameren Corporation. These increases were offset, in part, by higher labor, employee benefits and depreciation expenses in our pre-Illinois Power acquisition business. In addition, Ameren received an $18 million refund in the second quarter of 2004 from the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator for previously paid exit fees that did not recur in 2005.
 
We increased our 2005 earnings guidance today by 10 cents per share. This increase is being driven largely by an improved outlook for interchange sales margins in 2005 compared to

our original expectations, due primarily to higher power prices, added Rainwater.
 
Revenues in the second quarter of 2005 increased to $1.6 billion from $1.1 billion in 2004. Illinois Power Company, acquired in September 2004, added electric revenues of $268 million and gas revenues of $73 million in the second quarter of 2005. In addition, electric revenues increased approximately $13 million due to hotter-than-normal weather in the second quarter of 2005, as compared to the second quarter of 2004. According to the National Weather Service, cooling degree days in the companys service territory were 22 percent greater than normal in the second quarter of 2005 and 6 percent above 2004 levels.
 
Excluding the effect of the Illinois Power Company acquisition, weather-sensitive residential and commercial electric megawatthour sales increased 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively, in the second quarter of 2005 compared to 2004. Excluding the effect of the Illinois Power Company acquisition, industrial electric megawatthour sales decreased 5 percent in the second quarter of 2005, versus the year-ago period. The net decrease was principally due to the reduction of sales under low-margin power sales contracts, partially offset by the addition of Noranda Aluminum, Inc. as a customer on June 1, 2005.
 
Interchange revenues were up $66 million as sales increased by 39 percent in the second quarter of 2005 over the prior year period. In addition, power prices rose 27 percent, averaging $38 per megawatthour in the second quarter of 2005 versus approximately $30 per megawatthour in last years second quarter. Increased plant availability and the new Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator market also provided the opportunity for increased interchange sales versus the year-ago period.
 
Operating expenses rose $319 million in the second quarter of 2005, compared to the year-ago period, principally due to the acquisition of Illinois Power Company, which added $306 million in operating expenses, and higher fuel and purchased power costs resulting principally from increased sales. In the second quarter of 2004, Ameren incurred operating expenses of $63 million related to the 64-day refueling and maintenance outage at its Callaway nuclear plant. There was no refueling outage in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Illinois Power Company contributed net income of $15 million to Amerens earnings in the second quarter of 2005. Common shares issued in advance of the September 2004 completion of the Illinois Power acquisition diluted second quarter 2004 earnings by an estimated 8 cents per share.

Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Thursday, July 28, to discuss second quarter 2005 earnings and other matters related to the company.

A slide presentation is also available on Amerens Web site that reconciles earnings per share between the second quarter and first six months of 2005 and the same periods of 2004 and reconciles 2005 earnings guidance to 2004 actual earnings. This presentation will be posted in the Investors section of the site under Presentations. The analyst call will also be available for replay on the Internet for one year. Telephone playback of the conference call will also be available beginning at 12:00 p.m. (Central Time), from July 28 through August 5, by dialing, U.S. (888) 457-0820; international (719) 457-1112 and entering the number: 9441502.

Ameren owns a diverse mix of electric generating plants strategically located in its Midwest market with a generating capacity of more than 15,000 megawatts.
 
Regulation G
In addition to presenting electric revenues and statistics on a consolidated basis, Ameren has presented electric revenues and statistics for the first three and six months of 2005, excluding Illinois Power Company. Ameren believes this information is useful because it enables readers to compare results between periods without giving effect to the Illinois Power Company acquisition that was completed in September 2004.
