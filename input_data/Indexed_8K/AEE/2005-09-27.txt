SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS
 
ITEM 8.01 Other Events.
Reference is made to Outlook under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the combined Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2005, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries for a discussion of the estimated increase in average Illinois electric rates after the expiration of the legislative electric rate freeze on January 1, 2007, for Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS, Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP, (collectively, the Ameren Illinois Utilities) which was reported by Ameren during Illinois legislative hearings held in March 2005. Reference is also made to the combined Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 15, 2005, of Ameren and its registrant subsidiaries for a discussion of, among other things, a letter dated September 2, 2005, from Illinois Governor Blagojevich to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) expressing his opposition to the Ameren Illinois Utilities proposed reverse auction process for procuring electric generation to take effect after the current Illinois electric rate freeze expires and requesting dismissal of the Ameren Illinois Utilities pending proceeding for approval of such process (the Governors letter) (Exhibit 99.1 thereto) and for a discussion of the Ameren Illinois Utilities September 15, 2005, response to the Governors letter (Exhibit 99.2 thereto). As reported in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2005, Ameren indicated at the March legislative hearings that it expected the average electric rates for the Ameren Illinois Utilities, on a combined basis, to increase by 10% to 20% in 2007 over present bundled rate levels, with 50% to 70% of this increase resulting from higher power costs based on 2005 market prices for power at the time of the estimate.
Ameren reports that updates to the assumptions upon which the above-referenced estimate was based currently indicate that the average electric rates for the Ameren Illinois Utilities, on a combined basis, may increase by 20% to 35% in 2007 over present bundled rate levels. This new estimate (like the earlier estimate) is based on a number of assumptions about electricity consumption, market prices for power, the type of power supply product to be procured, future auction results, infrastructure investment levels, operating and financing costs, ratemaking outcomes and various other factors. For the purpose of this new estimate, August 2005 power prices in a range of around $55 per megawatt hour were assumed. Such power prices represent in a range of around 70% of the estimated 2007 average electric rate increase. Actual results could be significantly different from these assumptions.

The Ameren Illinois Utilities are unable to predict whether, and to what extent, they will be granted the estimated electric rate increases by the ICC. In their response to the Governors letter, the Ameren Illinois Utilities stated that they look forward to engaging in further dialogue with the Governor and other key stakeholders to find a constructive solution to this important matter. A constructive solution could include a rate increase phase-in plan.
This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Ameren Corporation, Union Electric Company, Central Illinois Public Service Company, Ameren Energy Generating Company, CILCORP Inc., Central Illinois Light Company and Illinois Power Company (each a registrant). Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf.
