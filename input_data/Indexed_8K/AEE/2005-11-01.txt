FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
St. Louis, Mo., Nov. 1, 2005 --- Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced third quarter 2005 net income of $280
milli
on, or $1.37 per share, compared to third quarter 2004 net income of $232 million, or $1.20 per share. Net income for the first nine months of 2005 was $586 million, or $2.94 per share, compared to $447 million, or $2.44 per share, in the first nine months of 2004.
 
Significantly warmer summer weather and earnings from Illinois Power, acquired on Sept. 30, 2004, drove an increase in year-over-year per share earnings in the third quarter of 2005, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Ameren Corporation. These increases were offset, in part, by higher fuel and purchased power costs and higher operating expenses at our Callaway nuclear plant due to the start of a 70 to 75-day scheduled outage on Sept. 17, 2005.
 
Revenues in the third quarter of 2005 increased to $1.9 billion from $1.3 billion in 2004. Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP, added electric revenues of $358 million and gas revenues of $61 million in the third quarter of 2005. In addition, electric revenues increased approximately $86 million due to warmer weather in the third quarter of 2005, as compared to the third quarter of 2004. According to the National Weather Service, cooling degree days in the companys service territory in the third quarter of 2005 were 53 percent above 2004 levels and 16 percent greater than normal.
 
Excluding the effect of the Illinois Power Company acquisition, weather-sensitive residential megawatthour sales increased 22 percent, and commercial electric megawatthour sales increased 8 percent, in the third quarter of 2005 compared to 2004. In addition, industrial electric megawatthour sales increased 2 percent in the third quarter of 2005 over the year-ago period. The increase in industrial sales was principally due to the addition of Noranda Aluminum, Inc, which became a customer on June 1, 2005.

Interchange sales decreased 42 percent in the third quarter of 2005 as compared to the third quarter of 2004. The decrease in interchange sales was largely due to a reduction in the amount of excess power available for sale principally as a result of the addition of Noranda Aluminum as a customer, increased residential and commercial native load demand due to warmer weather, coal conservation efforts and the planned refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant. Despite this significant decrease in interchange sales, interchange revenues in the third quarter of 2005 were only $4 million below the prior-year period due to a 65 percent jump in power prices. Interchange revenues averaged $46 per megawatthour in the third quarter of 2005 versus $28 per megawatthour in last years third quarter. Higher coal and natural gas prices, coupled with increased electricity demand, led to elevated power prices this quarter.
 
Operating expenses increased $464 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to the year-ago period, principally due to the acquisition of Illinois Power Company, which added $321 million in operating expenses in the third quarter of 2005. In addition, excluding the effect of the Illinois Power acquisition, fuel and purchased power costs rose $114 million principally due to higher native load sales, unscheduled plant outages and the incremental costs of operating in the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator Day Two Energy market. The higher fuel and purchased power costs were offset, in part, by gains from emission allowance transactions in the companys unregulated operations. In addition, the refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway nuclear plant increased operating costs in the third quarter of 2005 over third quarter 2004, when there was no refueling and maintenance outage.
 
Illinois Power Company contributed net income of $53 million to Amerens earnings in the third quarter of 2005. Common shares issued by Ameren in advance of the September 2004 completion of the Illinois Power acquisition diluted third quarter 2004 earnings by an estimated 14 cents per share.
 
Ameren also announced today that it is reaffirming its 2005 earnings guidance. The company continues to expect 2005 earnings to range between $3.00 and $3.20 per share. Amerens guidance assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, timely completion of the scheduled Callaway nuclear plant refueling and maintenance outage in November, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.

Regulation G
In addition to presenting electric revenues and statistics on a consolidated basis, Ameren has presented electric revenues and statistics for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2005, excluding Illinois Power Company. Ameren believes this information is useful because it enables readers to compare results between periods without giving effect to the Illinois Power Company acquisition that was completed in September 2004.
