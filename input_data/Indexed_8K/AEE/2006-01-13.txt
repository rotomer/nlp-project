ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Reference is made to Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 8 - Related Party Transactions to financial statements under Part I, Item 1, and Outlook under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2005, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE (UE), Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), and Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco) for a discussion of an amendment to the joint dispatch agreement among UE, CIPS and Genco which was required by the order issued by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) approving UEs transfer of its Illinois electric and natural gas service territory to CIPS. The joint dispatch agreement as amended effective May 1, 2000 (First Amended JDA) (filed as Exhibit 10.4 in File No. 333-56594), under which UE and Genco jointly dispatch electric generation, provides each affiliate the option to serve its load requirements from its own generation first and then to allow access to any available remaining generation to its affiliate at incremental cost. Any excess generation not used by UE or Genco to serve load requirements is sold to third parties on a short-term basis. Under the provisions of the First Amended JDA, the margins or profits from third party sales were required to be allocated between UE and Genco using the ratio of each companys load requirements to the companies combined load regardless of which company sourced the power. The order of the MoPSC referred to above required an amendment to the First Amended JDA to provide that margins on third party short-term power sales be allocated between UE and Genco based on generation output and not on load requirements.
In compliance with the MoPSC order, UE, CIPS and Genco on January 9, 2006 entered into an amendment to the First Amended JDA to effectuate the change required by the MoPSC. This amendment, referred to as the Second Amendment to the Joint Dispatch Agreement (Second Amended JDA), provided that it was effective January 10, 2006, subject to acceptance and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). A copy of the text of the Second Amended JDA is included as Exhibit 10.1. UE, CIPS and Genco filed their joint request for acceptance and approval of the amendment with the FERC on January 9, 2006. The registrants are unable to predict the action that the FERC will take in response to the Second Amended JDA.
 
The change reflected in the Second Amended JDA would affect the allocation between Genco and UE of margins on excess generation sold. Based on operating performance for 2005, such change would likely have resulted in a transfer of electric margins from Genco to UE of $35 to $45 million based on certain assumptions and historical results. The ultimate impact of the amendment will be determined by future native load demand, the availability of electric generation from UE and Genco and market prices, among other things, but such impact could be material. Amerens earnings could be affected if electric rates for UE are adjusted by the MoPSC to reflect the provisions of the MoPSC order discussed above, including the Second Amended JDA, and/or other changes to the joint dispatch agreement.

a)
 
Energy from the lowest Incremental Cost generation from each Generating Party's own Generating Resources shall first be assigned to its own Load Requirements.
b)
 
Energy available from Off-System Purchases made by one of the Generating Parties, including existing Off-System Purchases, shall be assigned to the Generating Party who contracted for the purchase, when it is economical. Any energy from Off-System Purchases made by one of the Generating Parties, which the After-the-Fact Resource Allocation does not assign economically to any Generating Party, shall be assigned to the Generating Party who contracted for the purchase. The cost of energy assigned shall be the actual cost of the energy component of the Off-System Purchase.
c)
 
Energy from Generating Resources which are not economical to be operated per System Dispatch but are utilized due to operating constraints shall be allocated to the Generating Party owning the generating unit(s), unless the other Generating Party's Load Requirements or operating conditions are clearly identified as the reason for the generation, in which case the energy is assigned to the other Generating Party as a System Energy Transfer.
d)
 
Energy from other Off-System Purchases will be assigned to the Generating Parties based on the economics of the purchase. Where a new Off-System Purchase would be economic for both Generating Parties' Load Requirements over the appropriate time period, or is not assigned economically to any Generating Party, the energy from the Off-System Purchase shall be shared between the Generating Parties based on the ratio of the Load Requirements of the Generating Parties.

e)
 
Energy from one Party's Generating Resources utilized by the other Generating Party to serve that Party's Load Requirements shall be called System Energy Transfer. Where After-the-Fact Resource Allocation identifies a System Energy Transfer as the source to supply one Generating Party's Load Requirements, the determination of cost for the System Energy Transfer and reimbursement shall be made pursuant to Service Schedule A, System Energy Transfer.
f)
 
Energy from Off-System Purchases may be assigned by the After-the-Fact Resource Allocation or designated by the Agent to be used to supply Off-System Sales. The actual cost of the Off-System Purchase shall be deducted from the energy revenue collected from the Off-System Sale. The net amount shall be included in the calculation of the Off-System Sales Margin.
g)
 
Energy from the Generating Parties' Generating Resources which is not assigned to any Party's Load Requirements shall be assigned to Off-System Sales according to established priorities. The cost of the energy assigned to Off-System Sales shall be the Incremental Cost of the Generating Resources used to supply the sale. This cost shall be deducted from the energy revenue collected from the Off-System Sale. The net amount shall be included in the calculation of Off-System Sales Margin.

C1 - Duration.
This Service Schedule C shall become effective and binding when the Joint Dispatch Agreement becomes effective, and shall continue in full force and effect throughout the duration of such Agreement. This Service Schedule C is a part of the Agreement and, as such, the use of terms in this Service Schedule C that are defined in the Agreement shall have the same respective meanings as set forth in the Agreement.
C2 - Applicability.
In accordance with the terms of Articles V and VI of the Agreement, the Combined System shall be centrally dispatched on an economic dispatch basis and shall engage in economical Off-System Purchases as a single Control Area. The cost of the energy from the Parties' Generating Resources to supply System Energy Transfer is the Incremental Cost of the energy which may include emissions allowance cost. This Service Schedule C defines the methodology for determining the emissions allowance cost.
C3 -- Emissions Allowance Recovery Mechanism.
The emissions allowance cost used in the computation of Incremental Cost shall be the replacement cost of emissions allowances. The emissions allowance replacement cost will be the "Monthly Price Index" published by Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Service by the twenty-fifth day of the month prior to the month the transaction occurs. The Parties will use the Cantor Fitzgerald index unless one or both

of the Parties is involved in the actual purchase or sale of allowances wherein it may choose at its option to use the price of its own transactions, such transactions to have a minimum allowance quantity of 1,000 allowances. Although the Parties have designated Cantor Fitzgerald as the index to be used in establishing emissions allowance cost, the Parties will continue to evaluate other market indicators. The Parties may in the future designate another index to serve as the incremental price indicator.
The allowance replacement cost, in $/SO
2
ton, will be used to calculate a Generating Unit's incremental SO

cost as described below. The incremental SO

cost of operating an affected unit will be calculated using three components -- the allowance replacement cost, the unit's incremental heat rate and the SO

rate of the fuel used at the unit.
