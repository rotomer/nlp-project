FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ST. LOUIS, MO., Jan. 17, 2006Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today updated its 2005 earnings guidance and announced its expectations for earnings in 2006. The company expects its 2005 earnings, before the adoption of a new accounting standard, to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.15 per share, within its previous guidance range of $3.00 to $3.20. Amerens guidance for 2005 is subject to completion of year-end reporting processes and excludes an expected after-tax charge of approximately $20 million associated with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires Ameren to record additional asset retirement obligations associated with its non-rate-regulated electric generating operations.
   
 
 For 2006, the company expects earnings will be in the range of $2.95 to $3.25 per share. Amerens guidance for 2006 assumes normal weather and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.
   
 
 "Compared to 2005, earnings in 2006 are expected to benefit from the lack of a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant, continued solid power markets, improved plant operations and organic growth in our service territory, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Ameren Corporation
   
. However, we anticipate that earnings in 2006 will be negatively impacted by increased coal and related transportation costs and the lack of the availability of our 440 megawatt Taum Sauk pumped-storage plant. Rainwater added that the company expects to incur higher depreciation and related financing costs in 2006, due to significant rate-regulated generation plant additions in 2005 and 2006, and expects to experience higher expenses for employee benefits and bad debts in 2006.

 Ameren also announced today that it expects its 2006 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion, including $290 million associated with the previously announced acquisitions of 1,490 megawatts of combustion turbine generating facilities for its regulated AmerenUE operations. These acquisitions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
   
 
 Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Tuesday, Jan. 17, to discuss updated 2005 earnings guidance, 2006 earnings guidance, regulatory proceedings and other matters related to the company.

A slide presentation will also be available on Amerens Web site that reconciles 2006 earnings guidance to updated 2005 earnings guidance. In addition, this presentation includes information related to our updated 2005 earnings guidance, as well as information on regulatory and other matters that will be discussed during the conference call. This presentation will be posted in the Investors section of the Web site under Presentations. The analyst call will also be available for replay on the Internet for one year. Telephone playback of the conference call will also be available beginning at 11:30 a.m. noon (Central Time), from Jan. 17 through Jan. 24, by dialing, U.S. (800) 405-2236; international (303) 590-3000 and entering the number: 11051095#.
