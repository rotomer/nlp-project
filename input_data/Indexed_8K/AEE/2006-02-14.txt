FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Feb. 14, 2006Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2005 net income, including a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, of $606 million, or $3.02 per share, compared to net income of $
530 milli
on, or $2.84 per share, in 2004.
Ameren recorded net income,
including a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,
of $20 million, or 10 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $83 million, or 42 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Amerens net income for 2005 includes an after-tax cumulative effect charge of approximately $22 million, or 11 cents per share, related to its non-rate-regulated operations, associated with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. Excluding this item, adjusted (non-GAAP) income was $628 million or $3.13 per share, for the full year of 2005, and $42 million, or 21 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Improved operating earnings in 2005 resulted from the successful integration of Illinois Power Company and greater availability of our low-cost coal-fired power plants. This availability allowed us to enhance operating margins as we supplied increased native load demand resulting from warmer summer weather and took advantage of higher power prices on short-term energy sales, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Ameren Corporation. In addition, operating earnings benefited from organic growth in our service territory and from the sale of certain assets from our leveraged lease portfolio. These benefits more than offset increased fuel and purchased power expenses, including higher costs of operating in the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) Day Two energy market.
 
Revenues in 2005 increased $1.6 billion to $6.8 billion compared to 2004. The Sept. 30, 2004, acquisition of Illinois Power Company added revenues of $1.3 billion in 2005. In addition, warm

summer weather increased residential and commercial electric sales, and industrial electric sales benefited from the addition of Noranda Aluminum, Inc., the largest energy user in the state of Missouri, as a customer beginning June 1, 2005.
 
Cooling degree days in 2005 were approximately 37 percent above a mild 2004, according to the National Weather Service. Excluding the effect of the Illinois Power Company acquisition, weather-sensitive residential electric megawatthour sales increased 10 percent, and commercial electric megawatthour sales increased 3 percent, in 2005 compared to 2004. It is estimated that weather benefited 2005 earnings by 26 cents per share as compared to 2004.
 
Interchange revenues rose 19 percent in 2005 compared to 2004, due to higher power prices and access to the MISO Day Two energy market. In 2005, interchange revenues averaged $44 per megawatthour versus $30 per megawatthour in 2004. These factors more than offset the 19 percent decrease in year-over-year interchange sales in 2005. Interchange sales were lower in 2005 due largely to less excess power being available for sale as a result of the addition of Noranda Aluminum as a customer, increased residential and commercial native load demand, due principally to warmer weather, and coal conservation efforts required as a result of disruptions in coal deliveries.
 
Fuel and purchased power costs increased in 2005 over 2004, due to the addition of Illinois Power Company, increased sales, higher coal and related transportation costs and the incremental costs of operating in the MISO Day Two energy market. Incremental MISO costs reduced 2005 earnings by an estimated 29 cents per share compared to 2004.
 
Illinois Power Company contributed incremental net income of $68 million to Amerens earnings in 2005. Accretion from this acquisition and dilution from common shares issued by Ameren in advance of the September 2004 completion of the Illinois Power Company acquisition resulted in an estimated 23 cent increase in 2005 earnings per share.
 
 
A highlight of 2005 was the successful completion of the refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway nuclear plant -
the most extensive in Callaways history, added Rainwater. During the outage, which was one of the most efficient and effective outages in the plants history, we refueled the plant and replaced the steam generators and turbine rotors in 63  days, positioning the plant very well for the future. 
 
Fourth quarter 2005 net income was reduced by 14 cents per share due to the Callaway outage. The 2004 refueling and maintenance outage was performed in the second quarter. Net

income in the fourth quarter of 2005 was also negatively impacted by MISO-related expenses of 12 cents per share and a 10 cent per share reduction in native load and interchange margins, due to coal conservation measures and increased coal and related transportation costs. Sales of leveraged leases benefited fourth quarter 2005 net income by 11 cents per share compared to the year-ago period.
 
Ameren also announced today that it is reaffirming its 2006 earnings guidance. The company continues to expect 2006 earnings to range between $2.95 and $3.25 per share. Amerens guidance assumes normal weather for the full year and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this presentation on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share.
