FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ST. LOUIS, MO., May 4, 2006Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced first quarter 2006 net income of $70 million, or 34 cents per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $
   
121 milli
on, or 62 cents per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of 2005.
 
 Despite solid operations, our first quarter 2006 earnings fell short of the strong earnings we achieved last year, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Ameren Corporation. Several factors negatively impacted our earnings. Temperatures in our service territory during the 2006 winter season were extremely mild resulting in lower electric and gas margins. Our electric margins were also negatively impacted by higher fuel and purchased power costs due primarily to increased coal and related transportation costs. In addition, we incurred incremental costs of operating in the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator Inc. (MISO) Day Two Energy Market in the first quarter of 2006 because MISO Day Two operations didnt commence until the second quarter last year. These factors offset higher margins from organic growth and interchange sales compared to the first quarter of last year.
   
 
 Other operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes also rose, negatively affecting earnings for the quarter, Rainwater added. These expenses grew primarily as a result of higher gross receipts taxes, the absence of a favorable property tax settlement such as the one realized during the first quarter of 2005 and higher bad debt expenses.
   
 
 Revenues in the first quarter of 2006 increased to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion in the prior-year period primarily because of organic growth, interchange revenue increases and higher natural gas revenues that were driven by higher natural gas prices. These higher natural gas prices also contributed to a $99 million increase in the cost of gas purchased for resale. Heating degree days in the first quarter of 2006 were approximately 11 percent below a mild 2005 first quarter and 18 percent below normal, according to the National Weather Service. As a result, weather-sensitive
   
 
 
 
 
 
Add One
 
natural gas sales decreased 8 percent, and residential megawatthour sales decreased 2 percent in the 2006 first quarter from the mild 2005 first quarter. Weather is estimated to have reduced first quarter 2006 earnings by 4 cents per share versus 2005 and 7 cents per share versus normal weather conditions.
 
 
 
 Commercial electric megawatthour sales were flat in the first quarter of 2006 compared to 2005 as customer growth offset the effect of extremely mild weather. Industrial electric megawatthour sales increased 15 percent as a result of sales to Noranda Aluminum, which became a customer on June 1, 2005. Interchange sales increased 35 percent in the first quarter of 2006 over the same period a year ago due to increased sales by the companys 80 percent-owned unregulated subsidiary, Electric Energy, Inc. (EEI). EEIs interchange sales rose as a result of the Dec. 31, 2005, expiration of cost-based long-term power sales contracts with its affiliates for 1,000 megawatts that are now available for sale in the interchange markets.
   
 
 Fuel and purchased power costs increased $109 million in the first quarter of 2006 over the same period in 2005, due primarily to higher coal and related transportation costs and incremental costs of operating in the MISO Day Two Energy Market. Incremental MISO costs reduced first quarter 2006 earnings by approximately 6 cents per share versus the year-ago period. In addition, fuel and purchased power costs rose during the quarter due to the expiration of the cost-based EEI power contracts with its affiliates.
   
 
 Other operations and maintenance expenses increased $3 million in the first quarter of 2006 as compared to the first quarter of 2005, due primarily to higher bad debt expense. In addition, taxes other than income taxes increased $22 million in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005. Taxes were higher as a result of the absence in 2006 of the benefit of an $8 million property tax settlement realized in the first quarter of 2005 and increased gross receipts taxes in 2006.
   
 
 While we are off to a challenging start in 2006, we do anticipate improvements in our operating results, especially in the second half of 2006, added Rainwater. In the second half of the year, we expect, among other things, to realize the benefits from the lack of a Callaway refueling outage, fewer outages at our power plants, and lower MISO costs than in 2005. As a result, despite our slow start in 2006, we continue to expect to deliver solid earnings results for the year.
   
 
 Ameren also announced today that it is narrowing its 2006 earnings guidance. The company now expects 2006 earnings to range between $2.95 and $3.15 per share. Earnings per share
   
 
 
 
 
 
Add Two
 
guidance was narrowed due primarily to warmer-than-normal weather in the first quarter of 2006 and power prices for interchange sales for the remainder of 2006 which are anticipated to be lower than originally expected. Amerens guidance assumes normal weather for the rest of 2006 and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.
