Central Illinois Light Company
On June 14, 2006, Central Illinois Light Company, d/b/a AmerenCILCO ("CILCO"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameren Corporation, issued and sold $54,000,000 principal amount of its 6.20% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (the "Series 2016 Notes") and $42,000,000 principal amount of its 6.70% Senior Secured Notes due 2036 (the "Series 2036 Notes" and, together with the Series 2016 Notes, the "CILCO Notes") with registration rights in a private placement transaction. The CILCO Notes were issued under CILCO's Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 between CILCO and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "CILCO Indenture"). The Series 2016 Notes will mature on
June 15
, 20
16 and the Series 2036 Notes will mature on June 15, 2036
. CILCO will pay interest on the CILCO Notes on
June 15
and
December 15
of each year. The first such payment will be made on
December 15
, 2006. CILCO may at any time and from time to time redeem all or a portion of the CILCO Notes at a make-whole redemption price. CILCO will use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the CILCO Notes to redeem prior to maturity $20,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its secured medium-term notes 7.73% Series due 2025 and has used the balance of such net proceeds to repay short-term debt.
Until the release date, the Series 2016 Notes and the Series 2036 Notes will each be secured by a related series of CILCO's first mortgage bonds issued under the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of April 1, 1933 between Illinois Power Company, CILCO's predecessor in interest, and Bankers Trust Company (predecessor to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas), as mortgage trustee (the "CILCO Mortgage"). Accordingly, until the release date, the CILCO Notes will be secured ratably with CILCO's first mortgage bonds in the collateral pledged to secure such bonds. The release date will be the date that all of CILCO's first mortgage bonds issued and outstanding under the CILCO Mortgage, other than the first mortgage bonds securing the CILCO Notes or other first mortgage bonds securing related senior secured debt securities of CILCO issued under the CILCO Indenture, have been retired. CILCO has agreed that so long as any of the CILCO Notes are outstanding, it will not, prior to June 15, 2009, optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding first mortgage bonds not subject to release provisions. Accordingly, under this covenant, so long as any of the CILCO Notes remain outstanding, the release date will occur no earlier than June 15, 2009.
The CILCO Indenture contains default provisions relating to failure to make required payments
on any senior secured debt securities of CILCO (including the CILCO Notes) when due and payable, default in the performance or breach of any other covenants of CILCO for 60 days after notice, certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, and,
prior to the release date, the occurrence of a default under the CILCO Mortgage. The CILCO Mortgage contains default provisions relating to failure to make required payments on any outstanding first mortgage bonds, default in the performance of other covenants for 90 days after notice and certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership.
If an event of default under the CILCO Indenture occurs and is continuing, the trustee under the CILCO Indenture, or the holders of 33% of the outstanding
senior secured debt securities of CILCO (including the CILCO Notes)
, may declare the principal and interest on such senior secured debt securities due and payable immediately. Upon such acceleration, the first mortgage bonds securing the CILCO Notes and any other first mortgage bonds securing senior secured debt securities of CILCO will
2
be immediately redeemable upon demand of the trustee, and surrender thereof to the mortgage trustee, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with interest to the redemption date.
CILCO has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement and/or, under certain circumstances, a shelf registration statement pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the CILCO Notes. If CILCO fails to comply with certain obligations under the registration rights agreement, it will be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 0.25% per year on the CILCO Notes for the period of non-compliance (plus an additional 0.25% per year from and during any period in which such non-compliance continues for more than 90 days, up to a maximum rate of 0.50% per year).
Illinois Power Company

June 15
and
December 15
of each year. The first such payment will be made on
December 15
, 2006. IP may at any time and from time to time redeem all or a portion of the IP Notes at a make-whole redemption price. IP used the net proceeds from the sale of the IP Notes to repay short-term debt.
Until the release date, the IP Notes will be secured by a related series of IP's mortgage bonds issued and delivered by IP to the trustee under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of November 1, 1992 between IP and Harris Trust and Savings Bank (predecessor to BNY Midwest Trust Company), as mortgage trustee (the "IP Mortgage"). Accordingly, until the release date, the IP Notes will be secured ratably with IP's mortgage bonds in the collateral pledged to secure such bonds. The release date will be the date that all of IP's mortgage bonds issued and outstanding under the IP Mortgage, other than the mortgage bonds securing the IP Notes or other mortgage bonds securing related senior secured debt securities of IP under the IP Indenture, have been retired.
The IP Indenture contains default provisions relating to failure to make required payments
on any senior secured debt securities of IP when due and payable (including the IP Notes), default in the performance or breach of any other covenants of IP for 60 days after notice, certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, and,
prior to the release date, the occurrence of a default under the IP Mortgage. The IP Mortgage contains default provisions relating to failure to make required payments on any outstanding mortgage bonds, default in the performance of other covenants for 60 days after notice and certain events in reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership.
If an event of default under the IP Indenture occurs and is continuing, the trustee under the IP Indenture, or the holders of 33% of the outstanding
senior secured debt securities of IP (including the IP Notes)
, may declare the principal and interest on such senior secured debt securities due and payable immediately. Upon such acceleration, the mortgage bonds securing the IP Notes and any other mortgage bonds securing senior secured debt securities of IP will be immediately redeemable upon demand of the trustee, and surrender thereof to the mortgage trustee, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with interest to the redemption date.

IP has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement and/or, under certain circumstances, a shelf registration statement pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the IP Notes. If IP fails to comply with certain obligations under the registration rights agreement, it will be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 0.25% per year on the IP Notes for the period of non-compliance (plus an additional 0.25% per year from and during any period in which such non-compliance continues for more than 90 days, up to a maximum rate of 0.50% per year).

Ladies and Gentlemen:
From time to time, Central Illinois Public Service Company, d/b/a AmerenCIPS, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each, a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its senior secured notes (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities"). The Designated Securities will be secured by a series of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "First Mortgage Bonds") in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date and other terms as the Designated Securities to which they relate.
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities (including the First Mortgage Bonds securing such Designated Securities) shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Indenture dated as of December 1, 1998 (as supplemented or amended, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"). The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Company's Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated October 1, 1941, executed by the Company to U.S. Bank  National Association, as successor trustee (the "Corporate Trustee"), and Patrick J. Crowley, as successor co-trustee (the "Co-Trustee" and, together with the Corporate Trustee and the Trustee, the "Trustees"), as heretofore amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, and as to be further amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture relating to a particular series of First Mortgage
 
Bonds specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Supplemental Indenture"). The term "Mortgage," as used herein, shall be deemed to refer to such Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust as so amended and supplemented.
1.         Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters or to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the title and aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the series of First Mortgage Bonds securing such Designated Securities, the Supplemental Indenture relating to such First Mortgage Bonds, the Time of Sale (as defined herein) with respect to such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, if any,  and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in or pursuant to the Indenture and the registration statement, preliminary prospectus and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

8.         The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
(a)           The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) and Rule 430A, Rule 430B or Rule 430C within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission under the Act (in the case of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Act); if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Underwriting Agreement or the date of such Pricing Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering of the Designated Securities shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction;

(d)           The Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters the written opinion of Sorling, Northrup, Hanna, Cullen and Cochran, Ltd., Illinois legal counsel for such Company, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto (i) with such changes therein as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Underwriters with the approval of counsel for the Underwriters, and (ii) if the Time of Sale Information shall be supplemented after being furnished to the Underwriters for use in offering the Designated Securities, with changes therein to reflect such supplementation.
(e)           On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date of such Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;

14
affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
(g)           On or prior to the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received satisfactory evidence that the Designated Securities have received ratings of A- or higher by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and A3 or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and that such ratings are in effect at the Time of Delivery;

(j)            The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Underwriting Agreement or next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement, as applicable;

15
such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and
(l)            The ICC Order shall be in full force and effect at the Time of Delivery.
If any of the events specified in Sections 8(f), 8(h) or 8(i) hereof shall have occurred or the representation in Section 2(s) is incorrect in any respect, the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities may be terminated by the Representatives on notice to the Company at any time on or prior to the Time of Delivery and upon such notice being given, the parties hereto and thereto shall be released and discharged from their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder (except for the liability of the Company pursuant to Sections 6 or 12 hereof and the obligations of the parties hereto and thereto pursuant to Section 9 hereof). Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
9.         (a)  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or, in the case of any action arising out of the issuance and sale of the Securities, in any prior registration statement to which the Prospectus, as a combined prospectus under Rule 429 under the Act, relates), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed under Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement.
(b)       Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
16
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c)       Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in any such action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of any such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent
17
to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d)       If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be
pro rata
18
entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e)       The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10.       (a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Underwriting Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
(b)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting
19
Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c)       If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11.       The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Underwriting Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12.       If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof.
13.       In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile
20
transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
14.       This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Underwriting Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15.       Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. As used herein, "New York Business Day" shall mean any day other than Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banks located in the State of New York are authorized or obligated to close.
16.       This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
17.       This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
18.       The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriters are advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

[LETTERHEAD OF CENTRAL ILLINOIS PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY]
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York  10013 Goldman, Sachs & Co. 85 Broad Street New York, New York  10004
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Central Illinois Public Service Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), and, together with Sorling, Northrup, Hanna, Cullen and Cochran, Ltd., have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $61,500,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.70% Senior Secured Notes due 2036 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement between Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as your Representatives (the "Representatives"), and the Company dated June 8, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") and a Pricing Agreement between the Representatives and the Company dated June 8, 2006 (the "Pricing Agreement").
The Notes are being issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of December 1, 1998 (as supplemented and amended as of the date hereof, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes will be secured by the Company's First Mortgage Bonds designated "First Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes Series CC" (the "First Mortgage Bonds") in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date as the Notes which they secure. The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Company's Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated October 1, 1941, executed by the Company to U.S. Bank National Association, as successor trustee, and Patrick J. Crowley, as successor co-trustee, as heretofore amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, and as now being further amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") dated as of June 1, 2006 (as so supplemented and amended pursuant to the terms thereof, the "Mortgage"). Unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized
A-
1
terms used in this opinion shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion is being furnished pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement.
I have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of: (1) resolutions adopted at the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company on April 24, 2001 and June 8, 2006 in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes and the issuance of the First Mortgage Bonds; (2) the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement; (3) the Indenture; (4) the Mortgage; (5) the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-59438), as amended, as of the latest date as of which any part of such registration statement relating to the Notes became, or is deemed to have become, effective under the Act in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the Act (collectively, the "Registration Statement"); (6) the prospectus dated May 2, 2001 as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 1, 2006, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (collectively, the "Preliminary Prospectus"); (7) the pricing term sheet dated June 8, 2006 relating to the Notes (the "Pricing Term Sheet"); (8) the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus dated June 8, 2006,  (together with the Preliminary Prospectus and the Pricing Term Sheet, the "Time of Sale Information"); (8) the prospectus dated May 2, 2001 as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated June 8, 2006, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (collectively, the "Prospectus"); and (9) such other documents, certificates, instruments and records as I have considered necessary or appropriate for purposes of the opinion contained herein. In addition, I have discussed and conferred with officers and employees of the Company and its affiliates and made such investigation of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of said opinion. Lastly, in rendering this opinion, I have relied as to factual matters upon certificates or written statements from appropriate representatives of the Company or upon certificates of public officials.
I am of the opinion that:
(i)               The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Illinois, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus; and the Company is not required by the nature of its business to be licensed or qualified as a foreign corporation in any other state or jurisdiction;
(ii)              To the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, and other than as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or of which any property of the Company is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or others; there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the
A-
2
Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit (either thereto or to a document incorporated therein by reference), that is not described or filed as required; and the statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus describing any legal proceedings or material contracts or agreements relating to the Company fairly summarize such matters;
(iii)             The Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(iv)             The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, except as may be limited by the Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefit of the security afforded by the Indenture;
(v)              The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by the Exceptions; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
(vi)             The First Mortgage Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Corporate Trustee and upon delivery in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage and the Supplemental Indenture, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, except as may be limited by the Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefit of the security afforded by the Mortgage equally and ratably with all other mortgage bonds issued under the Mortgage;
(vii)            The Mortgage (including the Supplemental Indenture) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to provisions of the Mortgage being limited by the laws of the State of Illinois affecting the remedies for the enforcement of the security provided for therein, which laws do not, in my opinion, make inadequate remedies necessary for the realization of the benefits of such security and except as may be limited by the Exceptions; and the Mortgage has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
A-

(viii)           The issue of the First Mortgage Bonds and the issue and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the First Mortgage Bonds, the Mortgage, the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Notes and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject, which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties;
(ix)              The Illinois Commerce Commission has duly authorized the issue and sale of the Notes by the Company and the issue of the First Mortgage Bonds by the Company pursuant to the ICC Order; the ICC Order is in full force and effect and is sufficient to authorize the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement to the extent authorization is required; the Notes and the First Mortgage Bonds issued pursuant to the ICC Order are valid and binding in accordance with their respective terms and the terms and limitations specified in the ICC Order, notwithstanding the ICC Order being later vacated, modified or otherwise held to be invalid by a reviewing court subsequent to the issuance of the Notes and the First Mortgage Bonds; no other consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Notes and the issue of the First Mortgage Bonds by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement or the Indenture or the Mortgage, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and except such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by you (as to which I express no opinion);
(x)               The Company is not (i) in violation of its By-laws or Restated Articles of Incorporation or (ii) to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound;
A-
4
(xi)              The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes, the Company will not be, an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
(xii)             The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no belief), when they were filed with the Commission complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and I have no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they were so filed contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading;
(xiii)            The Registration Statement, as of the date as of which any part of the Registration Statement is deemed to have become effective under the Act in accordance with Section 11(d) of the Act and Rule 430B of the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, as of the date each was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (in each case, other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no belief), complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or pursuant to said regulations is deemed to comply therewith;
(xiv)           Although I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in paragraph (xviii) of this opinion and those that relate to me, I have no reason to believe that (1) the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no belief), as of the date as of which any part of the Registration Statement is deemed to have become effective under the Act in accordance with Section 11(d) of the Act and Rule 430B of the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
A-
5
statements therein not misleading, (2) the Time of Sale Information (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no belief), at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (3) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no belief), as of its date or on the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; the Registration Statement has become, and as of the date hereof is, effective under the Act;
(xv)            Any required filing of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, has been made in the manner and within the time period required by the applicable paragraph of such Rule 424(b); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, threatened under Section 8 or Section 8A of the Act;
(xvi)           The delivery to the Trustee in the State of New York of the First Mortgage Bonds is effective to perfect the security interest in the First Mortgage Bonds on the date of such delivery and, to the best of my knowledge, such security interest, is not subject to any prior liens;

(xviii)         The statements set forth in the preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 7, 2006 to the Prospectus (together with the information set forth in the Time of Sale Information) and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Senior Secured Notes," "Description of Senior Notes" and "Description of Senior Note Mortgage Bonds", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes are accurate summaries in all material respects; and
(xix)            The statements in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus that are stated therein to have been made on my authority have been reviewed by me and, as to matters of law and legal conclusions, are correct.
To the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, there is no litigation, pending or threatened, that challenges the validity of the Notes, the Indenture, the First Mortgage Bonds, the Mortgage, the Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement, or that seeks to enjoin the performance of the Company's obligations thereunder or that might have a Material Adverse Effect except as disclosed in or contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.

I regularly practice before the Illinois Commerce Commission and, therefore, am qualified to render the opinion set forth in paragraph (ix) above as an expert on the laws of the State of Illinois for such purpose.

The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. 911 Washington Avenue, Suite 300 St. Louis, Missouri 63101
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Central Illinois Public Service Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $61,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the its 6.70% Senior Notes due 2036 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement between Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as Representatives of the several Underwriters (the "Representatives"), and the Company dated June 8, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") and a Pricing Agreement between the Representatives and the Company dated June 8, 2006. The Notes are being issued pursuant to the Indenture dated as of December 1, 1998 (as supplemented and amended as of the date hereof, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Copmpany, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes will be secured by the Company's First Mortgage Bonds designated "First Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes Series CC" (the "First Mortgage Bonds") in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date as the Notes to which they relate. The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust dated October 1, 1941, as heretofore amended and supplemented, and as now being further amended and supplemented by a Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (formerly First Trust National Association formerly First Trust of Illinois, National Association, successor to Bank of America Illinois), as trustee, and Patrick J. Crowley, as successor co-trustee. Said Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, as amended and supplemented through and including the Supplemental Indenture, is herein referred to as the "Mortgage."  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have their respective meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion is furnished to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement and to the Trustee pursuant to Sections 2.05(c)(2) and 6.05 of the Indenture.

Based upon our examination of such documents, records and matters of law as we have considered to be relevant in the premises, it is our opinion that:
(1)           The statements in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus that are stated therein to have been made on our authority have been reviewed by us and, as to matters of law and legal conclusions, are correct.
(2)           The Company has good and sufficient title to all or substantially all the permanent fixed properties and the material franchises, permits and licenses now owned by it, including those described or referred to in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, except as may be otherwise indicated therein, and no notice has been given to the Company by any governmental authority of any proceeding to condemn, purchase or otherwise acquire any material properties of the Company and, so far as we know, no such proceeding is contemplated.
(3)           The Mortgage has been duly filed for recording and recorded in each county in the State of Illinois in which any permanent fixed property described in and conveyed by the Mortgage and now owned by the Company is located, and constitutes a legally valid and direct enforceable first mortgage lien (except as federal bankruptcy laws may affect the validity of the lien of the Mortgage with respect to proceeds, products, rents, issues or profits of the property subject to such lien realized and additional property acquired within 90 days prior to and after the commencement of a case under such laws and except as enforcement of provisions thereof may be limited by the laws of the State of Illinois affecting the remedies for the enforcement of the security provided for in the Mortgage, which laws do not, in our opinion, make such remedies inadequate for realization of the benefits of such security, or limited by bankruptcy or insolvency laws of or other applicable laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity) upon substantially all of the Company's fixed properties and franchises used or useful in its public utility businesses free from all prior or equal ranking liens, charges or encumbrances, subject only to permitted encumbrances and liens, as defined in the Mortgage, and to the provisions contained in the Mortgage for the release, or substitution and release, of property from the lien thereof.
(4)           No recordation, registration or filing of the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or instrument of further assurance is necessary in the State of Illinois to make effective the security interest intended to be created by the Indenture with respect to the First Mortgage Bonds.
(5)           Substantially all physical properties and franchises used or useful in the Company's public utility businesses (other than certain properties expressly reserved from the lien and effect of the Mortgage in the Granting Clause thereof) and now owned by the Company are subject to the lien of the Mortgage, subject only to permitted encumbrances and liens, as defined in the Mortgage, and to the provisions contained in the Mortgage for the release, or substitution and release, of property from the lien thereof. All physical properties and franchises used or useful in the Company's public utility businesses (other than certain properties expressly reserved from the lien and effect of the Mortgage in the Granting Clause thereof) hereafter acquired by the Company and situated in counties in the State of Illinois in which the Mortgage
B-
2
shall be of record will, upon such acquisition, become subject to the lien of the Mortgage, subject, however, to such encumbrances and liens as are permitted thereby.
In rendering this opinion, (a) we have relied upon certificates of officers of the Company as to matters of fact relevant to this opinion and (b) we have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine. In giving Opinions 2 and 3 above, we have relied on prior opinions given by Nafziger & Otten as to matters of titles to properties acquired by the Company prior to May 14, 1980, and as to filings or recordings of the Mortgage prior to May 14, 1980. We have examined such opinions and, without conducting any independent investigation, have no reason to believe that any of the conclusions expressed therein are incorrect in any material respect and believe that such opinions are satisfactory in form and scope.

If and to the extent that the Company fails to make timely payment or provision for timely payment of interest on any series of Notes (other than on an Interest Payment Date that is a Maturity date), that interest shall cease to be payable to the Persons who were the Noteholders of such series at the applicable Regular Record Date. In that event, when moneys become available for payment of the interest, the Trustee shall (a) establish a date of payment of such interest and a Special Record Date for the payment of that interest, which Special Record Date shall be not more than 15 or fewer than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and (b) mail notice of the date of payment and of the Special Record Date not fewer than 10 days preceding the Special Record Date to each Noteholder of such series at the close of business on the 15th day preceding the mailing at the address of such Noteholder, as it appeared on the register for the Notes.

Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series and any other outstanding series of Notes. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered.

Prior to the Release Date (as hereinafter defined), the Notes will be secured by first mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1933, from the Company to THE BANK OF NEW YORK TRUST COMPANY, N.A., as successor trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "FIRST MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the First Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of first mortgage bonds, under the First Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional first mortgage bonds may be issued.

Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.

If any Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid is not a Business Day, then payment of principal, premium or interest need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid and, in the case of timely payment thereof, no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid.
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture and, upon such declaration, the Trustee shall demand the redemption of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds to the extent provided in the Indenture.

Such register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time.

13
number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Note so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the Company, the Trustee and any paying agent or Authenticating Agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft of a Note, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.

Upon the issuance of any substituted Note, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. If any Note which has matured, is about to mature or has been called for redemption shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substituted Note, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company, the Trustee and any paying agent or Authenticating Agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.
(c)           Every substituted Note issued pursuant to this Section 2.07 by virtue of the fact that any Note is mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not such destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder. All Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude to the full extent permitted by applicable law any and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.08           .

Temporary Notes shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive Notes but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Notes, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Note shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Notes. Without unreasonable delay the Company shall execute and shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Notes of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Notes of such series shall be surrendered in exchange therefor at the corporate trust office of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall authenticate, deliver and register in exchange for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes of such series. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor to the Noteholders. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes of such series shall in all respects be entitled to the same
Temporary Notes

benefits under this Indenture as definitive Notes of such series authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 2.09           . All Notes surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer shall be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation and promptly cancelled by it and no Notes shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.

Interest Rights Preserved
Section 2.11           . If and to the extent that the Company fails to make timely payment or provision for timely payment of interest on any series of Notes (other than on an Interest Payment Date that is a Maturity date), that interest shall cease to be payable to the Persons who were the Noteholders of such series at the applicable Regular Record Date. In that event, when moneys become available for payment of the interest, the Trustee shall (a) establish a date of payment of such interest and a Special Record Date for the payment of that interest, which Special Record Date shall be not more than 15 or fewer than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and (b) mail notice of the date of payment and of the Special Record Date not fewer than 10 days preceding the Special Record Date to each Noteholder of such series at the close of business on the 15th day preceding the mailing at the address of such Noteholder, as it appeared on the register for the Notes.

Subject to Article XIII hereof, all payments made by or on behalf of the Company to the Trustee on a series of Senior Note Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company pursuant to this Section 2.12 and shall be applied by the Trustee to pay, when due, principal of, premium, if any, and/or interest on the Related Series of Notes and, to the extent so applied, shall satisfy the Company's obligations on such Notes. The Company shall cause payment to be made to the Trustee of principal of, premium, if any, and (if applicable) interest on a series of Senior Note Mortgage Bonds in a manner and at a time that will enable the Trustee to make payments when due, of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Related Series of Notes.

Payment of the principal of and interest and premium on this Note shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) of the Indenture.
This Note is a Global Note in respect of a duly authorized issue of Senior Notes,       % Due          (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES", which term includes any Global Notes representing such Notes) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series and any other outstanding series of Notes. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof, in the aggregate principal amount of $              .
Prior to the Release Date (as hereinafter defined), the Notes will be secured by mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992, from the Company to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of mortgage bonds, under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional mortgage bonds may be issued.
From and after such time as all mortgage bonds (other than Senior Note Mortgage Bonds) issued under the Mortgage have been retired through payment, redemption or otherwise at, before or after the maturity thereof (the "Release Date"), the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure the Notes in any manner. In certain circumstances prior to the Release Date as provided in the Indenture, the Company is permitted to reduce the aggregate principal
A-

amount of a series of Senior Note Mortgage Bonds held by the Trustee, but in no event prior to the Release Date to an amount less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the series of Notes initially issued contemporaneously with such Senior Note Mortgage Bonds.
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
[Insert redemption provisions, if any]
Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (and for any partial periods shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months). If any Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid is not a Business Day, then payment of principal, premium or interest need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid and, in the case of timely payment thereof, no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid.
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture and, upon such declaration, the Trustee shall demand the redemption of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds to the extent provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifications of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series and any other outstanding series of Notes. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $                 .

Notes. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof in the aggregate principal amount of $61,500,000.
, as trustees (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEES"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "FIRST MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the First Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of first mortgage bonds, under the First Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustees in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustees and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional first mortgage bonds may be issued.
Prior to the Release Date (as hereinafter defined), the Notes will be secured by first mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated October 1, 1941, from the Company to
U.S. Bank National Association
and Patrick J. Crowley
From and after such time as all first mortgage bonds (other than Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds) issued under the First Mortgage have been retired through payment, redemption or otherwise at, before or after the maturity thereof (the "Release Date"), the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure the Notes in any manner. In certain circumstances prior to the Release Date as provided in the Indenture, the Company is permitted to reduce the aggregate principal amount of a series of Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds held by the Trustee, but in no event prior to the Release Date to an amount less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the series of Notes initially issued contemporaneously with such Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds.
So long as any of the Notes of this Series are outstanding, the Company will not, prior to June 15, 2009, optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds not subject to the release provisions of the Indenture.
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 30 basis points,
A-

as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes of this Series.
"COMPARABLE TREASURY PRICE" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER" means (A) Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER QUOTATIONS" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.

Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (and for any partial periods shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months). If any Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid is not a Business Day, then payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid and, in the case of timely payment thereof, no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid.
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture and, upon such declaration, the Trustee shall demand the redemption of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds to the extent provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifications of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
As set forth in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such Notes, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes affected by such Event of Default shall have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium, or interest on, this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed here.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note may be transferred only as permitted by the legend hereto and the provisions of the Indenture.

The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. 911 Washington Avenue, Suite 300 St. Louis, Missouri 63101
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Application is hereby made to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), under the Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between Central Illinois Light Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), and the Trustee for the authentication and delivery of $54,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.20% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (the "Senior Notes Series 2016") and $42,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.70% Senior Secured Notes due 2036 (the "Senior Notes Series 2036", and together with the Senior Notes Series 2016, the "Notes"), pursuant to the provisions of Article II of the Indenture. On or after the Release Date, the Company, in its discretion, may change the descriptive title of the Notes to delete the word "Secured" from such descriptive title. Additional Notes without limitation as to amount, and without the consent of the holders of the then Outstanding Notes, may also be authenticated and delivered in the manner provided in Section 2.05 of the Indenture. All capitalized terms not defined herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the same meaning as used in the Indenture.
The Notes will be initially issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in the form of Global Notes registered in the name of Cede & Co. (as nominee for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), New York, New York, which will act as the Depositary for the Global Notes). Pursuant to Section 2.05(c) of the Indenture, the Senior Notes Series 2016 will have the terms set forth in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit A and in the form of definitive Note attached hereto as Exhibit B (which terms are incorporated by reference in this Company Order) and the Senior Notes Series 2036 will have the terms set forth in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit C and in the form of definitive Note attached hereto as Exhibit D (which terms are incorporated by reference in this Company Order). The Global Notes shall bear the depository legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibits A and C attached hereto. The Notes will be issued only in denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Initially, beneficial interests in the Senior Notes Series 2016 and the Senior Notes Series 2036 offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) ("QIBs") in reliance upon Rule 144A under the Securities Act will be represented by one or more separate Global Notes (each, a "Rule 144A Global Certificate") registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC and shall include the non-registration and registration rights legends set forth in Exhibits A and C attached hereto,
respectively, and beneficial interests in the Senior Notes Series 2016 and the Senior Notes Series 2036 offered and sold to purchasers pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will be evidenced by one or more separate Global Notes (each, a "Regulation S Global Certificate") and will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC for the accounts of The Euroclear System ("Euroclear") or Clearstream Banking, Luxembourg, socit anonyme ("Clearstream") and shall include the Regulation S and registration rights legends set forth in Exhibits A and C attached hereto, respectively. Senior Notes Series 2016 and Senior Notes Series 2036 offered and sold to institutional "accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) who are not QIBs and who are not purchasers pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will be in definitive form in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits B and D, respectively, and shall include the non-registration and registration rights legends set forth therein. The Trustee and the Company will have no responsibility or liability for any aspect of transfers of beneficial interests in the Notes (which transfers will be conducted pursuant to the customary procedures of DTC), any records of DTC of beneficial interests or any transactions between DTC and its participants or between any such participants and any other beneficial owners or for monitoring, supervising or reviewing of any thereof.
Transfers of beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificates will be subject to the restrictions on transfer contained in the non-registration legend set forth in Exhibits A and C hereto. Prior to the expiration of the period of 40 consecutive days beginning on and including the later of (x) the day on which the offering of the Notes commences and (y) the original issue date of the Notes (the "Distribution Compliance Period"), transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Certificate will be subject to the restrictions on transfer contained in the Regulation S legend set forth in Exhibits A and C hereto. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Certificate will not be subject to any restrictions and beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Certificate may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream.
In connection with any transfer of Notes, the Trustee and the Company shall be under no duty to inquire into, may conclusively presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in relying upon the certificates and other information (set forth in the forms of definitive Senior Notes Series 2016 and Senior Notes Series 2036 attached hereto as Exhibits B and D, respectively, for use in connection with the transfer of the Notes in definitive form, or set forth in Exhibits A-1 and C-1 attached hereto, for use in connection with the transfer of beneficial interests between a Rule 144A Global Certificate and a Regulation S Global Certificate or to a Senior Note Series 2016 or a Senior Note Series 2036 in definitive form, or otherwise) received from the Holders and any transferees of any Notes regarding the validity, legality and due authorization of any such transfer, the eligibility of the transferee to receive such Note and any other facts and circumstances related to such transfer. Transfers of beneficial interests between a Rule 144A Global Certificate and a Regulation S Global Certificate, and other transfers relating to beneficial interests in the Notes in global form, shall be reflected by endorsements of the Trustee, as custodian for DTC, on the schedule attached to such certificate.
The Company has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of June 14, 2006 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the initial purchasers of the Notes pursuant to
2
which the Notes that are issued and sold without registration (the "Private Notes") under the Securities Act may be exchanged for Notes that will be registered under the Securities Act and that will otherwise have substantially the same terms as the Private Notes (the "Exchange Notes"), except that such Exchange Notes will be issued in the forms of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibits A and C and will bear all customary legends (except for the non-registration, Regulation S and registration rights legends) or, in lieu of such exchange, the Company has agreed to file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Notes (in which case any Notes so resold will be issued in the forms of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibits A and C and bear all customary legends (except for the non-registration, Regulation S and registration rights legends)). The Private Notes will be exchanged for Exchange Notes only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and otherwise in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture. The Private Notes and the Exchange Notes will constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. Exchange Notes shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee at one time or from time to time upon the receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order in principal amounts equal to the principal amounts of the Private Notes surrendered in exchange therefor. In addition, upon the receipt of such Company Order, the Trustee will take such actions as to effectuate the exchange of any Private Notes for Exchange Notes in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture.
So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Company will not, prior to June 15, 2009, optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds not subject to the release provisions of the Indenture.

This Note is a Global Note in respect of a duly authorized issue of 6.20% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES", which term includes any Global Notes representing such Notes) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof, issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $54,000,000.
Prior to the Release Date (as hereinafter defined), the Notes will be secured by first mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1933, from the Company to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (successor to Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "FIRST MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the First Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of first mortgage bonds, under the First Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional first mortgage bonds may be issued.
From and after such time as all first mortgage bonds (other than Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds and other first mortgage bonds securing a related series of Notes) issued under the First Mortgage have been retired through payment, redemption or otherwise at, before or after the maturity thereof (the "RELEASE DATE"), the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure the Notes in any manner. In certain circumstances prior to the Release Date as provided in the Indenture, the Company is permitted to reduce the aggregate principal amount of a series of Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds held by the Trustee, but in no event prior to the Release Date to an amount less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the series of Notes initially issued contemporaneously with such Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds.
So long as any Note of this Series is Outstanding, the Company will not, prior to June 15, 2009, optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds not subject to the release provisions of the Indenture.
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note of this Series issued upon transfer,
A-
5
exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
Interest on this Note will accrue from and including the Original Issue Date specified above to, but excluding, December 15, 2006, and thereafter, from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
Interest payments for this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). If the Maturity Date of this Note or any redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date or such redemption date.
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection
A-
6
and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes of this Series.
"COMPARABLE TREASURY PRICE" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER" means (A) Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER QUOTATIONS" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes of this Series (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes of this Series, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes of this Series, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes of this Series on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes of this Series.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal of and interest on the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture and, upon such declaration, the Trustee shall demand the redemption of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds to the extent provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifications of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer
A-
7
hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
As set forth in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such Notes, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes affected by such Event of Default shall have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and to provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, places and rates and the coin or currency prescribed in the Indenture.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note may be transferred only as permitted by the legend hereto and the provisions of the Indenture.
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee, directly or through an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized officer, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
All terms used in this Note that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated herein.

Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $54,000,000.

If the Maturity Date of this Note or any redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date or such redemption date.

The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.

The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes of this Series (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes of this Series, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes of this Series, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes of this Series on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes of this Series.

This Note is a Global Note in respect of a duly authorized issue of 6.70% Senior Secured Notes due 2036 (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES", which term includes any Global Notes representing such Notes) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof, issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $42,000,000.
Prior to the Release Date (as hereinafter defined), the Notes will be secured by first mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1933, from the Company to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (successor to Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "FIRST MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the First Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of first mortgage bonds, under the First Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional first mortgage bonds may be issued.
From and after such time as all first mortgage bonds (other than Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds and other first mortgage bonds securing a related series of Notes) issued under the First Mortgage have been retired through payment, redemption or otherwise at, before or after the maturity thereof (the "RELEASE DATE"), the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure the Notes in any manner. In certain circumstances prior to the Release Date as provided in the Indenture, the Company is permitted to reduce the aggregate principal amount of a series of Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds held by the Trustee, but in no event prior to the Release Date to an amount less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the series of Notes initially issued contemporaneously with such Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds.
So long as any Note of this Series is Outstanding, the Company will not, prior to June 15, 2009, optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds not subject to the release provisions of the Indenture.
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note of this Series issued upon transfer,

exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
Interest on this Note will accrue from and including the Original Issue Date specified above to, but excluding, December 15, 2006, and thereafter, from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
Interest payments for this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). If the Maturity Date of this Note or any redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date or such redemption date.
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time.

Exhibit 4.7
Company Order
June 14, 2006
The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. 911 Washington Avenue, Suite 300 St. Louis, Missouri 63101 Ladies and Gentlemen:
Application is hereby made to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), under the Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between Illinois Power Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), and the Trustee for the authentication and delivery of $75,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (the "Notes"), pursuant to the provisions of Article II of the Indenture. On or after the Release Date, the Company, in its discretion, may change the descriptive title of the Notes to delete the word "Secured" from such descriptive title. Additional Notes without limitation as to amount, and without the consent of the holders of the then Outstanding Notes, may also be authenticated and delivered in the manner provided in Section 2.05 of the Indenture. All capitalized terms not defined herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the same meaning as used in the Indenture.
The Notes will be initially issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in the form of Global Notes registered in the name of Cede & Co. (as nominee for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), New York, New York, which will act as the Depositary for the Global Notes). Pursuant to Section 2.05(c) of the Indenture, the Notes will have the terms set forth in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit A and in the form of definitive Note attached hereto as Exhibit B (which terms are incorporated by reference in this Company Order). The Global Notes shall bear the depository legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. The Notes will be issued only in denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Initially, beneficial interests in the Notes offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) ("QIBs") in reliance upon Rule 144A under the Securities Act will be represented by one or more separate Global Notes (each, a "Rule 144A Global Certificate") registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC and shall include the non-registration and registration rights legends set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. Initially beneficial interests in the Notes offered and sold to purchasers pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will be evidenced by one or more separate temporary Global Notes (each, a "Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate") and will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC for the accounts of The Euroclear System ("Euroclear") or Clearstream Banking, Luxembourg, socit anonyme ("Clearstream") and shall include the Regulation S and registration rights legends set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. Notes offered and sold to institutional "accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) who are not QIBs and who
are not purchasers pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will be in definitive form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and shall include the non-registration and registration rights legends set forth therein. The Trustee and the Company will have no responsibility or liability for any aspect of transfers of beneficial interests in the Notes (which transfers will be conducted pursuant to the customary procedures of DTC), any records of DTC of beneficial interests or any transactions between DTC and its participants or between any such participants and any other beneficial owners or for monitoring, supervising or reviewing of any thereof.
Transfers of beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificate will be subject to the restrictions on transfer contained in the non-registration legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Prior to the expiration of the period of 40 consecutive days beginning on and including the later of (x) the day on which the offering of the Notes commences and (y) the original issue date of the Notes (the "Distribution Compliance Period"), transfers of beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate will be subject to the restrictions on transfer contained in the Regulation S legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto. At any time after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, upon receipt by the Trustee and the Company of a certificate from Euroclear or Clearstream certifying that it has received certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership of a Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate (or portion thereof) with respect to any Notes to be exchanged, one or more separate permanent Global Notes (each, a "Permanent Regulation S Global Certificate" and, together with each Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate, each, a "Regulation S Global Certificate") shall be duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC, and shall include the registration rights legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto and shall be deposited with the Trustee, as custodian for DTC. The Trustee, as custodian for DTC, shall reflect by endorsement thereon a decrease in the principal amount of the Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate exchanged. Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in any Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers of beneficial interests in the Permanent Regulation S Global Certificate will not be subject to any restrictions.
In connection with any transfer of Notes, the Trustee and the Company shall be under no duty to inquire into, may conclusively presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in relying upon the certificates and other information (set forth in the form of definitive Note attached hereto as Exhibit B, for use in connection with the transfer of the Notes in definitive form, or set forth in Exhibit A-1 attached hereto, for use in connection with the transfer of beneficial interests between a Rule 144A Global Certificate and a Regulation S Global Certificate or to a Note in definitive form, or otherwise) received from the Holders and any transferees of any Notes regarding the validity, legality and due authorization of any such transfer, the eligibility of the transferee to receive such Note and any other facts and circumstances related to such transfer. Transfers of beneficial interests between a Rule 144A Global Certificate and a Regulation S Global Certificate, and other transfers relating to beneficial interests in the Notes in global form, shall be reflected by endorsements of the Trustee, as custodian for DTC, on the schedule attached to such certificate.

The Company has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of June 14, 2006 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the initial purchasers of the Notes pursuant to which the Notes that are issued and sold without registration (the "Private Notes") under the Securities Act may be exchanged for Notes that will be registered under the Securities Act and that will otherwise have substantially the same terms as the Private Notes (the "Exchange Notes"), except that such Exchange Notes will be issued in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit A and will bear all customary legends (except for the non-registration, Regulation S and registration rights legends) or, in lieu of such exchange, the Company has agreed to file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Notes (in which case any Notes so resold will be issued in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit A and bear all customary legends (except for the non-registration, Regulation S and registration rights legends)). The Private Notes will be exchanged for Exchange Notes only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and otherwise in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture. The Private Notes and the Exchange Notes will constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. Exchange Notes shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee at one time or from time to time upon the receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order in principal amounts equal to the principal amounts of the Private Notes surrendered in exchange therefor. In addition, upon the receipt of such Company Order, the Trustee will take such actions as to effectuate the exchange of any Private Notes for Exchange Notes in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture.

Payment of the principal of and interest and premium on this Note shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) of the Indenture.
This Note is a Global Note in respect of a duly authorized issue of 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES", which term includes any Global Notes representing such Notes) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof, issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $75,000,000.
Prior to the Release Date (as hereinafter defined), the Notes will be secured by mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the General  Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Company and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as successor trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of mortgage bonds, under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional mortgage bonds may be issued.
From and after such time as all mortgage bonds (other than Senior Note Mortgage Bonds and other mortgage bonds securing a related series of Notes) issued under the Mortgage have been retired through payment, redemption or otherwise at, before or after the maturity thereof (the "RELEASE DATE"), the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure the Notes in any manner. In certain circumstances prior to the Release Date as provided in the Indenture, the Company is permitted to reduce the aggregate principal amount of a series of Senior Note Mortgage Bonds held by the Trustee, but in no event prior to the Release Date to an amount less than the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the series of Notes initially issued contemporaneously with such Senior Note Mortgage Bonds.
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note of this Series issued upon transfer,
A-
4
exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
Interest on this Note will accrue from and including the Original Issue Date specified above to, but excluding, December 15, 2006, and thereafter, from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
Interest payments for this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). If the Maturity Date of this Note or any redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date or such redemption date.
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 20 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection
A-

Central Illinois Public Service Company, an Illinois corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Owner specified above, as trustee under the Senior Note Indenture hereinafter referred to, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount specified above on the Maturity Date specified above, and to pay to the Registered Owner interest on said sum from the Dated Date hereof, at the Interest Rate specified above, payable half-yearly on the Interest Payment Dates specified above, until said principal sum is paid. The interest so payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Supplemental Indenture dated June 1, 2006, hereinafter referred to, to the Registered Owner at the close of business of the Trustee hereinafter referred to on the immediately preceding Record Date. Both the principal of and the interest on this bond shall be payable in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Senior Note Trustee hereinafter referred to, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
Under an Indenture dated as of December 1, 1998 (the "Senior Note Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Senior Note Trustee"), the Company will issue, concurrently with the issuance of this bond, an issue of Notes under the Senior Note Indenture entitled "6.70% Senior Secured Notes due 2036" (the "Senior Secured Notes"). Pursuant to Article IV of the Senior Note Indenture, this bond is issued to the Senior Note Trustee to secure any and all obligations of the Company under the Senior Secured Notes and any other series of senior notes from time to time outstanding under the Senior Note Indenture. Payment of principal of, or premium, if any or interest on, the Senior Secured Notes shall constitute payments on this bond as further provided herein and in the Supplemental Indenture dated June 1, 2006 pursuant to which this bond has been issued (the "Supplemental Indenture").
Upon any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, all or any portion of the Senior Secured Notes, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or otherwise or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in accordance with Section 5.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, bonds of Senior Notes Series CC in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and having both a corresponding maturity date and interest rate shall, to the extent of such payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, be deemed paid and the obligation of the Company thereunder to make such payment shall be discharged to such extent and, in the case of the payment of principal (and premium, if any), such bonds shall be surrendered to the Company for cancellation as provided in Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture. The Trustee (as hereinafter defined) may at anytime and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing sentence unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Senior Note
Trustee signed by one of its officers stating (i) that timely payment of principal, or premium or interest on, the Senior Secured Notes has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Senior Note Trustee pursuant to the Senior Note Indenture, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
For purposes of Section 4.09 of the Senior Note Indenture, this bond shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds" in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.
This bond is one of the bonds issued and to be issued from time to time under and in accordance with and all secured by the indenture of mortgage or deed of trust dated October 1, 1941, executed and delivered by the Company to U.S. Bank National Association (formerly First Trust National Association, formerly First Trust of Illinois, National Association, successor trustee to Bank of America Illinois, formerly Continental Bank, formerly Continental Bank, National Association and formerly Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago and hereinafter referred to as the "Trustee") and Edmond B.

Crowley (successor Co-Trustee) being now the Trustees under the Indenture. Reference to the Indenture and to all supplemental indentures, if any, hereafter executed pursuant to the Indenture is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders and Registered Owners of said bonds and of the Trustees and of the Company in respect of such security. By the terms of the Indenture the bonds to be secured thereby are issuable in series, which may vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, redemption provisions, medium of payment and in other respects as in the Indenture provided.
This bond is not redeemable except on the respective dates, in the respective principal amounts and for the respective redemption prices that correspond to the redemption dates for, the principal amounts to be redeemed of, and the redemption prices for, the Senior Secured Notes, and except upon written demand of the Senior Note Trustee following the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Senior Note Indenture and the acceleration of the senior notes, as provided in Section 8.01 of the Senior Note Indenture.
In case of certain events of default specified in the Indenture, the principal of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor corporation, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment, penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers being waived and released by the
Registered Owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
This bond shall not be assignable or transferable except as permitted or required by Section 4.04 of the Senior Note Indenture.

As provided in Section 4.11 of the Senior Note Indenture, from and after the Release Date (as defined in the Senior Note Indenture), the obligations of the Company with respect to this bond shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged, this bond shall cease to secure in any manner any senior notes outstanding under the Senior Note Indenture, and, pursuant to Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture, the Senior Note Trustee shall forthwith deliver this bond to the Company for cancellation.
This bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose unless and until it shall have been authenticated by the execution by the Trustee or its successor in trust under the Indenture of the Trustee's Certificate endorsed hereon.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Central Illinois Public Service Company has caused this bond to be executed in its name by the manual or facsimile signature of its President or one of its Vice-Presidents, and its corporate seal or a facsimile thereof to be affixed or imprinted hereon and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.
 
 
This bond is one of the bonds of the series designated therein, described in the within mentioned Indenture.
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) duly paid by the Trustees to the Company, and of other good and valuable considerations, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and for the purpose of further assuring to the Trustees under the Indenture their title to, or lien upon, the property hereinafter described, under and pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, as hereby amended, and for the purpose of further securing the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest and the premium, if any, on all bonds which have been heretofore or shall be hereafter issued under the Indenture and indentures supplemental thereto and which shall be at any time outstanding thereunder and secured thereby and $61,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, and for the purpose of securing the faithful performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions set forth in the Indenture and/or in any indenture supplemental thereto, the Company has given, granted, bargained, sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, mortgaged, warranted the title to and conveyed, and by these presents does give, grant, bargain, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, mortgage, warrant the title to and convey unto U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION and PATRICK J.

SECTION 1. A series of bonds issuable under the Indenture, as hereby amended, to be known and designated as "First Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes Series CC" and which shall be executed, authenticated and issued only in the form of registered bonds without coupons, is hereby created and authorized. The bonds of Senior Notes Series CC and the Trustee's Certificate to be endorsed thereon shall be substantially in the form thereof hereinbefore recited. Each bond of Senior Notes Series CC is to be issued and registered in the name of The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, or a successor trustee (said trustee or any successor trustee being hereinafter referred to as the "Senior Note Trustee"), under the Indenture dated as of December 1, 1998 between the Company and the Senior Note Trustee (the "Senior Note Indenture"), to secure any and all obligations of the Company under the Senior Secured Notes and any other series of Notes from time to time outstanding under the Senior Note Indenture. Each bond of Senior Notes Series CC shall be dated as of the Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid next preceding the date of issue, unless (a) issued on an Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated as of such issue date, or (b) issued prior to the occurrence of the first Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated the Original Issue Date specified in the form of bond. The bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall be due and payable in the principal amount and on the Maturity Date specified below, shall bear interest from the date thereof at the Interest Rate per annum specified below payable half-yearly on the Interest Payment Dates specified in the form of bond to the Registered Owner as specified on the registry books of the Trustee at the close of business of the Trustee on the applicable Record Date as provided in Section 3 of this Article I.
 
 
The bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall be payable, as to both principal and interest, in immediately available funds, at the office or agency of the Senior Note Trustee, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
SECTION 2. Anything contained in Section 14 of Article I of the Indenture, or elsewhere in the Indenture, to the contrary notwithstanding, only the person in whose name any of the bonds of Senior Notes Series CC is registered (the "Registered Owner") at the close of business on any Record Date, as hereinafter defined, with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the cancellation of such bonds upon any transfer or exchange subsequent to the Record Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that if and to the extent the Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on such Interest Payment Date, such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names outstanding bonds of Senior Notes Series CC are registered on the Record Date to be established by the Trustee for payment of such defaulted interest.
Upon any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, all or any portion of the Senior Secured Notes, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or otherwise or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in accordance with Section 5.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, bonds of Senior Notes Series CC in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and having both a corresponding maturity date and interest rate shall, to the extent of such payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, be deemed paid and the obligation of the Company thereunder to make such payment shall be discharged to such extent and, in the case of the payment of principal (and premium, if any), such bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall be surrendered to the Company for cancellation as provided in Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture. The Trustee may at anytime and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing sentence unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Senior Note Trustee signed by one of its officers stating (i) the timely payment of principal, or premium or interest on, the Senior Secured Notes has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Senior Note Trustee pursuant to the Senior Note Indenture, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
SECTION 3. The term "Record Date" as used herein with respect to any Interest Payment Date (other than an Interest Payment Date for the payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the applicable Record Date specified in the form of bond next preceding such Interest Payment Date, or, if such Record Date shall be a legal holiday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of Chicago, Illinois, are authorized by law to close, then the next preceding day which shall not be a legal holiday or a day on which such institutions are so authorized to close.
SECTION 4. The bonds of Senior Notes Series CC are not redeemable except on the respective dates, in the respective principal amounts and for the respective redemption prices that
correspond to the redemption dates for, the principal amounts to be redeemed of, and the redemption prices for, the Senior Secured Notes, and except as set forth in Section 5 hereof.
In the event that the Company redeems any Senior Secured Notes prior to maturity in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Note Indenture, the Senior Note Trustee shall on the same date deliver to the Company the bonds of Senior Notes Series CC in principal amounts corresponding to the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, as provided in Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture. The Company agrees to give the Trustee notice of any such redemption of the Senior Notes on or before the date fixed for any such redemption.
SECTION 5. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Senior Note Indenture and the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, the bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee of a written demand (hereinafter called a "Redemption Demand") from the Senior Note Trustee stating that there has occurred under the Senior Note Indenture both an Event of Default and a declaration of acceleration of payment of principal, accrued interest and premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes specifying the last date to which interest on such Senior Secured Notes has been paid (such date being hereinafter referred to as the "Initial Interest Accrual Date") and demanding redemption of the bonds of Senior Notes Series CC. The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture. Upon surrender of the bonds of Senior Notes Series CC by the Senior Note Trustee to the Trustee, the bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon from the Initial Interest Accrual Date to the redemption date; provided, however, that in the event of a rescission or annulment of acceleration of Notes pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 8.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, then any Redemption Demand shall thereby deemed to be rescinded by the Senior Note Trustee although no such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 6. For purposes of Section 4.09 of the Senior Note Indenture, the bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of Senior Notes First Mortgage Bonds" in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.
SECTION 7. The bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall not be assignable or transferable except as permitted by Section 4.04 of the Senior Note Indenture. Any such transfer shall be effected at the principal office or place of business of the Trustee under the Indenture. The bonds of Senior Notes Series CC are exchangeable by the Registered Owner thereof, in person or by attorney duly authorized, at the principal office or place of business of the Trustee under the Indenture, upon the surrender and cancellation of said bonds and the payment of any stamp tax or other governmental charge, and upon any such exchange a new registered bond or bonds without coupons, of the same series and maturity and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be the same series and maturity and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued in exchange theretofore; and provided, that the Company shall not be required to exchange any bonds of Senior Notes Series CC for a period of ten (10) days next preceding an Interest Payment Date with respect to bonds of Senior Notes Series CC.
The bonds of Senior Notes Series CC shall, from time to time, be executed on behalf of the Company and sealed with the corporate seal of the Company, all in the manner provided or permitted by Section 6 of Article I of the Indenture, as follows:
(a)         bonds of Senior Notes Series CC executed on behalf of the Company by its President or a Vice-President and/or by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary may be so executed by the facsimile signature of such President or Vice-President and/or of such Secretary or Assistant Secretary, as the case may be, of the Company, or of any person or persons who shall have been such officer or officers, as the case may be, of the Company on or subsequent to the date of this supplemental indenture, notwithstanding that he or they may have ceased to be such officer or officers of the Company at the time of the actual execution, authentication, issue or delivery of any of such bonds, and any such facsimile signature or signatures of any such officer or officers on any such bonds shall constitute execution of such bonds on behalf of the Company by such officer or officers of the Company for the purposes of the Indenture, as hereby amended, and shall be valid and effective for all purposes, provided that all bonds shall always be executed on behalf of the Company by the signature, manual or facsimile, of its President or a Vice-President and of its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, and provided, further, that none of such bonds shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the same officer or person acting in more than one capacity; and

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Senior Note Indenture (as defined therein) and the acceleration of the Senior Notes, the bonds of the Thirty-First Series and the bonds of the Thirty-Second Series shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee of a written demand (hereinafter called a "") from the Senior Note Trustee stating that there has occurred under the Senior Note Indenture both an Event of Default and a declaration of acceleration of payment of principal, accrued interest and premium, if any, on the Senior Notes specifying the last date to which interest on such Senior Notes has been paid (such date being hereinafter referred to as the "") and demanding redemption of the bonds of the Thirty-First Series and the bonds of the Thirty-Second Series. The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture. Upon surrender of the bonds of the Thirty-First Series and the bonds of the Thirty-Second Series by the Senior Note Trustee to the Trustee, the bonds of the Thirty-First Series and the bonds of the Thirty-Second Series shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon from the Initial Interest Accrual Date to the redemption date; provided, however, that in the event of a rescission or annulment of acceleration of the Senior Notes pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 8.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, then any Redemption Demand shall thereby be deemed to be rescinded by the Senior Note Trustee although no such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

the bonds of the Thirty-Second Series 
For purposes of Section 4.09 of the Senior Note Indenture, the Bonds of the Thirty-First Series shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds" in respect of the Senior Notes Series 2016 and the Bonds of the Thirty-Second Series shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds" in respect of the Senior Notes Series 2036.

In the event that only a portion of a bond of the Thirty-First Series or a bond of the Thirty-Second Series is so surrendered, the Trustee shall deliver without charge to the Senior Note Trustee a new bond of the Thirty-First Series or of the Thirty-Second Series, as applicable, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the difference between the principal amount of the portion of the bond of the Thirty-First Series or the bond of the Thirty-Second Series so surrendered and the principal amount of such bond prior to such surrender.
The Company reserves the right, without any consent or other action by holders of the bonds of the Thirty-First Series or bonds of the Thirty-Second Series, or any subsequent series of bonds, to amend the Indenture by inserting the following language as Section 115A immediately following current Section 115 of the Indenture:
Section 3.              
SECTION 115A. With the consent of the holders of not less than sixty per centum (60%) in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if the rights of the holders of one or more, but not all, series then outstanding are affected, the consent of the holders of not less than sixty per centum (60%) in aggregate principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of all affected series, taken together, and not any other series, the Company, when authorized by a resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of any of the bonds and coupons; , that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium, payable on the redemption thereof or change the coin or currency in which any bond or interest thereon is payable, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any

lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding. For the purposes of this Section, bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture adversely affects or diminishes the rights of holders thereof against the Company or against its property.
Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 102 of the Indenture and Article Four of the Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 1, 1940, may rely upon, an opinion of counsel as conclusive evidence that any such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by the provisions of this Section.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such 60% or greater consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto. All subsequent holders of bonds bearing such notation shall be deemed to have consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and consent, once given or deemed to be given, may not be withdrawn.
14
Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or, any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture."
As supplemented and amended by this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Supplemental Indenture and all the terms and conditions herein contained shall be deemed a part thereof.
Section 4.              
Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, no duties, responsibilities or liabilities are assumed, or shall be construed to be assumed, by the Trustee by reason of this Supplemental Indenture, other than as set forth in the Indenture as heretofore amended and supplemented. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the recitals herein or in the bonds (other than in the authentication certificate of the Trustee), all of which are made by the Company solely.
Section 5.              
This Supplemental Indenture may be executed in several counterparts, and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
Section 6.              
Section 7.               The Company shall provide the Trustee with copies of the Senior Note Indenture and any amendments thereto as soon as practicable after such Indenture or amendment is entered into and the Trustee in performing its duties hereunder shall be entitled to rely on the latest copy of the Senior Note Indenture and any amendments thereto received from the Company.

This is one of the Mortgage Bonds of the series designated therein referred to in the within mentioned Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006.
[FORM OF REVERSE OF BOND]
This Mortgage Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Mortgage Bonds of the Company (the "Mortgage Bonds") in unlimited aggregate principal amount, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under and equally secured by the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 1, 1992, executed by the Company to BNY Midwest Trust Company, as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank (the "Trustee") to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the properties mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security, the rights of registered owners of the Mortgage Bonds and of the Trustee in respect thereof, and the terms and conditions upon which the Mortgage Bonds are, and are to be, secured. The Mortgage Bonds may be issued in series, for various principal sums, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture. This Mortgage Bond is one of a series designated as the Series AA Mortgage Bonds of the Company, unlimited in aggregate principal amount, issued under and secured by the Indenture and described in the Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (the "Supplemental Indenture of June 1, 2006" ), between the Company and the Trustee, supplemental to the Indenture.
This Series AA Mortgage Bond is subject to redemption in accordance with the terms of Article II of the Supplemental Indenture of June 1, 2006.
Series AA Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged, the Series AA Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure in any manner any Senior Notes outstanding under the Senior Note Indenture, and, pursuant to Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture, the Senior Note Trustee shall forthwith deliver the Series AA Mortgage Bonds to the Company for cancellation.
As provided in Section 4.11 of the Senior Note Indenture, from and after the Release Date (as defined in the Senior Note Indenture), the obligations of the Company with respect to the
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur, the principal of all Mortgage Bonds at any such time outstanding under the Indenture may be declared or may become due and payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that such declaration may be rescinded under certain circumstances.

Series AA Mortgage Bonds are not redeemable except on the date, in the principal amount and for the redemption price that correspond to the redemption date for, the principal amount to be redeemed of, and the redemption price for, the Senior Notes, and except as set forth in Section 2 of this Article II.
Section 1.           The
In the event that the Company redeems any Senior Notes prior to maturity in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Note Indenture, the Senior Note Trustee shall on the same date deliver to the Company the Series AA Mortgage Bonds in principal amount corresponding to the Senior Notes so redeemed, as provided in Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture. The Company agrees to give the Trustee notice of any such redemption of the Senior Notes on or before the date fixed for any such redemption.
Section 2.
          Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Senior Note Indenture (as defined therein) and the acceleration of the Senior Notes, the Series AA Mortgage Bonds shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of a written demand (hereinafter called a "Redemption Demand") from the Senior Note Trustee stating that there has occurred under the Senior Note Indenture both an Event of Default and a declaration of acceleration of payment of principal, accrued interest and premium, if any, on the Senior Notes specifying the last date to which interest on such Senior Notes has been paid (such date being hereinafter referred to as the "Initial Interest Accrual Date") and demanding redemption of the Series AA Mortgage Bonds. The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture. Upon surrender of the Series AA Mortgage Bonds by the Senior Note Trustee to the Trustee, the Series AA Mortgage Bonds shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon from the Initial Interest Accrual Date to the redemption date; provided, however, that in the event of a rescission or annulment of acceleration of the Senior Notes pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 8.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, then any Redemption Demand shall thereby be deemed to be rescinded by the Senior Note Trustee although no such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
The Company hereby exercises the right to obtain the authentication of $75,000,000 principal amount of additional Bonds pursuant to the terms of Section 4.04 of the Indenture, all of which shall be Series AA Mortgage Bonds. Except as provided below in connection with the Release Date (as defined in the Senior Note Indenture), the principal amount of the Series AA Mortgage Bonds outstanding from time to time shall always be equal to the principal amount of the Senior Notes which are outstanding from time to time under the Senior Note Indenture and to the extent the Senior Note Trustee holds Series AA Mortgage Bonds in excess of such principal amount, such Series AA Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed cancelled and retired and no longer outstanding under the Indenture.
Section 1.              
Such Series AA Mortgage Bonds may be authenticated and delivered prior to the filing for recordation of this Supplemental Indenture.
