ITEM 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
Reference is made to Note 2 - Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 7 - Related Party Transactions to the financial statements under Part I, Item 1, Outlook under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2006, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE (UE), Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco), CILCORP Inc., Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO ("CILCO") and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP) (collectively, the registrants), for a discussion of the joint dispatch agreement among UE, CIPS and Genco and the Illinois power procurement auction. Reference is also made to Note 14 - Related Party Transactions to the financial statements under Part II, Item 8 in the registrants Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, for a discussion of the joint dispatch agreement. The joint dispatch agreement as last amended and restated effective January 10, 2006 (filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K of Ameren, UE, CIPS and Genco dated January 9, 2006) (JDA), under which UE and Genco jointly dispatch electric generation, provides each affiliate the option to serve its load requirements from its own generation first and then to allow access to any available remaining generation to its affiliate at incremental cost. Any excess generation not used by UE or Genco to serve load requirements is sold to third parties on a short-term basis. Under the provisions of the JDA, the margins from third party sales are allocated between UE and Genco based on generation output. CIPS is no longer an active participant under the JDA due to the transfer of its power plants to Genco in 2000. The JDA established no specific termination date for the agreement but provided any party the right to terminate it on one years notice. The JDA may be terminated earlier by mutual consent of the parties.
On July 7, 2006, UE, CIPS and Genco mutually consented to waive the one year termination notice requirement and agreed to terminate the JDA on December 31, 2006. This action with respect to the JDA will require acceptance by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
The benefits of the JDA to UE and Genco have changed recently due to the emergence of transparent wholesale markets, the dispatching of generation being conducted by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO), and changes to the Illinois regulatory framework, among other things. As a result, UE believes the benefit it will receive from retaining the power it was transferring under the JDA to Genco at incremental cost will exceed the benefit it would have received from being able to call upon Gencos generation under the JDA at
-2-
incremental cost. Since UE was prepared to immediately provide Genco with one year notice of termination, Genco believes the potential benefit it could receive from being able to call upon UEs generation through June 2007 is outweighed by, among other things, the negative consequences associated with the continued existence of the JDA past December 31, 2006. In particular, Genco believes that the JDA is no longer necessary or effective in dispatching Gencos generation jointly with that of UE due to changes in the marketplace for the sale of electricity, including the MISO Day Two Energy Market, and the centralized dispatching of generation by MISO.  Additionally, the JDA is based on a combined control area for the UE and CIPS transmission facilities located in Missouri and Illinois, respectively.  This combined control area creates operational inefficiencies for Genco to effectively participate through Ameren Energy Marketing Company (Marketing Company) in the Illinois power procurement auction for power beginning January 1, 2007.  In conjunction with terminating the JDA, Amerens transmission-owning entities intend to restructure their control areas so as to have one control area in Missouri for UEs transmission facilities and one in Illinois for the transmission facilities of CIPS, CILCO and IP.
As a result of the termination of the JDA on December 31, 2006, UE and Genco will no longer have the obligation to provide power to each other. In 2005, Genco received from UE under the JDA net transfers of 8.7 million megawatthours of power at an average price of $18 per megawatthour and generated 14.2 million megawatthours of power from its plants at an average cost of approximately $18 per megawatthour. This power, along with 1.2 million megawatthours purchased from Electric Energy, Inc. (EEI), which is 40% owned by UE and 40% owned by Ameren Energy Development Company, was used in 2005 to supply CIPS load and other wholesale and retail customers at an average selling price of $35 per megawatthour. In 2005, Genco also sold 3.3 million net megawatthours of power in the interchange market at $47 per megawatthour. Upon termination of the JDA, Genco will no longer receive the margins on sales that were supplied with power from UE. However, Genco will still have access to its own generation and expects to be able to sell this power at higher average prices than this power was sold for in 2005 because of the expiration of its power supply contract with CIPS and the expiration of contracts to supply other wholesale and retail customers on or before December 31, 2006. Genco currently expects to generate approximately 17.5 million megawatthours of power in 2007. By 2007, only 5.2 million megawatthours of power covered by wholesale and retail electric power supply agreements that were in effect in 2005 will remain outstanding. These agreements have an average embedded selling price of $36 per megawatthour. All other power supply agreements in effect in 2005 will expire by the end of 2006 and any available generation will be sold at prevailing market prices. Genco and AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company (AERG) (a subsidiary of CILCO) through their affiliate Marketing Company and UE will have the opportunity to participate in the Illinois power procurement auction for 2007. However, they would be subject to a limitation of 35% of CIPS, CILCOs and IPs annual load, or about 13 million megawatthours, which is an auction restriction imposed on any single supplier providing power to CIPS, CILCO and IP through the auction. Ameren affiliated companies will be considered one supplier for purposes of this limitation.
Amerens earnings will be affected by the termination of the JDA when UEs rates are adjusted by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC). As noted in the press release (Exhibit 99.1 hereto) incorporated by reference under Item 8.01 below, UE announced on July 7, 2006, that it had filed a request with the MoPSC to increase its electric rates by $361 million. UEs requested increase is net of the decrease in its revenue requirement resulting from increased margins expected to result from the termination of the JDA. UEs proposed rate increase is subject to review and approval by the MoPSC.
 In 2007, Amerens earnings are also expected to be impacted by the expiration on December 31, 2006, of the contract for AERG to supply CILCO with power. AERG currently expects to generate approximately 7 million megawatthours of power in 2007 compared to 5.9 million megawatthours of power that was generated in 2005 at an average cost of approximately $15 per megawatthour. In 2005, this power was sold principally to CILCO at an average price of $32 per megawatthour. In addition, AERG sold 1 million net megawatthours of power in the interchange market at $38 per megawatthour in 2005. In 2007, all of AERGs power will be sold at prevailing market prices. On December 31, 2005, a power supply agreement with EEI for UE, CIPS (whose entitlement was resold to Marketing Company) and IP expired. Power supplied under the agreement by EEI to UE, Marketing Company and IP was priced at EEIs cost-based rates. Power previously supplied under this agreement to UE, Marketing Company and IP is being sold at market prices in 2006, which are above EEIs cost-based rates and will continue to be sold at market prices in 2007. However, in 2006, UE, Genco (which supplies Marketing Company) and IP are replacing power previously received from EEI either through the use of their own higher-cost generation or higher-cost power purchases. In 2005, EEI generated 7.9 million megawatthours of power. UE, CIPS (which
 
-3-
resold the power to Marketing Company) and IP purchased 3.0 million, 2.0 million and 1.2 million megawatthours, respectively, from EEI at an average price of $20 per megawatthour. The remaining generation was sold to EEIs minority owner. The expiration of this agreement and the resulting decrease in UEs margins and increase in its revenue requirement was also reflected in UEs July 7, 2006, request to the MoPSC to increase electric rates discussed above.
The ultimate impact of all of the matters mentioned above on the registrants results of operation, financial position, or liquidity cannot be predicted at this time.

For Immediate Release
 
St. Louis, MO, July 7, 2006 -- AmerenUE, an operating company of Ameren Corporation (NYSE:AEE), today filed a request for an increase in base rates for electric service with the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC). If approved, it would mark the first electric rate increase for AmerenUE in almost 20 years.
Overview of Electric Rate Filing
 
The companys filing includes a proposed average increase in electric rates of 17.7 percent or $361 million. The company is also proposing to limit the increase on residential rates to 10 percent, allocating revenue amounts above that level to other customer classes
.
Under the application, a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month would see the electric bill rise from approximately $66 per month to $72 per month, excluding taxes. Even with this increase, a typical AmerenUE residential electric customer would be paying rates that would be below AmerenUEs 1991 levels.
 
In addition to the proposed limit on the residential rate increase, the company has committed to working with key stakeholders during the rate review process to develop low income energy assistance and energy conservation programs to help address customers needs.
Page Two
For decades, our focus on our core energy business, cost control and operating efficiencies has resulted in our customers enjoying some of the lowest electric rates in the nation, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Ameren Corporation. Our customers have come to expect AmerenUE to deliver a highly reliable, environmentally friendly supply of electricity at reasonable prices. We are committed to continuing to meet their expectationsnow and in the future.
 
He added, We recognize that our customers are experiencing meaningful increases in many of their monthly costs, consistent with trends we are seeing across the nation. Because we are concerned about how these increases will impact each familys budget, our proposal seeks to develop a program to assist our most vulnerable customers who need help paying their electric bills.
 
He stressed that the company will continue to give to, and encourage others to contribute to, its Dollar More program, the regions largest private energy assistance fund for customers in need. AmerenUE will also encourage customers to participate in Budget Billing, a company program that levels monthly bill amounts.
 
Through this filing, AmerenUE is proposing to develop at least 100 megawatts of wind power that will benefit all AmerenUE customers and to launch a voluntary program allowing customers to support additional development of wind power and other forms of renewable energy.
 
AmerenUEs filing also includes proposed economic development incentive rates for nonresidential customers who move operations into targeted urban areas where the City of St. Louis is trying to spur re-development. Eligible projects would provide social and economic benefits in areas where jobs are needed and re-development is critical to area improvement.
 
Finally, Rainwater added that consistent with the companys commitment to accept full responsibility for the effects of the Dec. 14 failure of its Taum Sauk Plant, AmerenUE has not included in the rate request filed today the related costs that the company has incurred. Those costs include the clean-up of Johnsons Shut-Ins state park, reimbursement of state costs and resolution of individual claims.
 
The companys proposal is subject to the customary rate review process, which includes review and approval by the MoPSC. A decision is expected no later than June 2007.

Perspectives on Electric Rate Increase Proposal
 
AmerenUEs electric rates are among the lowest in the nation
.
Since 1987 (the last time the companys base rates were increased), the company has lowered its electric rates by approximately 13 percent. In 2005, AmerenUEs average electric rates were approximately 30 percent below the national average and 15 percent below the Midwest average and the lowest of the investor-owned utilities in the state. In addition, St. Louis has the second lowest residential electric rates in the country compared to the rates of the major metropolitan areas surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
 
 
However, while electric rates remained low, many electric bills have grown as a result of higher electricity usage. The average electricity usage by residential customers has risen 30 percent since the late 1980s as residents have added computers, second refrigerators, home entertainment systems, multiple television sets, cell phone chargers and other electrical devices to their homes.
 
Since the companys last rate case (2002), AmerenUEs average residential electric rates have decreased 6 percent, while electric rates across the United States and Midwest rose 11 percent and 5 percent, respectively, through the end of 2005. From 2002 through 2005, regional prices for consumer products rose 10 percent, medical costs increased by 15 percent and housing costs rose 23 percent, according to BLS.
 
The trend in rising electric rates is continuing: Recent U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) data reflects that U.S. average electric rates in the first quarter of 2006 are already 12 percent above where they were a year ago. In addition, should the companys proposal be approved by the MoPSC in 2007, AmerenUE average electric rates will still be more than 20 percent below the U.S. average electric rates projected by the U.S. DOE.
 
In addition to keeping rates low, AmerenUE remains committed to providing superior customer serviceranking among the top utility companies in customer satisfaction surveys. The company has invested in state-of-the-art technology to meet its customers needs. In fact, the respected global marketing information firm known for surveys of customer satisfaction, J.D. Power and Associates, recently ranked AmerenUE better than its industry peers in the Midwest in number of brief power outages, the number of lengthy outages and the average length of the longest outages.

Service Experience. AmerenUE is among a select few electric or gas utility companies in the nation to receive this certification.
Factors Contributing to Need for Electric Rate Increase
 
Under Missouri regulation, AmerenUE is permitted to recover from its customers its prudently incurred investments, including an appropriate return on those investments, as well as its prudently incurred costs of operating its electric operations. Since its 2002 electric rate case, AmerenUE has made significant investments in critical energy infrastructure, as well as incurred significantly higher operating expenses. For example:
 
 
Page Five
Looking ahead, AmerenUE expects many of these costs to continue to rise. In addition, AmerenUE intends to continue to make significant investments in its energy infrastructure, including investments in renewable generation, environmental upgrades and reliability enhancements. Without appropriate rate relief, among other things, AmerenUE would have difficulty making critical energy infrastructure investments in a timely fashion, inhibiting the companys ability to provide reliable service on a continuous basis and increasing its borrowing costs.
 
In our proposal, we are seeking recovery of investments we have made in our business since the last rate case, an appropriate return on those investments, as well as recovery of the costs of operating our business, said Rainwater. The ability to make timely investments in energy infrastructure is critical to meeting existing and future customer demands, which ultimately drives the economy of the state. For AmerenUE to continue to meet growing customer demand in a prudent and reliable fashion, to meet environmental standards that will require AmerenUE to invest $1.2 to $1.6 billion in environmental controls over the next 10 years, invest in environmentally friendly renewable generation and to begin preparation for its next baseload plant addition, it is essential that we receive a constructive regulatory decision that permits us to recover the investments and costs we are incurring.

For Immediate Release
ST. LOUIS, MO., July 7, 2006Citing major investments in the infrastructure of its natural gas business and rising operating expenses, AmerenUE, an operating company of Ameren Corporation (NYSE:AEE), today filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) for an $11 million increase in natural gas delivery rates for its approximately 125,000 Missouri gas customers. Since delivery rates account for only a portion of customers total natural gas billsabout one-third for residential customersAmerenUEs proposed increase of 18.3 percent in delivery rates would result in an increase in total gas revenues of about 6.4 percent.
 
For a typical residential customer, AmerenUEs request would mean an average increase of about $6 per month, excluding taxes. But the request will not have any immediate effect on customers gas bills, since it must first go through the process of MoPSC review and hearings. A decision is expected no later than June 2007.
 
In its rate filing, AmerenUE is seeking to recover expenses associated with more than $40 million of investments in gas system improvements and expansions designed to improve service reliability and keep pace with growing customer needs. Improvements include significant replacement of old cast iron mains and unprotected steel service lines that have been completed since AmerenUEs last gas rate case in 2003.
Add One
Since July 1, 2003, AmerenUE has replaced about 70 miles of old cast iron and unprotected steel gas mains and more than 3,300 service lines with modern polyethylene pipe, largely to comply with state regulations, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Ameren Corporation.
 
In addition, we have added about 215 miles of new gas mains and more than 10,000 service connections to accommodate new growth. AmerenUE customers are receiving the benefits of these expenditures, but current rates do not reflect these higher costs, Rainwater said.
 
Gas delivery rates reflect the cost of constructing, operating and maintaining AmerenUEs natural gas system, but not the cost of natural gas itself. The delivery costs usually account for about a third of a typical residential customers total gas bill, excluding taxes. The remainder consists of the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA), which reflects the commodity cost of natural gas from the companys suppliers.
 
AmerenUEs delivery charges are regulated, and any changes must be approved by the MoPSC through a rate case. Supplier costs for natural gas are not regulated, and go up or down based on supply and demand. These supplier costs are passed on to customers through the PGA without markup by AmerenUE. The MoPSC reviews PGA costs for prudence and accuracy, but changes do not require the filing of a formal rate case.
 
In its rate filing, the company is also seeking to equalize the way the PGA is calculated for all its customers. Presently, the PGA differs among the four different geographic regions of Missouri where AmerenUE provides gas service, due to differences in pipeline suppliers in these areas.
 
This change is designed to benefit all of our customers by creating a common PGA rate applicable to all AmerenUE gas customers. The purpose is to more effectively integrate our centralized gas purchasing and price-hedging strategies that are designed to reduce price volatility in the cost of gas from our suppliers, Rainwater said.
