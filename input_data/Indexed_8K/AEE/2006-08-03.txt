FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Aug. 3, 2006Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second quarter 2006 net income of $123 million, or 60 cents per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $
185 milli
on, or 93 cents per basic and diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005. Net income for the first six months of 2006 was $193 million, or 94 cents per share, compared to $306 million, or $1.55 per share, in the first half of 2005.
 
Several factors contributed to Amerens decreased earnings in the second quarter as compared to last year, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Ameren Corporation. These included higher fuel and related transportation costs, decreased power plant availability, including an unplanned outage at our Callaway nuclear plant, costs associated with the Taum Sauk incident and milder weather.
 
Revenues in the second quarter of 2006 of $1.6 billion were comparable to the prior-year period. Cooling degree days in the second quarter of 2006 were 20 percent above normal, but approximately 8 percent below the second quarter of 2005, according to the National Weather Service. As a result, weather-sensitive residential electric sales in the second quarter of 2006 fell almost 4 percent, and commercial electric sales decreased 1 percent below the prior-year period. The effect of weather is estimated to have reduced second quarter 2006 earnings by 4 cents per share versus the same period in 2005.
 
 
Industrial electric sales in the second quarter of 2006 increased 9 percent as a result of sales to Noranda Aluminum, Inc, which became a customer on June 1, 2005. Interchange power sales decreased 7 percent in the second quarter of 2006 versus the same period a year ago, due primarily to decreased power plant availability and higher industrial electric sales.
 
Fuel and purchased power costs increased $39 million in the second quarter of 2006 over the same period in 2005, primarily because of significantly higher coal and related transportation costs,

as well as higher purchased power costs as a result of plant outages and the expiration of a cost-based affiliate power supply contract at the end of 2005. In addition, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19 million in the second quarter of 2006 as compared to the second quarter of 2005. Other operations and maintenance expenses increased principally because of $10 million of incremental costs associated with the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at AmerenUEs Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility and higher legal fees.
 
On July 19, and again on July 21, our service territory was hit by severe storms, which included several tornados, added Rainwater. These storms were the most damaging in the companys history and resulted in the loss of power to approximately 700,000 of our customers. Through the dedication of a force of 5,200, including our employees, contractors and utility workers from 13 states, we restored service to all of our customers within nine days. While the full financial impact of these storms has not yet been determined, we have incurred unanticipated costs and the loss of electric margins as a result of these devastating storms.
 
The first half of 2006 was indeed challenging as several unexpected events transpired that negatively impacted earnings, including continuing costs from the Taum Sauk incident, milder winter weather, severe spring storms, unscheduled plant outages and weaker-than-expected power prices, added Rainwater. As we look ahead to the second half of 2006, we expect, among other things, to realize the benefits from the lack of a Callaway refueling outage, fewer outages and the lack of coal conservation measures at our coal-fueled power plants, and lower Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. charges as compared to the second half of 2005. Looking forward to 2007, we are hopeful many of the events that negatively impacted earnings in 2006 will be behind us. We will also be working hard to get appropriate recovery of our higher operating costs and infrastructure investments in our pending rate cases in Missouri and Illinois. And finally, we will remain focused on optimizing the value of our low-cost unregulated generation in Illinois as below-market power supply agreements will expire at the end of 2006.
 
Ameren also announced today that it is reducing its 2006 non-GAAP earnings guidance. The company now expects non-GAAP 2006 earnings to range between $2.75 and $3.00 per share, which excludes any impact of the July 2006 storms. Earnings per share guidance was reduced primarily because of reduced power plant availability in the second quarter of 2006, the incremental costs of the Taum Sauk incident, warmer-than-normal winter weather and lower-than-expected power prices for interchange sales. Amerens guidance assumes normal weather for the
 
 
Add Two
 
rest of 2006, excludes any impact of the July 2006 storms, and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.
 
Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Thursday, Aug. 3, to discuss second quarter 2006 earnings and other matters related to the company. Investors, the news media and the public may listen to a live Internet broadcast of the call at www.ameren.com by clicking on "Q2 2006 Ameren Corporation Earnings Conference Call," then the appropriate audio link. A slide presentation will also be available on Amerens Web site that reconciles second quarter and first half 2006 earnings per share to second quarter and first half 2005 earnings per share and the 2006 earnings per share guidance to 2005 earnings per share on a comparable share basis. This presentation will be posted in the Investors section of the Web site under Presentations. The analyst call will also be available for replay on the Internet for one year. Telephone playback of the conference call will also be available beginning at 11:00 a.m. (Central Time), from Aug. 3 through Aug. 10, by dialing, U.S. (800) 405-2236; international (303) 590-3000 and entering the number: 11065832#.
 
With assets of more than $18 billion, Ameren serves approximately 2.4 million electric customers and almost one million natural gas customers in a 64,000 square mile area of Missouri and Illinois. Ameren owns a diverse mix of electric generating plants strategically located in its Midwest market with a generating capacity of more than 16,200 megawatts.
 
Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this presentation on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. Ameren believes this information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on Amerens earnings per share. 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes any impact of the July 2006 storms, which has not yet been determined
