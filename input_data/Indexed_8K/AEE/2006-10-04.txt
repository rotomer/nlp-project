Risk Factors in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Ameren Energy Generating Company, CILCORP Inc., Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP) (collectively, the registrants), for a discussion of the process for power procurement for Amerens Illinois utility companies after the expiration of the current Illinois electric rate freeze on January 1, 2007 and power supply contracts on December 31, 2006 and a discussion of the delivery service rate cases filed by Amerens Illinois utility companies with the Illinois Commerce Commission in December 2005. Reference is also made to the Form 8-K filed by Ameren and certain of its registrant subsidiaries on September 18, 2006.
On October 2, 2006, Michael J. Madigan, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives sent a letter (the Speakers letter) to Illinois Governor Rod R. Blagojevich asking the Illinois Governor to call a special session of the Illinois General Assembly for the purpose of considering legislation which would extend the electric rate freeze applicable to electric utility companies in Illinois, including CIPS, CILCO and IP, until January 1, 2010. A copy of the Speakers letter is included as Exhibit 99.1. On October 2, 2006, the Illinois Governor sent a letter (the Governors letter) in response to the Speakers letter indicating that once he and the Speaker had the votes to pass the legislation he would immediately call for a special session of the legislature. The Governors letter further provided that in the event he is unable to reach a consensus with members of the General Assembly in the near future, he would call a special session in that event as well. The Governors letter stated he continued to support legislation extending a rate freeze and would like to sign it into law as soon as possible. A copy of the Governors letter is included as Exhibit 99.2.
We are unable to predict whether any efforts to extend the electric rate freeze will be successful.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Honorable Rod Blagojevich
207 State House
Springfield, IL 62706
Dear Governor Blagojevich:
 
Two weeks ago the Illinois Commerce Commission announced the results of the states first power auction and it was terrible news for residential and small business electric consumers. Next year, those living in the ComEd service territory can expect rate hikes of at least 26%, those in the area served by Ameren face 45% increases and residents of the CILCO service area will see their bills jump 55%.
 
Ten years ago, Illinois electric rates were among the highest in the nation. In exchange for moving towards a deregulated electric market, utility companies consented to have rates rolled back by 20% and frozen. Legislators, consumer advocates, businesses and utility companies who supported the 1997 deregulation law had high hopes that a process had been set in motion which would lead the state towards a robust electric market that would use competition to set fair power prices.
 
It is now evident that, contrary to expectations in 1997, true competition has yet to develop in the Illinois power market and the outcome of the September power auction was not the intended result of the deregulation legislation. The auction, therefore, has become little more than a sham procedure for tremendously profitable utility companies to potentially turn already record earnings and profits into exorbitant gains for their executives and shareholders - at the expense of working families, senior citizens and those on fixed incomes.
 
In light of these facts, I write to ask that you take the extraordinary step of calling a special session of the Illinois General Assembly, to convene within the next seven days, for the purpose of considering legislation identical in content to House Bill 5766. This legislation would keep the current rate freeze in effect until 2010, giving more time for real competition to develop or for lawmakers to find a different way of ensuring that the state has a reliable power supply and fair pricing for consumers. It has the support of the Citizens Utility Board, AARP, Illinois Public Interest Research Group, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, IBEW Locals 15, 51 and 702, SEIU, Lt. Governor Pat Quinn and Attorney General Lisa Madigan.
 
I believe that time is of the essence and that we cannot afford to wait until the November veto session to consider this matter. With the new prices set to take effect on January 1, 2007, we must act quickly to ensure that all affected parties, including utility companies, businesses and, most importantly, residential customers, know who will supply the states electricity and at what prices.
 
 
It is my hope that you will give this request your prompt attention and due consideration. I believe it is imperative that we work together to pass meaningful legislation and prevent Illinois citizens from being victimized by unfair electric rate increases.
 
With kindest personal regards, I remain
 
 Sincerely yours,
   
 /s/ Michael J. Madigan
   
 Michael J. Madigan
   
C: Senate President Jones
 

 
Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Rod R. Blagojevich
    Governor
 
 
 
Honorable Leaders of the General Assembly:
 
As you are well aware, the Illinois Commerce Commission recently announced the results of the States first power auction, the outcome of which will translate into extraordinary rate hikes for the hardworking consumers of this State. Today, I received a letter from Speaker Madigan asking for a special session to consider legislation extending the freeze on electric utility rates set to expire on December 31, 2006.
 
I have and continue to support legislation extending a rate freeze and would like to sign it into law as soon as possible. To this end, I intend to work with you right away to secure sufficient support among lawmakers to pass such legislation. Once we have the votes to pass the legislation, I will immediately call a special session to do so. I have every confidence that members of the legislature will agree that it is necessary to extend the rate freeze and protect consumers from significant electricity rate increases, but if we are unable to reach consensus in the near future, I will call a special session to take up the matter. Such a session will continue for as long as necessary to reach the intended result, even if it is extended through the holiday season.
 
I look forward to working with each of you in the near future to secure the support of your members so we can prevent the utility companies from expanding on their already near record profits at the expense of the hardworking families in this State.
 
 Sincerely,
   
 /s/ Rod R. Blagojevich
   
 Governor Rod R. Blagojevich
