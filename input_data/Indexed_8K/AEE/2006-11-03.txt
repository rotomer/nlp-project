ITEM 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
Reference is made to Note 14 - Related Party Transactions under Part II, Item 8 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and Note 7 - Related Party Transactions under Part I, Item 1 in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), and Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco) (collectively, the registrants), for a discussion of the electric power supply agreement (the Genco-Marketing Company PSA) between Genco and Ameren Energy Marketing Company (Marketing Company), an indirect subsidiary of Ameren and an affiliate of CIPS and Genco. Reference is also made to Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in the registrants Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and Note 2 - Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part I, Item 1, Outlook under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Risk Factors under Part II, Item 1A in the registrants Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006, for a discussion of power procurement after the current Illinois electric utility rate freeze expires on January 1, 2007 and power supply agreements expire on December 31, 2006. The Genco-Marketing Company PSA as last amended and restated on March 30, 2001 (filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Amerens Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2001) provides for the sale by Genco to Marketing Company of all of the energy and capacity available from Gencos electric generating facilities. The Genco-Marketing Company PSA is used in substantial part to allow Marketing Company to obtain the energy and capacity it is obliged to provide to CIPS under a separate power supply agreement (the Marketing Company-CIPS PSA) between Marketing Company and CIPS (filed as Exhibit 10.2 to Amerens Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2001). CIPS in turn uses this energy and capacity to serve its retail customer load and for other purposes. The Marketing Company-CIPS PSA will expire under its express terms on December 31, 2006.
The Genco-Marketing Company PSA established no specific termination date for the agreement but provided either party the right to terminate it on one years notice. The Genco-Marketing Company PSA may be terminated earlier by mutual consent of the parties.
With the December 31, 2006 expiration of the Marketing Company-CIPS PSA that is supported by energy and capacity supplied under the Genco-Marketing Company PSA, Genco and Marketing Company on October 31, 2006, mutually consented to waive the one year termination notice requirement of the Genco-Marketing Company PSA and agreed to terminate it on December 31, 2006. This action will require acceptance by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Nov. 3, 2006Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced third quarter 2006 net income of $293 million, or $1.42 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $280
milli
on, or $1.37 per basic and diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005. Net income for the first nine months of 2006 was $486 million, or $2.37 per share, compared to $586 million, or $2.94 per share, in the first nine months of 2005. Net income in 2006 reflects costs and lost electric margins resulting from severe 2006 storms totaling approximately $31 million, or 10 cents per share, for the third quarter and approximately $40 million, or 13 cents per share, for the first nine months of 2006. The July 2006 storms resulted in the loss of power to approximately 950,000 of Amerens electric customers.
 
The most damaging storms in the companys history, costs associated with the Taum Sauk incident and milder summer weather provided significant earnings challenges in the third quarter of 2006, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. Nonetheless, electric margins still rose during the quarter due to solid organic growth, industrial customers switching back to the Illinois utilities, improved plant operations, higher interchange margins and lower costs associated with the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) Day Two energy market. These factors, coupled with other cost control initiatives, more than offset the impact of these earnings challenges and contributed to solid third quarter financial results.
 
Revenues in the third quarter of 2006 of $1.9 billion were up slightly compared to the prior-year period. Cooling degree days in the third quarter of 2006 in Amerens service territory were 13 percent above normal, but 10 percent below the prior-year period, according to the National Weather Service. As a result, weather-sensitive residential electric sales in the third quarter of 2006 were 7 percent below the same period in 2005. Combined commercial and industrial electric sales in the third quarter of 2006 were flat compared to the prior-year period. The lower electric

sales resulting from the milder weather are estimated to have reduced third quarter 2006 earnings by 3 cents per share compared to the prior-year period.
 
During the third quarter of 2006, total electric sales and related margins improved due to solid organic growth, as well as due to several large industrial customers switching back to Illinois tariff rates because of the expiration of power contracts with suppliers. In addition, interchange revenues and related margins rose during the quarter from 80-percent-owned Electric Energy, Inc. because of the expiration of cost-based power supply contracts at the end of 2005, increased generating plant capacity factors and reduced native load electric sales resulting from the milder summer weather. Lower energy prices in the third quarter of 2006 offset, in part, these positive factors, as on-peak market prices for power declined approximately 40 percent. Energy prices were higher in 2005 as a result of the significant impact of hurricanes and rail disruptions.
 
Fuel and purchased power costs decreased $11 million in the third quarter of 2006 from the same period in 2005. This was due to improved power plant operations, lower costs of operating in the MISO Day Two energy market and reduced emission allowance costs in the companys non-rate-regulated generation businesses. These factors more than offset higher coal and related transportation costs in the third quarter of 2006, as compared to the same period in 2005.
 
In the third quarter of 2005, a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage began at AmerenUEs Callaway nuclear plant. The lack of a similar outage in the current-year quarter also led to lower fuel and purchased power costs and decreased other operations and maintenance expenses.
 
Costs associated with the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at AmerenUEs Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric facility, including a third quarter 2006 settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, reduced third quarter 2006 net income by approximately $17 million, or 7 cents per share, compared to the year-ago period.
 
Amerens Missouri regulated operations segment, which includes AmerenUEs regulated operations, contributed $258 million to Amerens net income for the first nine months of 2006, or $88 million less than the year-ago period. The Illinois regulated operations segment, which includes the electric and gas distribution businesses of AmerenCIPS, AmerenCILCO and AmerenIP, contributed $125 million to Amerens net income for the first nine months of 2006, or $34 million less than the year-ago period. The non-rate-regulated electric generation segment contributed $100 million to Amerens net income for the first nine months of 2006, or $11 million more than the year-ago period. Corporate and other non-rate-regulated activities increased net
 
 
 
 
 
Add Two
 
income in the first nine months of 2006 by $3 million as compared to an $8 million reduction of net income in the year-ago period.
 
Ameren also announced today that it is reaffirming its 2006 non-GAAP earnings guidance, which excludes the nine-month impact of the severe 2006 storms. The company expects non-GAAP 2006 earnings to range between $2.75 and $3.00 per share. The impact of the severe 2006 storms is estimated to be 13 to 15 cents per share. Amerens guidance assumes normal weather for the rest of 2006, excludes any impact of the severe 2006 storms, and is subject to, among other things, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, regulatory and legislative decisions, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.
 
Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Friday, Nov. 3, to discuss third quarter 2006 earnings and other matters related to the company. Investors, the news media and the public may listen to a live Internet broadcast of the call at www.ameren.com by clicking on "Q3 2006 Ameren Corporation Earnings Conference Call," then the appropriate audio link. A slide presentation will also be available on Amerens Web site that reconciles earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 to the same periods in 2005. It also reconciles the 2006 earnings per share guidance to 2005 earnings per share on a comparable share basis. This presentation will be posted in the Investors section of the Web site under Presentations. The analyst call will also be available for replay on the Internet for one year.

Baxter will give a presentation to analysts on Tuesday, Nov. 7, 2006, at the Edison Electric Institute 41st Annual Financial Conference.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes the impact of the severe 2006 storms. Ameren believes this information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on Amerens results of operations and earnings per share.
