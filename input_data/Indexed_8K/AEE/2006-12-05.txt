Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On November 29, 2006, Ameren Corporation (the Company) adopted the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan (the New Deferred Compensation Plan), which merges the portion of the Ameren Corporation Executive Incentive Compensation Program Elective Deferral Provisions for Members of the Ameren Leadership Team which relates to post-2004 deferrals into the portion of the Ameren Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan which relates to post-2004 deferrals and amends and restates the foregoing. The New Deferred Compensation Plan permits deferrals of a portion of salary and all or a portion of cash incentive award compensation. The New Deferred Compensation Plan is effective as of January 1, 2007 and will apply to compensation paid to participants on and after such date. A copy of the New Deferred Compensation Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
Under the New Deferred Compensation Plan, executive officers and certain key employees may annually (or the first day of the month following the commencement of employment or promotion) choose to defer up to 50 percent (in one percent increments) of their salary and up to 100 percent (in one percent increments or amounts in excess of a threshold) for cash incentive awards. At the request of a participant, the Company may, in its discretion, waive the 50 percent limitation. There are no minimum dollar thresholds for deferrals. Deferred amounts under the New Deferred Compensation Plan earn interest at 150 percent of the average Mergents Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond Yield Index (Mergents Index, formerly called Moodys Index) rate while the participant is employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. After the participant terminates employment for any reason, the deferred amounts under the New Deferred Compensation Plan earn the average Mergents Index rate. For 2006, the average Mergents Index rate was 5.24 percent, 150 percent of which was 7.86 percent. Interest rates are calculated annually as of January 1.
 
A participant may choose to receive the deferred amounts at retirement in a lump sum payment or in installments over a set period of up to 15 years. In the event a participant terminates employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to age 55, the balance in such participants deferral account is distributable in a lump sum to the participant within 30 days of the date the participant terminates employment. In the event a participant terminates employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to age 55 and after the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in Amended and Restated Ameren Corporation Change of Control Severance Plan, which Plan was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 16, 2006 as an exhibit to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 10, 2006) the balance in such participants deferral account, including interest payable at 150 percent of the average Mergents Index rate, is distributable in a lump sum to the participant within 30 days of the date the participant terminates employment.
 
 
 
On November 29, 2006, the Company adopted the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan for Members of the Board of Directors (the New Directors Deferred Compensation Plan), which amends and restates the portion of the Ameren Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Members of the Board of Directors which is subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The New Directors Deferred Compensation Plan permits non-management directors of the Company to annually (or on the first day of the month following initial election to the Board) choose to defer up to 100 percent (in increments of one percent) of cash retainers and meeting fees. There are no minimum dollar thresholds for deferrals. The New Directors Deferred Compensation Plan is effective as of January 1, 2007 and will apply to cash retainers and meeting fees paid to non-management directors on and after such date. Deferred amounts earn interest at 150 percent of the average Mergents Index rate while the participant is a member of the Companys Board of Directors. After the participant ceases to be a member of the Companys Board of Directors for any reason after attainment of at least age 55 or dies, the deferred amounts earn interest at the average Mergents Index rate. Interest rates are calculated annually as of January 1. A copy of the New Directors Deferred Compensation Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
A participant may choose to receive the deferred amounts upon ceasing to be a member of the Companys Board of Directors in a lump sum payment or in installments over a set period of up to 15 years. However, in the event a participant ceases being a member of the Companys Board of Directors prior to age 55, the balance in such participants deferral account shall be distributed in a lump sum to the participant within 30 days of the date the participant ceases being a member of the Companys Board of Directors. In the event a participant ceases being a member of the Companys Board of Directors prior to attainment of at least 55 years of age and after the occurrence of a Change of Control, the balance in such directors deferral account, including interest payable at 150 percent of the average Mergents Index rate, shall be distributed in a lump sum to the director within 30 days after the date the director ceases being a member of the Board of Directors.

Exhibit 10.1
WHEREAS, Ameren Corporation (Ameren) previously established the Ameren Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (Plan) for certain of its employees; and
WHEREAS, Ameren previously established the Ameren Corporation Executive Incentive Compensation Program Elective Deferral Provisions for Members of the Ameren Leadership Team (EIC Plan); and
WHEREAS, effective January 1, 2005, Ameren began administering both the Plan and the EIC Plan with respect to amounts deferred on and after January 1, 2005 in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and
WHEREAS, effective January 1, 2007, Ameren desires to merge the portions of the EIC Plan into the Plan which relate to post-2004 deferrals and restate the Plan;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, effective January 1, 2007, the portion of the EIC Plan which relates to post-2004 deferrals is merged into the portion of the Plan which relates to post-2004 deferrals and the Plan is amended, restated and renamed as follows:
 
 
 
 
Page 1
For purposes of Sections 8 and 9, a Participant who transfers employment to any 
subsidiary of Ameren Corporation or other business entity in which Ameren 
Corporation has a ten percent (10%) or greater ownership interest shall be deemed 
not to have terminated employment as long as such Participant is an employee of 
such a subsidiary or business entity.

Salary and/or an Incentive Award may be made within 30 days after the date the employee becomes eligible to participate in the Plan (and any other plan (as defined in Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A) of deferred compensation) with respect to services to be performed subsequent to the election, which shall be irrevocable during such initial year of participation. With respect to an Incentive Award, such initial election shall apply only to the portion of such compensation equal to the total amount of compensation for the performance period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days remaining in the performance period after the election over the total number of days in the performance period. However, an election with respect to an Incentive Award may apply to the entire Incentive Award, if elected by the Participant, and/or be made at a later date if otherwise permitted under subsection (b) above.
 
 
 
Page 4
 
At the time that a Participant makes an election to defer Salary and/or Incentive Awards under the Plan, he shall select a method for the distribution of the balance of that Deferral Account. Upon Retirement, the balance of each of the Participants Deferral Account(s) shall be distributed to the Participant according to the pay-out method selected by the Participant; provided that, any Deferral Account which is subject to a scheduled payment option pursuant to Section 10 as of the year in which the Participant retires or a year following the year in which a Participant retires shall be paid under Alternative 1. A Participant may elect to receive his account distribution as a lump sum or in substantially equal installments over a set period up to 15 years. Under either payment method, a Participant can elect to commence distribution at the time of Retirement or defer such payment(s) until March 1 of the calendar year following Retirement. (For example, a Participant whose Retirement is effective June 1, 2007, may defer payment from his Deferral Account(s) until March 1, 2008.) Notwithstanding a Participants election, payment of benefits shall not be made or commence under this Section 8 prior to the date which is 6 months after the date of a Participants Retirement in the case of a Participant who is determined to be a Specified Employee at the time of his Retirement. Any payments (with interest calculated at the Plan Interest Rate) that would have been paid during such 6-month period shall be paid in a lump sum to the Participant as of the day after the last day of such 6-month period, and all other payments following such 6-month period shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Participants election.
 
 
Page 5
 
Installment payments (Alternatives 3 through 8), may be received either monthly or on an annual basis. The distribution options available in circumstances where the Participant dies, either before or after Retirement, or is placed on disability status prior to Retirement are described in Sections 10 and 11. The deferral of payments to the calendar year following Retirement (Alternatives 2, 4, 6 and 8) is not permitted in cases of death or long-term disability.

The Claimant or his duly authorized representative shall be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to his claim. If the Claimant does not
 
Page 12
 
 
request a review of the Companys determination within such 60-day period, he shall be barred and estopped from challenging its determination.
Within sixty (60) days after the Companys receipt of a request for review, it will review its prior determination. After considering all materials presented by the Claimant, the Company will render a written opinion setting forth the specific reasons for his decision and containing specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which his decision is based. If special circumstances require that the 60-day period be extended, the Company will so notify the Claimant and will render the decision as soon as possible but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the request for review. If the Company makes an adverse benefit determination on review, the Company will render a written opinion using language calculated to be understood by the Claimant setting forth:
1.   
the specific reason or reasons for denial,
2.   
specific references to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based,
3.   
a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents,

Exhibit 10.2
WHEREAS, Ameren Corporation (Ameren) previously established the Ameren Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Members of the Board of Directors (Plan); and
WHEREAS, effective January 1, 2007, Ameren desires to amend and restate the portion of the Plan which is subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code) to make certain changes;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, effective January 1, 2007, the portion of the Plan which is subject to Code Section 409A is amended, restated and renamed as follows:
 
 
 
 
The purpose of the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan for Members of the Board of Directors (Plan) is to provide members of the Board of Directors of Ameren Corporation (Ameren) with the opportunity to accumulate capital and postpone the income taxes thereon by deferring the receipt of up to 100 percent of their Directors Retainer Fee and/or Meeting Stipends. Participation in the Plan is voluntary. The Plan is administered by Ameren Services Company (the Company).
Effective January 1, 2005, Ameren began administering the Plan to the extent necessary to incorporate requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). Deferred Amounts which were nonforfeitable as of December 31, 2004 shall be grandfathered and shall be governed by the Pre-2005 Document. Deferred Amounts credited to a Participants Deferral Account on or after January 1, 2007 shall be governed by the provisions of this document.
Certain words and phrases are defined when first used in later paragraphs of the Plan. In addition, the following words and phrases when used herein, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, shall have the following respective meanings:
 
 
Page 1
 
Effective January 1, 1998, upon termination of the CIPS and CIPSCO Directors Deferred Compensation Plans and the Directors Retirement Plans, a board member whose balance was transferred from these terminated plans into this Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan for Members of the Board of Directors immediately became a participant in the Plan on such transfer date.
          3.  
ELIGIBILITY
Members of the Board of Directors of Ameren who are receiving a Directors Retainer Fee and/or Meeting Stipend from Ameren shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Any individual who is eligible to participate in the Plan may become a Participant by commencing a Deferral Commitment.
A.     
Maximum Deferrals:
A Participant may commence a Deferral Commitment by making an election to defer a percentage of his Directors Retainer Fee and/or his Meeting Stipend in the manner set forth in Section 5. A Participant may defer a percentage of his Directors Retainer Fee and/or Meeting Stipend up to a maximum of 100 percent.
Page 2
B.      
Irrevocability of Deferral Commitment:
During a Plan Year, a Deferral Commitment shall be irrevocable, and the deferral percentage elected by the Participant thereunder shall not be increased or decreased.
C.      
Term of Deferral Commitment:
The term of a Deferral Commitment shall be the Plan Year.
D.      
Crediting of Deferred Amounts:
The Participants Deferred Amounts shall be credited to his Deferral Account by no later than the end of the month in which such amounts would, but for such deferral, be payable to the Participant.
A written deferral election for a Plan Year shall indicate: (a) the percentage amount the Participant is electing to defer under the Plan; (b) whether the Participant wishes to defer his Directors Retainer Fee, his Directors Meeting Stipend or both; and (c) the method of distribution of such amounts, as permitted under Section 8. Such election form shall be filed by the Participant with the Company by no later than the last date specified by the Company for such filing. Such election shall be effective on the first day of the next Plan Year. In the case of a Participant who becomes eligible during a Plan Year, an election to defer may be made within 30 days after the date he or she becomes eligible to participate in the Plan (and any other plan (as defined in Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code Section 409A) of deferred compensation) with respect to services to be performed subsequent to the election, which shall be irrevocable during such initial year of participation. Such election shall be effective no earlier than the first day of the month following the date he or she becomes a member of the Board of Directors of Ameren.
There shall be established a Deferral Account in the name of each Participant who elects to defer his Directors Retainer Fee and/or Meeting Stipend by commencing a Deferral Commitment under the provisions of the Plan. A separate Deferral Account will be maintained for each Deferral Commitment commenced by each Participant. The Deferral Account shall reflect the value of the Participant's Deferred Amounts plus Interest credited thereon with respect to the specific Deferral Commitment. The records for each Deferral Account maintained by the Company for the Participant shall be available for inspection by the Participant at reasonable times, and the Company shall make available to the Participant a statement indicating the aggregate amount credited to each of the Participants Deferral Accounts and the value of each such Deferral Account.
 
Page 3
 
Interest calculated at the rate or rates, as hereinafter described, shall accrue from the date deferrals are credited to the Participants Deferral Account and shall be compounded annually and credited to the Participants Deferral Account as of the last business day of each Plan Year (or as of such other dates as determined by the Company) for which the Participant has a Deferral Account balance. While the Participant is a member of the Board of Directors of Ameren, the Participants Deferral Account balance shall earn Interest at the Plan Interest Rate. After Retirement from the Board of Directors or following the death of the Participant, the Participants Deferral Account balance shall earn Interest at the Base Interest Rate.
Interest rates are calculated annually as of the first day of the Plan Year. The Plan Interest Rate for any Plan Year shall be 150 percent of the average Mergents Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond Yield Index (Mergents Index, formerly called Moodys Index) for the previous calendar year.
The Base Interest Rate for any Plan Year shall be equal to the average Mergents Index for the previous calendar year.
Upon Retirement, the balance of each of a Participants Deferral Accounts shall be distributed to the Participant, each according to the pay-out method selected by the Participant, beginning no later than the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participants Retirement occurs. In the event the balances of one or more of the Participants Deferral Accounts are to be distributed as a single lump sum, such distribution shall take place no later than the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participants Retirement occurs.
A.          
Distribution Alternatives:
At the time that a Participant makes an election to defer his Directors Retainer Fee and/or Meeting Stipends under the Plan, the Participant shall select a method for the distribution of the balance of that Deferral Account at Retirement by choosing one of the following alternative methods of distribution:
 
 
Page 4
(Methods 2 through 4 shall be payable either in monthly or annual installments as elected by the Participant or his beneficiary.)
B.             
Subsequent Election Changes
:
 
Except as described in Paragraph B below, in the event that a Participant ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors after completing one or more Deferral Commitments but prior to becoming eligible for Retirement, the balance of the Participants corresponding Deferral Account(s) shall be distributed in a single sum to the Participant no later than 30 days after the date the Participant ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors.
In the event that a Participant ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors after completing one or more Deferral Commitments but prior to becoming eligible for Retirement and after the occurrence of a Change of Control, the balance of the Participants Deferral Account(s), including Interest calculated at the Plan Interest Rate, shall be distributed in a single sum to the Participant no later than 30 days after the date the Participant ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors. For the purposes of this Paragraph, Change of Control shall have the same meaning that it has in the Amended and Restated Ameren Corporation Change of Control Severance Plan.
In the event that it is determined by a duly licensed physician selected by the Company that, because of ill health, accident or other disability, a Participant is no longer able, properly and satisfactorily, to perform his regular duties and responsibilities as a member of the Board of
 
 
Page 5
 
Directors, the Company shall commence distribution of the Participants Deferral Account(s) according to the method(s) of distribution selected by the Participant pursuant to Section 8 no later than the tenth day of the first month following the date of the physicians disability determination, but only if the Participant is disabled within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(C).
 
A.            
Prior to Retirement
In the event that a Participant (or in the case of the Participants death, his beneficiary) suffers a Financial Hardship, the Company may, if it deems advisable in its sole and absolute discretion, distribute on behalf of the Participant or his beneficiary, any portion of the Participants Deferral Account(s), but in no event more than the amount reasonably necessary to relieve the Financial Hardship upon which the request is based, plus the federal and state taxes due on the withdrawal, as determined by the Company. Any such hardship distribution shall be made at such times as the Company shall determine, and the Participants Deferral Account(s) shall be reduced by the amount so distributed and/or utilized. Financial Hardship means a severe financial hardship to a Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, his or her spouse or a dependent (as defined in Code Section 152(a)) of the Participant, loss of the Participants property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant.
The Participant shall designate in writing, on a form to be furnished by the Company, one or more primary and/or secondary beneficiaries who shall receive distributions otherwise payable to the Participant or as otherwise authorized by the Plan, and such beneficiary designation shall be controlling with respect to all Deferral Accounts such Participant may have pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Participants spouse, if any, must consent in writing to the designation of a primary beneficiary(ies) other than such spouse as the sole primary beneficiary. Subject to the requirement of the preceding sentence, the Participant
 
 
Page 6
 
shall have the right, at any time and for any reason, to submit a revised designation of beneficiary. Such revised designation of beneficiary shall become effective provided it is delivered to the Company prior to the death of such Participant, and it shall supersede all prior designations of beneficiary submitted by the Participant. A beneficiary may be a natural person or an entity (such as a trust or a charitable organization).
If no designation of beneficiary has been received by the Company from the Participant prior to his death, or if the beneficiary(ies) designated by the Participant has not survived the Participant or cannot otherwise be located by the Company within a reasonable period of time, distributions shall be made to the person or persons in the first of the following classes of successive preference:
 
If the Participants beneficiary is in payment status and subsequently dies prior to receiving his/her final payment under the Plan, all remaining payments (except for any applicable survivor benefit payments as outlined in Section 13) will be made to the Participants secondary beneficiary, as elected prior to the Participants death. If no secondary beneficiary designation was received by the Company from the Participant prior to his death, or if the secondary beneficiary(ies) designated by the Participant is no longer living or cannot otherwise be located by the Company within a reasonable period of time, all remaining distributions shall be determined in the order outlined in the preceding paragraph.
Whenever, in the Companys opinion, a person entitled to receive any payment under the Plan is a minor, is under a legal or other disability or is so incapacitated as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, a distribution may be made to such person or to his legal representative or to a relative or friend of such person for his benefit, or for the benefit of such person in whatever manner the Company considers advisable. Any payment of a benefit in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be a complete discharge of any liability for the making of such payment under the provisions of the Plan.
Except as specified otherwise in the Plan, the Company shall have full power and discretion to administer, construe and interpret the Plan. Any authorized action or decision under the provisions of the Plan undertaken by the Company arising out of, or in connection with the administration, construction, interpretation or effect of the Plan, or recommendations in accordance therewith, or any rules and regulations adopted by the Company shall be
 
Page 7
 
conclusive and binding on all Participants and their beneficiaries and all other persons whosoever.
 
 
Page 8
 
Ameren in his present capacity, or in any capacity for any term of years. It is expressly understood that the Plan relates to the payment of deferred compensation for the Participants director services normally distributable after termination of such services, and the Plan is not in any way intended to be a contract for the Participants services.
 
 
 
Page 9
 
Any claim for arbitration may be submitted as follows: if the Participant or his beneficiary(ies) disagrees with the Company regarding the interpretation of the Plan and the claim is finally denied by the Company in whole or in part, such claim may be filed in writing with an arbitrator of the Participants or his beneficiary(ies)s choice who is selected by the method described in the following paragraph.
The Participant or his beneficiary(ies) shall submit to the Company a list of five potential arbitrators. Each of the five arbitrators so listed must be either (1) a member of the American Arbitration Association who is also a resident of the State of Missouri or (2) a retired Missouri Circuit Court of Court of Appeals Court judge. Within one week after receipt of said list, the Company shall select one of the five arbitrators as the arbitrator for the dispute in question and notify said arbitrator of his selection. If the Company fails to select an arbitrator in a timely manner, the Participant or his beneficiary(ies) shall then designate one of the five arbitrators as the arbitrator for the dispute in question.
The arbitration hearing shall be held within seven days (or as soon thereafter as possible) after the selection of the arbitrator. No continuance of said hearing shall be allowed without the mutual consent of the Participant or his beneficiary(ies) and the Company. Absence from or nonparticipation at the hearing by either the Participant, or his beneficiary(ies), or the Company shall not prevent the issuance of an award by the arbitrator. Hearing procedures, which will expedite the hearing, may be ordered at the arbitrators discretion, and the arbitrator may close the hearing in his sole discretion when he decides he has heard sufficient evidence to justify the issuance of an award.
Page 10
The arbitration award may be enforced in any appropriate court as soon as possible after its issuance. For the purposes of apportioning expenses and fees, the Company will be considered to the prevailing party in a dispute if the arbitrator determines (1) that Ameren has not breached its obligations or duties under the provisions of the Plan and (2) the claim of the Participant or his beneficiary(ies) was not made in good faith. Otherwise, the Participant or his beneficiary(ies) will be considered to be the prevailing party. In the event that Ameren is the prevailing party, the fee of the arbitrator and all necessary expenses of the hearing (excluding any attorneys fees incurred by the Company) including the fees of stenographic reporting, if employed, shall be paid by the Participant or beneficiary(ies). In the event that the Participant or his beneficiary(ies) is the prevailing party, the fee of the arbitrator and all necessary expenses of the hearing (including all attorneys fees incurred by the Participant or his beneficiary(ies) in pursuing his claim), including the fees of stenographic reporting, if employed, shall be paid by the Company.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the foregoing restatement was adopted on
November 29, 2006.
