ITEM 1.01
 
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Ameren Corporation (Ameren) previously announced that certain of its subsidiaries had entered into a new, multi-year committed bank credit facility (see Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 13, 2007 (the February 13 Form 8-K)).
After receipt of required regulatory approvals, effective March 9, 2007, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP and collectively with CIPS and CILCO, the Ameren Illinois Utilities) became authorized to make borrowings and obtain letters of credit for their benefit under the $500 million multi-year, senior secured Credit Agreement, dated as of February 9, 2007 (the 2007 Credit Agreement) described in the February 13 Form 8-K. A copy of the 2007 Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the February 13 Form 8-K.
From March 9, 2007, IP is authorized to make borrowings and obtain letters of credit for its benefit up to $200 million under the 2007 Credit Agreement (in addition to the $150 million of authority it has under a Credit Agreement dated July 14, 2006 (the 2006 Illinois Credit Agreement)). CIPS and CILCO will continue to have borrowing capacity of $135 million and $150 million, respectively, under the 2006 Illinois Credit Agreement, but each will have the option of permanently reducing its borrowing capacity under the 2006 Illinois Credit Agreement and shifting, in one or more transactions, such capacity to the 2007 Credit Agreement up to the same limits. Until such time as CIPS or CILCO elects to increase its borrowing capacity under the 2007 Credit Agreement and issue first mortgage bonds as security for its obligations thereunder (as described in the February 13 Form 8-K and below), it will not constitute a Borrower under the 2007 Credit Agreement and will not be subject to the covenants thereof (except as a subsidiary of a Borrower).
See the February 13 Form 8-K for a summary of the terms of the 2007 Credit Agreement applicable to the Ameren Illinois Utilities. Each of the Ameren Illinois Utilities has entered into a Supplemental Indenture providing for the issuance of mortgage bonds as security for its obligations under the 2007 Credit Agreement. Copies of such Supplemental Indentures are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6.
ITEM 2.03
 
Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-
Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
See Item 1.01 of the February 13 Form 8-K for a description of the 2007 Credit Agreement, a copy of which was attached thereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
To secure its obligations under the 2007 Credit Agreement, CIPS has authorized the issuance of up to $135,000,000 of its First Mortgage Bonds, 2007 Credit Agreement Series (the CIPS Credit Agreement Bonds) under its Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated October 1, 1941, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 1, 2007 (filed herewith as Exhibit 4.2) (the CIPS Mortgage).
To secure its obligations under the 2007 Credit Agreement, CILCO has authorized the issuance of up to $150,000,000 of its First Mortgage Bonds, 2007 Credit Agreement Series (the CILCO Credit Agreement Bonds) under its Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 1, 2007 (filed herewith as Exhibit 4.4) (the CILCO Mortgage).
To secure its obligations under the 2007 Credit Agreement, IP has issued $200,000,000 of its Mortgage Bonds, 2007 Credit Agreement Series (the IP Credit Agreement Bonds, and together with the CIPS Credit Agreement Bonds and the CILCO Credit Agreement Bonds, the Credit Agreement Bonds) under its General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 1, 2007 (filed herewith as Exhibit 4.6) (the IP Mortgage).
The IP Credit Agreement Bonds were issued and delivered, and the CIPS Credit Agreement Bonds and the
 
-3-
 
CILCO Credit Agreement Bonds will be issued and delivered to the extent such company increases its borrowing capacity under the 2007 Credit Agreement, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as agent for the lenders under the 2007 Credit Agreement in order to evidence and secure the respective obligations of the Ameren Illinois Utilities under the 2007 Credit Agreement to make payments to the lenders under the 2007 Credit Agreement and to provide the lenders the benefit of the lien of the CIPS Mortgage, the CILCO Mortgage and the IP Mortgage, respectively, with respect to the applicable Credit Agreement Bonds.
The obligation of each Ameren Illinois Utility to make payments with respect to principal under the 2007 Credit Agreement will not give rise to an obligation to pay principal of the respective Credit Agreement Bonds except on the maturity date of such Ameren Illinois Utilitys obligations under the 2007 Credit Agreement or upon redemption of such Credit Agreement Bonds. Upon the occurrence of a default and an acceleration of an Ameren Illinois Utilitys obligations under the 2007 Credit Agreement, and upon notice given by the agent to the respective trustee under the CIPS Mortgage, the CILCO Mortgage or the IP Mortgage, as the case may be, the Credit Agreement Bonds of the applicable Ameren Illinois Utility will be subject to immediate redemption in the amount of all obligations owed by such Ameren Illinois Utility under the 2007 Credit Agreement.
If any Ameren Illinois Utilitys borrowing limit is permanently reduced under the 2007 Credit Agreement, such Ameren Illinois Utilitys obligation under its Credit Agreement Bond will be deemed discharged to that extent. The obligation of each Ameren Illinois Utility to make payments with respect to the interest on its Credit Agreement Bonds will be satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees of such Ameren Illinois Utility under the 2007 Credit Agreement has been paid. If any payment is made on interest and/or fees of an Ameren Illinois Utility under the 2007 Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest or fees on the respective Credit Agreement Bonds shall be deemed discharged in the same amount.
The Credit Agreement Bonds do not contain any provision regarding the release of the lien of the mortgage in the event of the retirement or redemption of all other mortgage bonds subject to the lien of the respective mortgage.

CENTRAL ILLINOIS PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY, an Illinois corporation (hereinafter referred to as the 
Company
), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Owner specified above, as agent (in such capacity, the Agent) for the Lenders (as defined below) under the Credit Agreement, dated as of February 9, 2007, by and among the Company, Central Illinois Light Company, Illinois Power Company, AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company and CILCORP Inc., as borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the 
Lenders
) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the 
Credit Agreement
), or registered assigns, the Principal Amount
 
3
 
 
specified above or such lesser principal amount as shall be equal to the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company outstanding on the Maturity Date (having at any time the meaning such term has at such time under the Credit Agreement) of the Company, but not in excess of the Principal Amount of this bond, and to pay interest thereon at the Interest Rate (as defined below) until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment on the Maturity Date or in the event of redemption of this bond, until the redemption date.
 
Interest on this bond shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date (as defined below), commencing on the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the date of this bond. If the Maturity Date falls on a day which is not a Business Day, as defined below, principal and any interest and/or fees payable with respect to the Maturity Date will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day. The interest payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 1, 2007, hereinafter referred to, be paid to the person in whose name this bond (or one or more predecessor bonds) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below); provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof shall be payable. Should the Company default in the payment of interest (Defaulted Interest), the Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the person in whose name this bond is registered on the Record Date to be established by the Trustee for payment of such Defaulted Interest. As used herein, (A) Business Day shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Credit Agreement; (B) Interest Payment Date shall mean each date on which Company Obligations constituting interest and/or fees are due and payable from time to time pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (C) Interest Rate shall mean a rate of interest per annum, adjusted as necessary, to result in an interest payment equal to the aggregate amount of Company Obligations constituting interest and fees of the Company due under the Credit Agreement on the applicable Interest Payment Date; and (D) Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall mean the day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
Both the principal of and the interest on this bond shall be payable in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Trustee, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
 
This bond is one of the bonds issued and to be issued from time to time under and in accordance with and all secured by the indenture of mortgage or deed of trust dated October 1, 1941, executed and delivered by the Company to U.S. Bank National Association (formerly U.S. Bank Trust National Association, formerly First Trust National Association, formerly First Trust of Illinois, National Association, successor trustee to Bank of America Illinois, formerly Continental Bank, formerly Continental Bank, National Association and formerly Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago and hereinafter referred to as the 
Trustee
) and Edmond B. Stofft, as Trustees, and the various indentures supplemental thereto, including the Supplemental Indenture pursuant to which $135,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the First Mortgage Bonds, 2007 Credit Agreement Series (the 
2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds
) are authorized, each executed and delivered by the Company to the Trustees under said indenture of mortgage or deed of trust dated October 1, 1941, prior to the authentication of this bond (said indenture of mortgage or deed of trust and said supplemental
 
4
 
 indentures being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the 
Indenture
); and said U.S. Bank National Association and Richard Prokosch (successor Co-Trustee), of the City of Oakdale, Washington County, State of Minnesota, as Trustees (successor Co-Trustee) being now the Trustees under the Indenture. Reference to the Indenture and to all supplemental indentures, if any, hereafter executed pursuant to the Indenture is hereby made for a description of the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders and Registered Owners of said bonds and of the Trustees and of the Company in respect of such security. By the terms of the Indenture the bonds to be secured thereby are issuable in series, which may vary as to date, amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, redemption provisions, medium of payment and in other respects as in the Indenture provided.
 
The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds
 
are to be issued and delivered to the Agent in order to evidence and secure the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement to make payments to the Lenders under the Credit Agreement and to provide the Lenders the benefit of the lien of the Indenture with respect to the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to principal under the Credit Agreement shall not give rise to an obligation to pay principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds except on the Maturity Date of the Company or upon redemption hereof. If at any time any permanent reduction of the Borrower Sublimit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company or the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company shall result in the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds being greater than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure, a payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds in the amount of such excess shall be deemed discharged upon the effectiveness of such permanent reduction. No payment of principal under the Credit Agreement shall reduce the principal amount of the
 
2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds to an amount less than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on the 2007
 
Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as such payment made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal of or interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds has not been made, (ii) that the Company is
 
 
5
 
in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Agent in connection with the Company Obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
 
This bond is not redeemable except upon written demand of the Agent following the occurrence of a Default by the Company under the Credit Agreement and the acceleration of the Company Obligations, as provided under the Credit Agreement.
 
In case of certain events of default specified in the Indenture, the principal of this bond may be declared or may become due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof or of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, to or against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, of the Company, or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company, or such predecessor or successor corporation, under any constitution or statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment, penalty, or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, stockholders, directors and officers being waived and released by the Registered Owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Indenture.
 
This bond shall not be assignable or transferable except to a successor Agent appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement. This bond is exchangeable by the Registered Owner hereof, in person or by attorney duly authorized, at the principal office or place of business of the Trustee under the Indenture, upon the surrender and cancellation of this bond and the payment of any stamp tax or other governmental charge, and upon any such exchange a new registered bond or bonds without coupons, of the same series and maturity and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued in exchange heretofore; provided, that the Company shall not be required to exchange any bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series for a period of ten (10) days next preceding an Interest Payment Date with respect to such bonds.
 
The Agent shall surrender this bond to the Trustee when each of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure have been reduced to zero and all fees and other amounts payable by the Company pursuant to the Credit Agreement with respect to the Company Obligations shall have been duly paid.
 
This bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose unless and until it shall have been authenticated by the execution by the Trustee or its successor in trust under the Indenture of the Trustees Certificate endorsed hereon.
 
6
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Central Illinois Public Service Company has caused this bond to be executed in its name by the manual or facsimile signature of its President or one of its Vice-Presidents, and its corporate seal or a facsimile thereof to be affixed or imprinted hereon and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.
 
 
This bond is one of the bonds of the series designated therein, described in the within mentioned Indenture.
 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) duly paid by the Trustees to the Company, and of other good and valuable considerations, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, and for the purpose of further securing the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on all bonds which have been heretofore or shall be hereafter issued under the Indenture and indentures supplemental thereto and which shall be at any time outstanding thereunder and secured thereby and $135,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series, and for the purpose of securing the faithful performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions set forth in the Indenture and/or in any indenture supplemental thereto, the Company has given, granted, bargained, sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, mortgaged, warranted the title to and conveyed, and by these presents does give, grant, bargain, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, mortgage, warrant the title to and convey unto U.S. Bank National Association and Richard Prokosch (successor Co-Trustee), of the City of Oakdale, Washington County, State of Minnesota, as Trustees, as Trustees under the Indenture as therein provided, and their successors in the trusts thereby created, and to their assigns, all the right, title and interest of the Company
 
 
7
 
in and to any and all premises, plants, property, leases and leaseholds, franchises, permits, rights and powers, of every kind and description, real and personal, which have been acquired by the Company through construction, purchase, consolidation or merger, or otherwise, subsequent to January 1, 2006, and which are owned by the Company at the date of the execution hereof, together with the rents, issues, products and profits therefrom, excepting, however, and there is hereby expressly reserved and excluded from the lien and effect of the Indenture and of this supplemental indenture, all right, title and interest of the Company, now owned, in and to (a) all cash, bonds, shares of stock, obligations and other securities not deposited with the Trustee or Trustees under the Indenture, and (b) all accounts and bills receivable, judgments (other than for the recovery of real property or establishing a lien or charge thereon or right therein) and chooses in action not specifically assigned to and pledged with the Trustee or Trustees under the Indenture, and (c) all personal property acquired or manufactured by the Company for sale, lease, rental or consumption in the ordinary course of business, and (d) the last day of each of the demised terms created by any lease of property leased to the Company and under each and every renewal of any such lease, the last day of each and every such demised term being hereby expressly reserved to and by the Company, and (e) all gas, oil and other minerals now or hereafter existing upon, within or under any real estate of the Company subject to, or hereby subjected to, the lien of the Indenture.
 
And upon the considerations and for the purposes aforesaid, and in order to provide, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, for the issuance under the Indenture, as hereby amended, of bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series and to fix the terms, provisions and characteristics of the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series, and to modify or amend the Indenture in the particulars and to the extent hereinafter in this supplemental indenture specifically provided, the Company hereby covenants and agrees with the Trustees as follows:
 
 
Section 1.1
  
A series of bonds issuable under the Indenture, as hereby amended, to be known and designated as 
First Mortgage Bonds, 2007 Credit Agreement Series
 and which shall be executed, authenticated and issued only in the form of registered bonds without coupons, is hereby created and authorized. The bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series and the Trustees Certificate to be endorsed thereon shall be substantially in the form thereof hereinbefore recited (the 
Bond Form
). Each bond of 2007 Credit Agreement Series is to be issued and registered in the name of the Agent under the Credit Agreement to evidence and secure any and all Obligations (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company (the 
Company Obligations
) under the Credit Agreement. Each bond of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be dated as of the Interest Payment Date (as defined below) thereof to which interest was paid next preceding the date of issue, unless (a) issued on an Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated as of such issue date, or (b) issued prior to the occurrence of the first Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated the date of original issuance.
 
The bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be issued in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $135,000,000 and shall mature on the Maturity Date (having at any time the meaning such term has at such time under the Credit Agreement) of the Company. The principal amount of bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series outstanding from time to time
 
8
 
 
shall always be equal to the greater of (i) the Companys Borrower Sublimit (as defined in the Credit Agreement, without giving effect to clause (ii) of such definition) and (ii) the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company on the Maturity Date, but not in excess of $135,000,000. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company must at any time it increases its Borrower Sublimit deliver additional bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series in an amount such that the requirement of the preceding sentence is at that time satisfied. Upon submission of the appropriate certificates and opinions as required under the Indenture, the Company may so issue and the Trustee shall authenticate from time to time bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series at any time on or prior to January 14, 2010.
 
The bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall bear interest from their date as set forth in the Bond Form. Interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date (as defined below), commencing on the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the date of the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series. If the Maturity Date falls on a day which is not a Business Day, as defined below, principal and any interest and/or fees payable by the Company with respect to the Maturity Date will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day.
 
Both the principal of and the interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be payable at the times and in the manner set forth in the form of bond set out herein and in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Trustee, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
 
Section 1.2
  
Anything contained in Section 14 of Article I of the Indenture, or elsewhere in the Indenture, to the contrary notwithstanding, only the person in whose name bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series are registered (the 
Registered Owner
) at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below) with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the cancellation of such bonds upon any transfer or exchange subsequent to the Record Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date;
provided, however
, that if and to the extent the Company shall default in the payment of the interest due on such Interest Payment Date, such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names outstanding bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series are registered on the Record Date to be established by the Trustee for payment of such defaulted interest.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to principal under the Credit Agreement shall not give rise to an obligation to pay principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds except on the Maturity Date of the Company or upon redemption as provided in this Supplemental Indenture. If at any time any permanent reduction of the Borrower Sublimit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company or the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company shall result in the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds being greater than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure, a payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds in the amount of such excess shall be deemed discharged upon the effectiveness of such permanent reduction. No payment of principal under the Credit

Agreement shall reduce the principal amount of the
 
2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds to an amount less than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as such payment made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal of or interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Agent in connection with the Company Obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.

The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture and any other notice required under the Indenture, including notice to be given by the Company, shall be deemed satisfied by the notice given by the Agent as aforesaid. Upon surrender of the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series by the Agent to the Trustee, the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the aggregate amount of the Company Obligations.

WHEREAS, the Indenture provides for the issuance of bonds thereunder in one or more series, the form of which series of bonds to be substantially in the form set forth therein with such insertions, omissions and variations as the Board of Directors of the Company may determine; and

Notwithstanding any provisions hereof or in the Indenture this Bond is not assignable or transferable except to a successor Agent appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement, dated as of February 9, 2007, hereinafter referred to.
 
 
 
 
Central Illinois Light Company, a corporation of the State of Illinois (hereinafter called the Company), for value received, hereby promises to pay to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent (in such capacity, the Agent) for the Lenders (as defined below) under the Credit Agreement, dated as of February 9, 2007, by and among the Company, Central Illinois Public Service Company, Illinois Power Company, AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company and CILCORP Inc., as borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), or registered assigns, the principal amount specified above or such lesser principal amount as shall be equal to the amount of the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company outstanding on the Maturity Date (having at any time the meaning such term has at such time under the Credit Agreement) of the Company, but not in excess of the principal amount of this bond, and to pay interest thereon at the Interest Rate (as defined below) until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment on the Maturity Date or in the event of redemption of this bond, until the redemption date.
 
Interest on this bond shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date (as defined below), commencing on the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the date of this bond. If the Maturity Date falls on a day which is not a Business Day, as defined below, principal and any interest and/or fees payable with respect to the Maturity Date will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day. The interest payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 1, 2007, hereinafter referred to, be paid to the person in whose name this bond (or one or more predecessor bonds) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below); provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof shall be payable. Should the Company default in the payment of interest (Defaulted Interest), the Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the person in whose name this bond is registered on the Record Date to be established by the Trustee for
 
3
 
 
payment of such Defaulted Interest. As used herein, (A) Business Day shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Credit Agreement; (B) Interest Payment Date shall mean each date on which Company Obligations constituting interest and/or fees are due and payable from time to time pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (C) Interest Rate shall mean a rate of interest per annum, adjusted as necessary, to result in an interest payment equal to the aggregate amount of Company Obligations constituting interest and fees of the Company due under the Credit Agreement on the applicable Interest Payment Date; and (D) Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall mean the day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
Both the principal of and the interest on this bond shall be payable, in immediately available funds, at the office of the Trustee hereinafter referred to.
 
This bond is to be issued and delivered to the Agent in order to evidence and secure the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement to make payments to the Lenders under the Credit Agreement and to provide the Lenders the benefit of the lien of the Indenture with respect to the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to principal under the Credit Agreement shall not give rise to an obligation to pay principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds except on the Maturity Date of the Company or upon redemption hereof. If at any time any permanent reduction of the Borrower Sublimit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company or the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company shall result in the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds being greater than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure, a payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds in the amount of such excess shall be deemed discharged upon the effectiveness of such permanent reduction. No payment of principal under the Credit Agreement shall reduce the principal amount of the
 
2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds to an amount less than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on this bond shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on this bond shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as such payment made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on this bond, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal of or interest on this bond has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the
 
4
 
Agent in connection with the Company Obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
 
This bond is one of an issue of bonds of the Company, issuable in series, and is one of a series known as its First Mortgage Bonds of the series designated in its title, all issued and to be issued under and equally secured (except as to any sinking fund established in accordance with the provisions of the Mortgage (defined below) for the bonds of any particular series) by an Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of April 1, 1933, executed by Illinois Power Company to Bankers Trust Company (predecessor of Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas) or its successor (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

provided, however,
that no modification shall (1) extend the time, or reduce the amount, of any payment on any bond, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of the Mortgage, without the consent of the holders of all bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the above percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such modification without the consent of the holders of all bonds then outstanding.
 
The principal hereof may be declared or may become due on the conditions, with the effect, in the manner and at the time set forth in the Mortgage, upon the occurrence of a completed default as in the Mortgage provided.
 
This bond is not redeemable except upon written demand of the Agent following the occurrence of a Default by the Company under the Credit Agreement and the acceleration of the Company Obligations under the Credit Agreement.
 
In the manner and upon payment of the charges prescribed in the Mortgage, registered bonds without coupons of this series may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of fully registered bonds of other authorized denominations of the same series, upon presentation and surrender thereof, for cancellation, to the Trustee at its principal office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York.
 
This bond shall not be assignable or transferable except to a successor Agent appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Subject to the restriction on transfer of this bond hereinbefore set forth, this bond is transferable as prescribed in the Mortgage by the registered owner hereof in person, or by his duly authorized attorney, at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, upon surrender and
 
5
 
cancellation of this bond, and, thereupon, a new fully registered bond of the same series for a like principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor as provided in the Mortgage, and upon payment, if the Company shall require it, of the charges therein prescribed; provided, that the Company shall not be required to exchange any bonds of this series for a period of ten (10) days next preceding an Interest Payment Date with respect to such bonds.
 
The Agent shall surrender this bond to the Trustee when each of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure of the Company have been reduced to zero and all fees and other amounts payable by the Company pursuant to the Credit Agreement with respect to the Company Obligations shall have been duly paid.
 
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond against any incorporator or any past, present or future subscriber to the capital stock, stockholder, officer or director of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any predecessor or successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitution or by the enforcement of any assessment or otherwise, all such liability of incorporators, subscribers, stockholders, officers and directors being released by the holder or owner hereof by the acceptance of this bond and being likewise waived and released by the terms of the Mortgage.
 
This bond shall not become obligatory until Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, the Trustee under the Mortgage, or its successor thereunder, shall have signed the form of certificate endorsed hereon.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Central Illinois Light Company has caused this bond to be signed in its name by its President or a Vice President by a facsimile of his signature and a facsimile of its corporate seal to be printed hereon, attested by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary by a facsimile of his signature.

the Interest Payment Date (as defined below) thereof to which interest was paid next preceding the date of issue, unless (a) issued on an Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated as of
such issue date, or (b) issued prior to the occurrence of the first Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated the date of original issuance.
 
Definitive bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series will be issued, originally or otherwise, only as registered bonds without coupons in the name of the Agent as evidence of and security for the Company Obligations under the Credit Agreement; and they and the Trustees certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the forms hereinbefore recited, respectively.
 
The bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall not be assignable or transferable except to a successor Agent appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Subject to the restriction on transfer of the bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series hereinbefore set forth, and in the manner and upon payment of the charges prescribed in the Indenture, registered bonds without coupons of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of fully registered bonds of other authorized denominations of the same series, upon presentation and surrender thereof for cancellation, to the Trustee at its principal office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York; provided, that the Company shall not be required to exchange any bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series for a period of ten (10) days next preceding an Interest Payment Date with respect to such bonds. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14 of the Indenture, no charge shall be made upon any transfer or exchange of bonds of said series other than for any tax or taxes or other governmental charge required to be paid by the Company.
 
Except as set forth herein, the bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series are not redeemable. Upon the occurrence of a Default by the Company under the Credit Agreement and the acceleration of the Company Obligations, the bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee of a written demand from the Agent stating that there has occurred under the Credit Agreement both a Default by the Company and a declaration of acceleration of the Company Obligations and demanding redemption of the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series (including a description of the amount of principal, interest, fees, cash collateralization obligations and other amounts which comprise such Company Obligations). The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture and any other notice required under the Indenture, including notice to be given by the Company, shall be deemed satisfied by the notice given by the Agent as aforesaid. Upon surrender of the bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series by the Agent to the Trustee, the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the aggregate amount of the Company Obligations.
 
Section 2.
The principal amount of bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series outstanding from time to time shall always be equal to the greater of (i) the Companys Borrower Sublimit (as defined in the Credit Agreement, without giving effect to clause (ii) of such definition) and (ii) the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company on the Maturity Date, but not in excess of $150,000,000. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company must at any time it increases its Borrower Sublimit deliver additional bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series in an amount such that the requirement of the preceding sentence
 
9
 
is at that time satisfied. Upon submission of the appropriate certificates and opinions as required under the Indenture, the Company may so issue and the Trustee shall authenticate from time to time bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series at any time on or prior to January 14, 2010.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to principal under the Credit Agreement shall not give rise to an obligation to pay principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds except on the Maturity Date of the Company or upon redemption as provided in this Supplemental Indenture. If at any time any permanent reduction of the Borrower Sublimit of the Company or the Borrower Credit Exposure of the Company shall result in the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds being greater than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure, a payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds in the amount of such excess shall be deemed discharged upon the effectiveness of such permanent reduction. No payment of principal under the Credit Agreement shall reduce the principal amount of the
 
2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds to an amount less than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as such payment made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal of or interest on the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Agent in connection with the Company Obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
 
As used herein, (A) 
Business Day
 shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Credit Agreement; (B) 
Interest Payment Date
 shall mean each date on which Company Obligations constituting interest and/or fees are due and payable from time to time pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (C) 
Interest Rate
 shall mean a rate of interest per annum, adjusted as necessary, to result in an interest payment equal to the aggregate amount of Company Obligations constituting interest and fees of the Company due under the Credit Agreement on the applicable Interest Payment Date; and (D) 
Record Date
 with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall mean the day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
10
At any time that a bond of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series is surrendered to the Trustee other than in connection with the redemption thereof, in connection with the Trustees enforcement of rights after a completed default under the Mortgage or in connection with the exchange of that bond as provided in Section 1 hereof, such bond shall be cancelled by the Trustee and shall be treated for all intents and purposes as if it has never been issued. In the event that only a portion of a bond of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series is so surrendered, the Trustee shall deliver without charge to the Agent a new bond of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series in an aggregate principal amount equal to the difference between the principal amount of the portion of the bond of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series so surrendered and the principal amount of such bond prior to such surrender.
 
As provided in Section 8.4 of the Credit Agreement, the Agent shall surrender the bonds of 2007 Credit Agreement Series to the Trustee for cancellation when each of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure of the Company have been reduced to zero and all fees and other amounts payable by the Company pursuant to the Credit Agreement with respect to the Company Obligations shall have been duly paid.
 
Section 3.
Pursuant to the right retained by the Company in each supplemental indenture pursuant to which all bonds outstanding as of the date hereof were issued, the Indenture is hereby amended by inserting the following language as Section 115A immediately following current Section 115 of the Indenture:
 
Section 115A. With the consent of the holders of not less than sixty per centum (60%) in principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, or, if the rights of the holders of one or more, but not all, series then outstanding are affected, the consent of the holders of not less than sixty per centum (60%) in aggregate principal amount of the bonds at the time outstanding of all affected series, taken together, and not any other series, the Company, when authorized by a resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of any of the bonds and coupons;
provided, however
, that no such supplemental indenture shall (1) extend the maturity of any of the bonds or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce the amount of the principal thereof, or reduce any premium, payable on the redemption thereof or change the coin or currency in which any bond or interest thereon is payable, without the consent of the holder of each bond so affected, or (2) permit the creation of any lien, not otherwise permitted, prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding, or (3) reduce the aforesaid percentage of the principal amount of bonds the holders of which are required to approve any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the holders of all the bonds then outstanding. For the purposes of this Section, bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture adversely affects or
 
11
 
diminishes the rights of holders thereof against the Company or against its property.
 
Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of bondholders as aforesaid (the instrument or instruments evidencing such consent to be dated within one year of such request), the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 102 of the Indenture and Article Four of the Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 1, 1940, may rely upon, an opinion of counsel as conclusive evidence that any such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by the provisions of this Section.
 
 
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the bondholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
 
The Company and the Trustee, if they so elect, and either before or after such 60% or greater consent has been obtained, may require the holder of any bond consenting to the execution of any such supplemental indenture to submit his bond to the Trustee or to such bank, banker or trust company as may be designated by the Trustee for the purpose, for the notation thereon of the fact that the holder of such bond has consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and in such case such notation, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be made upon all bonds so submitted, and such bonds bearing such notation shall forthwith be returned to the persons entitled thereto. All subsequent holders of bonds bearing such notation shall be deemed to have consented to the execution of such supplemental indenture, and consent, once given or deemed to be given, may not be withdrawn.
 
 
Prior to the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Company shall publish a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, at least once in one daily newspaper of general circulation in each city in which the principal of any of the bonds shall be payable, or, if all bonds outstanding shall be registered bonds without coupons or coupon bonds registered as to principal, such notice shall be sufficiently given if mailed, first class, postage prepaid, and registered if the Company so elects, to each registered holder of bonds at the last address of such holder appearing on the registry books, such publication or mailing, as the case may be, to be made not less than thirty days prior to such execution. Any failure of the Company to give such notice, or, any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
 
12
Section 4. As supplemented and amended by this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and this Supplemental Indenture and all the terms and conditions herein contained shall be deemed a part thereof.
 
Section 5. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, no duties, responsibilities or liabilities are assumed, or shall be construed to be assumed, by the Trustee by reason of this Supplemental Indenture, other than as set forth in the Indenture as heretofore amended and supplemented. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the recitals herein or in the bonds (other than in the authentication certificate of the Trustee), all of which are made by the Company solely.
 
Section 6. This Supplemental Indenture may be executed in several counterparts, and all such counterparts executed and delivered, each as an original, shall constitute but one and the same instrument.
 
Section 7. The Company acknowledges and intends that all advances made to it by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, including future advances whenever hereafter made, shall be a lien from the time this Supplemental Indenture
is recorded, as provided in Section 15-1302(b)(1) of the Illinois Mortgage Foreclosure Law (the Act), 735 ILCS 15-1101, et seq. The amount of the bonds of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series which comprises the principal amount then outstanding of the Obligations under the Credit Agreement constitutes revolving credit indebtedness secured by a mortgage on real property, pursuant to the terms and conditions of 205 ILCS 5/5d from the date of this Supplemental Indenture.
 
Section 8. The Company shall provide the Trustee with copies of the Credit Agreement and any amendments thereto as soon as practicable after such Credit Agreement or amendment is entered into and the Trustee in performing its duties hereunder shall be entitled to rely on the latest copy of the Credit Agreement and any amendments thereto received from the Company. To the extent not identified in the Credit Agreement or amendment, as provided in the preceding sentence, the Company will inform the Trustee of any change in the identity of the Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the notice or instructions received from the Agent pursuant to the Credit Agreement or amendment.

SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE dated as of March 1, 2007 (Supplemental Indenture), made by and between ILLINOIS POWER COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois (the Company), party of the first part, and BNY MIDWEST TRUST COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois, as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois (the Trustee), as Trustee under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of November 1, 1992, hereinafter mentioned, party of the second part;
 
WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered its General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of November 1, 1992 as from time to time amended (the Indenture), to the Trustee, for the security of the Bonds of the Company issued and to be issued thereunder (the Bonds); and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Indenture there were created and authorized by supplemental indentures thereto bearing the following dates, respectively, the Mortgage Bonds of the series issued thereunder and respectively identified opposite such dates:
 
 
 
 
 
2
and
 
WHEREAS, a supplemental indenture with respect to the Bonds of the 2007 Series and the Bonds of the 2012 Series listed above was executed and filed but such Bonds of the 2007 Series and Bonds of the 2012 Series were never issued and a release with respect to such supplemental indenture was subsequently executed and filed; and
 
WHEREAS, the Company has entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of February 9, 2007 (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement) by and among the Company, Central Illinois Light Company, Central Illinois Public Service Company, AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company and CILCORP Inc., as borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent (in such capacity, the Agent) for the Lenders, providing for the making of certain financial accommodations thereunder to the Company, and pursuant to such Credit Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue to the Agent, as evidence of and security for the Obligations (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company (the Company Obligations), a new series of Bonds under the Indenture; and

WHEREAS, all conditions and requirements necessary to make this Supplemental Indenture a valid, binding and legal instrument have been done, performed and fulfilled and the execution and delivery hereof have been in all respects duly authorized;
 
THAT Illinois Power Company, in consideration of the purchase and ownership from time to time of the Bonds and the service by the Trustee, and its successors, under the
 
3
 
Indenture and of One Dollar to it duly paid by the Trustee at or before the ensealing and delivery of these presents, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, hereby covenants and agrees to and with the Trustee and its successors in the trust under the Indenture, for the benefit of those who shall hold the Bonds as follows:
 
 
 
SECTION 1.
  
The Company hereby creates a new series of Bonds to be known as 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds. The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the provisions of, and shall in all respects be subject to, all of the terms, conditions and covenants of the Indenture, as supplemented and modified. The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be issued only to and in the name of the Agent under the Credit Agreement to evidence and secure any and all Company Obligations under the Credit Agreement.
 
The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be dated as of the Interest Payment Date (as defined below) thereof to which interest was paid next preceding the date of issue, unless (a) issued on an Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated as of such issue date, or (b) issued prior to the occurrence of the first Interest Payment Date thereof to which interest was paid, in which event it shall be dated the date of original issuance.
 
The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be issued in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 and shall mature on the Maturity Date (having at any time the meaning such term has at such time under the Credit Agreement) applicable to the Company.
 
The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall bear interest from their date as set forth in the form thereof hereinafter recited. Interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date (defined below), commencing on the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the date of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds. Payment of principal on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be due on the Maturity Date. If the Maturity Date falls on a day which is not a Business Day, as defined below, principal and any interest and/or fees payable by the Company with respect to the Maturity Date will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day.
 
Both the principal of and the interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be payable at the times and in the manner set forth in the form of bond set out herein and in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Trustee, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to principal under the Credit Agreement shall not give rise to an obligation to pay principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds except on the Maturity Date of the Company or upon redemption as provided in this Supplemental Indenture. If at any time any permanent reduction of the
 
 
4
 
Borrower Sublimit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company or the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company shall result in the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds being greater than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure, a payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds in the amount of such excess shall be deemed discharged upon the effectiveness of such permanent reduction. No payment of principal under the Credit Agreement shall reduce the principal amount of the
 
2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds to an amount less than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as such payment made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal of or interest on the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Agent in connection with the Company Obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
 
As used herein, (A) Business Day shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Credit Agreement; (B) Interest Payment Date shall mean each date on which Company Obligations constituting interest and/or fees are due and payable from time to time pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (C) Interest Rate shall mean a rate of interest per annum, adjusted as necessary, to result in an interest payment equal to the aggregate amount of Company Obligations constituting interest and fees of the Company due under the Credit Agreement on the applicable Interest Payment Date; and (D) Record Dat
e
 with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall mean the day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds shall not be assignable or transferable except to a successor Agent appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds
 
are exchangeable by the Registered Owner thereof, in person or by attorney duly authorized, at the principal office or place of business of the Trustee under the Indenture, upon the surrender and cancellation of said bonds and the payment of any stamp tax or other governmental charge, and upon any such exchange a new registered bond or bonds without coupons, of the same series and maturity and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued in exchange theretofore; provided, that the Company shall not be required to
 
5
 
exchange any 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds for a period of ten (10) days next preceding an Interest Payment Date with respect to such bonds.
 
As provided in Section 8.4 of the Credit Agreement, the Agent shall surrender the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds to the Trustee for cancellation when each of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure of the Company have been reduced to zero and all fees and other amounts payable by the Company pursuant to the Credit Agreement with respect to the Company Obligations shall have been duly paid.

ILLINOIS POWER COMPANY, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Illinois (the Company), which term shall include any successor corporation as defined in the Indenture hereinafter referred to, for value received, hereby promises to pay to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent (in such capacity, the Agent) for the Lenders (as defined below) under the Credit Agreement, dated as of February 9, 2007, by and among the Company, Central Illinois Light Company, Central Illinois Public Service Company, AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company and CILCORP Inc., as borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement), or registered assigns, the principal sum of $200,000,000
 
or such lesser principal amount as shall be equal to the amount of the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company outstanding on the Maturity Date (having at any time the meaning such term has at such time under the Credit Agreement) of the Company, but not in excess of the principal amount of this Bond, and to pay interest thereon at the Interest Rate (as defined below) until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment on the Maturity Date or in the event of redemption of this Bond, until the redemption date.
 
 
6
Interest on this Bond shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date (as defined below), commencing on the first Interest Payment Date next succeeding the date of this Bond. If the Maturity Date falls on a day which is not a Business Day, as defined below, principal and any interest and/or fees payable with respect to the Maturity Date will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day. The interest payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 1, 2007, hereinafter referred to, be paid to the person in whose name this Bond (or one or more predecessor bonds) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below); provided, however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date will be payable to the person to whom the principal hereof shall be payable. Should the Company default in the payment of interest (Defaulted Interest), the Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the person in whose name this Bond is registered on the Record Date to be established by the Trustee for payment of such Defaulted Interest. As used herein, (A) Business Day shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Credit Agreement; (B) Interest Payment Date shall mean each date on which Company Obligations constituting interest and/or fees are due and payable from time to time pursuant to the Credit Agreement; (C) Interest Rate shall mean a rate of interest per annum, adjusted as necessary, to result in an interest payment equal to the aggregate amount of Company Obligations constituting interest and fees of the Company due under the Credit Agreement on the applicable Interest Payment Date; and (D) Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date shall mean the day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
Both the principal of and the interest on this Bond shall be payable in immediately available funds at the office or agency of the Trustee, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.
 
This Bond is to be issued and delivered to the Agent in order to evidence and secure the obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement to make payments to the Lenders under the Credit Agreement and to provide the Lenders the benefit of the lien of the Indenture with respect to the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to principal under the Credit Agreement shall not give rise to an obligation to pay principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds except on the Maturity Date of the Company or upon redemption hereof. If at any time any permanent reduction of the Borrower Sublimit (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company or the Borrower Credit Exposure (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of the Company shall result in the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds being greater than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure, a payment obligation with respect to the principal of the 2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds in the amount of such excess shall be deemed discharged upon the effectiveness of such permanent reduction. No payment of principal under the Credit Agreement shall reduce the principal amount of the
 
2007 Credit Agreement Series Bonds to an amount less than the greater of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure.
 
The obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the interest on this Bond shall be fully or partially, as the case may be, satisfied and discharged to the extent that, at the time that any such payment shall be due, the then due interest and/or fees of the
 
7
 
Company under the Credit Agreement shall have been fully or partially paid. Satisfaction of any obligation to the extent that payment is made with respect to the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement means that if any payment is made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement, a corresponding payment obligation with respect to the interest on this Bond shall be deemed discharged in the same amount as such payment made on the interest and/or fees of the Company under the Credit Agreement.
 
The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of and interest on this Bond, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Agent stating (i) that timely payment of principal of or interest on this Bond has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Agent in connection with the Company Obligations pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
 
The Agent shall surrender this Bond to the Trustee when each of the Borrower Sublimit and the Borrower Credit Exposure of the Company have been reduced to zero and all fees and other amounts payable by the Company pursuant to the Credit Agreement with respect to the Company Obligations shall have been duly paid.
 
This Bond shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or become valid or obligatory for any purpose, until the form of certificate endorsed hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of BNY Midwest Trust Company, as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, the Trustee under the Indenture, or a successor trustee thereto under the Indenture (the Trustee).
 
The provisions of this Bond are continued on the reverse hereof and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
