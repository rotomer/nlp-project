ITEM 8.01 Other Events.
Reference is made to Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 13 - Related Party Transactions to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8; Outlook and Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE (UE), Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), CILCORP Inc. (CILCORP), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP) (collectively, the registrants), for a discussion of the process for power procurement for Amerens Illinois utility companies following the expiration of the Illinois electric rate freeze on January 1, 2007, and power supply contracts on December 31, 2006, a discussion of credit rating changes issued in response to potential actions in Illinois that could threaten the financial solvency of CIPS, CILCO and IP and their ability to procure power, and a discussion of the delivery service rate cases filed by Amerens Illinois utility companies with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) in December 2005 and by UE with the Missouri Public Service Commission in July 2006.
On March 12, 2007, Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) downgraded the credit ratings of Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, and IP as set forth in the following table:
 
 
 
-2-
 
In addition, Moodys assigned to CILCORP a corporate family credit rating of Ba1 and a probability of default rating of Ba1. Moodys indicated that the ratings of Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP remain on review for possible further downgrade. Moodys also placed Amerens Prime-2 short-term credit rating for commercial paper on review for possible downgrade. The ratings of UE are no longer on review although the rating outlook is negative.
Moodys indicated that the downgrade of the ratings of Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP was prompted by the passage of rate freeze legislation by both the Illinois House of Representatives on March 6, 2007, and the Environment and Energy Committee of the Illinois Senate on March 7, 2007, and the growing support for a rate freeze in both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly. Moodys indicated that the ratings of Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP are under review for possible future downgrade. In the event of the passage and enactment of rate freeze legislation, Moodys indicated that the Ameren Illinois utilities could be downgraded further into speculative (junk) grade.
Moodys indicated that the downgrade of UE was prompted by higher costs, lower financial metrics and a continued challenging regulatory environment in Missouri. The downgrade also reflects Moodys expectation that Ameren may have to rely more heavily on UE for upstreamed dividends if rate freeze legislation is passed and enacted in Illinois.
As a result of the downgrade by Moodys of CIPS, CILCOs and IPs credit ratings below investment grade (junk) status, these companies delivered a letter to the ICC on March 14, 2007. The letter indicated that the Ameren Illinois utilities would be unable to offer the $20 million one-time customer bill credit intended to assist high-use residential customers that was initially proposed on March 7, 2007. The letter also indicated that the Ameren Illinois utilities would be unable to offer the customer elect phase-in plan, including the recent amendment which would have provided for 0% interest on a deferred portion of customers bills. The Ameren Illinois utilities also notified the ICC that the voluntary $15 million contribution that the utilities intended to make to fund energy assistance and energy efficiency initiatives would not be made as well. The Ameren Illinois utilities took such steps because of the need to marshal their resources to fund ongoing utility operations.
On March 9, 2007, Standard & Poors Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (S&P), issued a report in response to the passage by the Environment and Energy Committee of the Illinois Senate of legislation which would roll back rates to 2006 levels and freeze rates for at least six months. S&P indicated in its report that if such bill was passed by the full Senate, the issuer credit ratings on the Ameren Illinois utilities would be immediately lowered to BB+. According to S&P, such a downgrade would reflect growing sentiment in both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly of the need for rate relief for certain affected customers of the Ameren Illinois utilities. S&P indicated that it would further lower the ratings on the Ameren Illinois utilities if rate freeze legislation of any meaningful length is approved by both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly, and such ratings may be lowered precipitously in such circumstance.
As a result of the downgrade by Moodys of the issuer credit ratings of CIPS, CILCO and IP below investment-grade status, CIPS, CILCO and IP expect that they may be faced with reduced access to capital. The downgrade may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel, power and gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. CIPS, CILCO, and IP may also be required to post collateral or other assurances for

certain trade obligations. In addition, the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower. Suppliers may also request prepayment for products and services.
This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP. Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf. No registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other registrant.
