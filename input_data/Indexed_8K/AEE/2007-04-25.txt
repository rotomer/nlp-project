ITEM 8.01 Other Events.
Reference is made to Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8; Outlook and Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, all in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE (UE), Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco), CILCORP Inc. (CILCORP), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP) (collectively, the registrants), for a discussion of proposed rate freeze legislation in Illinois applicable to CIPS, CILCO and IP (collectively, the Ameren Illinois utilities) and a discussion of credit rating changes issued in response to proposed rate freeze legislation. Reference is also made to the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Ameren and certain of its registrant subsidiaries on March 15, 2007 and April 20, 2007.
On April 23, 2007, Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P) downgraded the credit ratings of the registrants as set forth in the following table:*
 
- 2 -
S&P indicated that the ratings of all of the registrants remain under review for possible further downgrade.
S&P indicated that the downgrade of the registrants was prompted by the passage of legislation in the Illinois Senate on April 20, 2007 that would roll back electric rates to pre-January 2, 2007 levels and freeze rates at those levels for at least one year, as well as require the refunding of revenues collected since January 1, 2007 due to rate increases. S&P noted that, if such legislation is signed into law, it would result in a significant revenue shortfall and materially affect the liquidity of the Ameren Illinois utilities. S&P further stated that the investment grade ratings of Ameren, UE, and Genco assume that if the Ameren Illinois utilities experience significant stand-alone stress, Ameren will not provide material support to the Ameren Illinois utilities. S&P indicated that while a complete rate rollback and freeze would be harmful to Amerens consolidated financial profile, it expects that in such event damage to Ameren, UE, and Genco would be contained and that S&P would likely keep Amerens, UEs, and Gencos corporate credit ratings investment grade.
The registrants expect that they may be faced with reduced access to capital as a result of the downgrades by S&P of the registrants corporate credit ratings. The downgrades may also increase the cost of borrowing and costs of fuel, power and gas supply, among other things, resulting in a negative impact on earnings. The registrants may also be required to post collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations. Suppliers may also request prepayment for products and services.
On April 24, 2007, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") stated its view that the passage of rate freeze legislation by the Illinois Senate was a negative development although it will not have an immediate impact on the credit ratings of Ameren or the Ameren Illinois utilities.  Moody's also stated that any progress toward passage of the legislation by the Illinois House could result in a ratings downgrade of the Ameren Illinois utilities.  Further,  Moody's said that enactment into law of such legislation could result in multi-notch downgrades of the ratings of the Ameren Illinois utilities well into speculative grade due to concerns about the impact on the financial performance of the Ameren Illinois utilities.
