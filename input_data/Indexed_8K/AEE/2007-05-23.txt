ITEM 8.01 Other Events.
Reference is made to Note 3 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8; Outlook under Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, all in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006; and Note 2 - Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part I, Item 1; Outlook under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, all in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2007, of registrant Ameren Corporation and its registrant subsidiary, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE (UE), for a discussion of the rate case filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) by UE in July 2006 which originally requested an increase in base rates for electric service of $361 million. On May 22, 2007, the MoPSC issued an order, effective June 1, 2007, (which is subject to appeal) authorizing approximately a $43 million increase in UEs base rates for electric service based on a return on equity of 10.2%. Under generally accepted accounting principles, UE will conform the accounting for certain expenses, including a reduction in depreciation expense, with the treatment prescribed in the MoPSC rate order. UEs request to utilize a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism was denied, but UEs existing treatment of the December 2005 expiration of a cost-based power supply contract between UE and its affiliate, Electric Energy, Inc. was accepted by the MoPSC. UE continues to evaluate the order.
This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Ameren Corporation and UE (each a registrant). Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf. No registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other registrant.
