FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Aug. 2, 2007Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second quarter 2007 net income of $143 million, or 69 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2006 net income of $123 million, or 60 cents per share.  Net income for the first six months of 2007 was $266 million, or $1.29 per share, compared to $193 million, or 94 cents per share, in the first half of 2006.  Second quarter and first half 2007 earnings were not impacted by the recently announced Illinois rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement. Costs associated with this settlement agreement will be recorded in the companys 2007 third quarter and future periods should recently passed legislation be signed into law by the Governor of Illinois.
 
Our second quarter earnings benefited principally from higher power prices for sales from our non-rate regulated generation business segment and warmer summer weather, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. These benefits were reduced by a planned maintenance and refueling outage at AmerenUEs Callaway nuclear plant, higher fuel costs and increased costs of operating and investing in our utility businesses.
 
Amerens Missouri regulated business segment, which includes AmerenUEs electric and gas utility operations, contributed $66 million to net income in the second quarter of 2007  $12 million less than the year-ago period. This segment contributed $89 million to net income in the first half of 2007  $24 million below the year-ago period. The Illinois regulated business segment, which includes the electric and gas distribution utility businesses of AmerenCIPS, AmerenCILCO and AmerenIP, contributed $19 million to Amerens net income in the second quarter of 2007  $14 million less than the second quarter of 2006. This segment contributed $48 million to net income in the first half of 2007, compared to $42 million in the same period a year ago. Amerens non-rate-regulated electric generation segment contributed $56 million to net income in the second quarter of 2007  $43 million more than the year-ago period. This segment contributed $126 million to net income in the first half of 2007  $86 million more than the year-ago period.
 
 
Add one
 
Amerens earnings in the second quarter of 2007 were favorably affected by higher electric margins in its non-rate-regulated generation business segment due to the replacement of below-market power sales contracts that expired in 2006. Those contracts were replaced with higher-priced, market-based power sales contracts in 2007. Electric margins in Amerens Missouri and Illinois rate-regulated business segments benefited from greater cooling demand caused by warmer summer weather. Cooling degree days increased 12 percent in the second quarter of 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, and were over 30 percent above normal. Increases in fuel and related transportation, labor and benefits, bad debt, depreciation and financing costs reduced the benefit of the higher power prices and warmer weather.
 
Ameren also announced today that it has updated its 2007 non-GAAP earnings guidance. The company now expects non-GAAP 2007 earnings to range between $3.15 and $3.40 per share and GAAP earnings to range between $2.80 and $3.05 per share. The 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes the 9 cents per share negative impact of the severe January 2007 storms; the estimated 26 cents per share negative impact in 2007 of the recent settlement agreement among parties in Illinois to provide comprehensive rate relief and customer assistance; the 5 cents per share positive impact resulting from the reversal of accruals made in 2006 for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency program funding commitments in Illinois; and the 5 cents per share negative impact of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order retroactively adjusting prior years regional transmission organization costs. The earnings guidance range was updated to reflect finalization of rate matters in Missouri and Illinois; lower-than-expected power plant output; increased financing and legal costs; and higher-than-expected operating expenses for the remainder of 2007, including increased utility delivery system reliability spending. Amerens earnings guidance for 2007 assumes normal weather and is subject to, among other things, regulatory and legislative decisions, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, severe storms, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements. The non-GAAP segment earnings contribution guidance given below also excludes the impact of factors discussed above.  Segment guidance reflects single point estimates, but a range of outcomes could occur around each segments earnings.
 
Missouri Regulated Operations
Second quarter 2007 earnings for the Missouri regulated business segment were down, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily because of the planned maintenance and refueling outage at the Callaway nuclear plant and higher fuel costs. Warmer summer weather, reduced

costs associated with the Taum Sauk Plant upper reservoir breach and increased electric margins resulting from the termination of the joint dispatch agreement on December 31, 2006, benefited earnings in the Missouri regulated business segment in the second quarter of 2007, compared to the second quarter of 2006.
 
Full year 2007 non-GAAP net income for the Missouri regulated business segment is now expected to approximate $305 million. Factors significantly impacting 2007 earnings expectations include better-than-expected weather thus far in 2007, increased spending for delivery system reliability improvements, a FERC order that will increase future purchased power costs under a cost-based contract and higher financing costs.  The earnings impact of the Missouri electric and gas rate cases was generally in line with previous earnings guidance.
 
Illinois Regulated Operations
Earnings for the Illinois regulated business segment for the second quarter of 2007 decreased as compared to the same period in 2006 primarily because of increased bad debt expenses caused by significantly higher customer electric bills, increased depreciation and amortization expenses, higher legal costs and higher financing costs resulting from reduced credit ratings and increased borrowings. Warmer summer weather in 2007 benefited earnings in the Illinois regulated business segment.
 
Full year 2007 GAAP earnings for the Illinois regulated business segment are expected to be reduced by approximately $23 million, after taxes, as a result of the recently announced settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive rate relief and customer assistance. After-tax earnings are also expected to be reduced in 2008, 2009 and 2010 by $9 million, $6 million and $1 million, respectively, as a result of this agreement. Rate relief and customer assistance costs will not be recoverable from customers.
 
Full year 2007 non-GAAP net income for the Illinois regulated business segment is now expected to approximate $100 million. The change in expected 2007 earnings is primarily a result of the outcome of the rehearing of a 2006 electric delivery services rate order by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), higher legal costs and higher financing costs as a result of credit rating downgrades and increased borrowings.
 
Non-Rate-Regulated Generation Operations
Second quarter 2007 earnings for Amerens non-rate-regulated generation business segment increased, compared to the year-ago period, because of the replacement of below-market power sales contracts, which expired in 2006, with higher-priced, market-based contracts in 2007.
 
 
 
Add three
 
However, during the second quarter of 2007, the non-rate-regulated generation business segment did experience higher power plant operation and maintenance costs, which offset a portion of the benefits of higher-priced, market-based contracts.
 
Full year 2007 GAAP earnings for the non-rate-regulated generation business segment are expected to be reduced by approximately $31 million, after taxes, as a result of the recent settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive rate relief and customer assistance. Earnings are also expected to be reduced in 2008, 2009 and 2010 by $13 million, $9 million and $1 million, after taxes respectively, as a result of this agreement.
 
Full year 2007 non-GAAP net income for the non-rate-regulated generation business segment is now expected to approximate $275 million. The change in expected 2007 earnings is primarily because of reduced power plant availability and increased operating and maintenance costs.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share excludes the impact of January 2007 severe storms, the reversal of accruals made in 2006 for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency program funding commitments in Illinois, and the March 2007 FERC order. The 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance also excludes the earnings impact of the recent settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive rate relief and customer assistance.
Ameren believes this information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on Amerens results of operations and earnings per share.
