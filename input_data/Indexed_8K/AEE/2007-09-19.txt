ITEM 8.01  Other Events.
Reference is made to Note 2  Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part I, Item 1; Outlook and Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part I, Item 2, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors, in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007, of registrant Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its registrant subsidiaries, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco), CILCORP Inc. (CILCORP), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP) (collectively, the registrants), for a discussion of a settlement agreement reached in July 2007 among key stakeholders in Illinois that addresses the increase in electric rates and the future power procurement process in Illinois. The settlement was subject to enactment of legislation into law, which occurred on August 28, 2007, and was designed to avoid electric rate rollback and freeze legislation applicable to CIPS, CILCO and IP, and a generation tax on Genco, AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company (AERG), a subsidiary of CILCO, and Electric Energy Inc. (EEI).  CIPS, CILCO and IP are collectively referred to herein as the Ameren Illinois utilities.  
As part of the settlement agreement, the Ameren Illinois utilities entered into financial contracts with their affiliate Ameren Energy Marketing Company (Marketing Company) (for the benefit of Genco and AERG) to lock-in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts (MW) annually of their around-the-clock power requirements during the period June 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012, at relevant market prices. These financial contracts do not include capacity, are not load-following products and do not involve the physical delivery of energy. These financial contracts became effective on August 28, 2007, when legislation in connection with the settlement agreement became law. Below are the contracted volumes and prices per megawatthour:
The financial contracts provide that if any one of the following events occurs during their term, the Ameren Illinois utilities and Marketing Company will meet as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days after the date such event occurs, to identify and discuss its effect on the terms and conditions of, and prices under the financial contracts: a) a state tax on electric generation; b) a state or federal tax on and/or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., a carbon tax); or c) if the state of Illinois enacts a law that eliminates retail electric supplier choice for the residential and small commercial customers of the Ameren Illinois utilities.  The financial contracts also provide that if any one of these events occurs, the parties to the financial contracts will negotiate to determine in a commercially reasonable manner whether the affected terms, conditions and prices can be revised so as to preserve the economic benefits of the financial contracts for all parties and to revise the financial contracts accordingly.  In the event the parties to the financial contracts are not able to agree on such revisions, Marketing Company may terminate the financial contracts

by written notice no earlier than 60 days and no later than 90 days after such event occurs, with the termination being effective when notice is given.
 
This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Ameren, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP.  Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf.  No registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other registrant.
