ITEM 8.01  Other Events.
On November 2, 2007, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP) (collectively, the Ameren Illinois Utilities), filed requests with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) seeking approval to increase their electric delivery service rates.  CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to increase their annual revenues from electric delivery service by $31 million, $10 million and $139 million, respectively.  The Ameren Illinois Utilities pledged earlier this year to keep the overall residential electric bill increases to less than 10 percent per year for each utility in their next rate filings.  These filings are consistent with that pledge.  Accordingly, the requested rate increase for IP residential customers is proposed to be capped in the first year of the increase if the amount of the final authorized rate increase exceeds the first year capped rate level.  This rate increase limit could result in approximately $30 million of the requested increase not being phased in until the second year.  The amount of CIPS and CILCOs requested increases did not require inclusion of similar limits as they were within the scope of the pledge.  The electric rate increase requests are based on an 11 percent return on equity, a capital structure composed of 51 to 53 percent equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $2.1 billion, and a test year ended December 31, 2006.
Also on November 2, 2007, CIPS, CILCO and IP filed requests with the ICC seeking approval to change their natural gas delivery service rates.  CIPS and IP requested to increase their annual revenues from natural gas delivery service by $15 million and $56 million, respectively.  CILCO requested to decrease its annual revenues from natural gas delivery service by $4 million.  The natural gas rate change requests are based on an 11 percent return on equity, a capital structure composed of 51 to 53 percent equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $0.9 billion and a test year ended December 31, 2006.
In their filings, the Ameren Illinois Utilities have also requested ICC approval to implement mechanisms that would permit the reconciliation and adjustment of actual bad debt expenses to those established in rates by the ICC for electric and gas customers and the more timely recovery of investments in existing electric distribution plant.  Since general rate adjustment proceedings require up to 11 months in Illinois, these mechanisms would allow current revenues to better match current costs.  In addition, the Ameren Illinois Utilities are seeking approval of a revenue decoupling rate adjustment mechanism as a part of their natural gas delivery service rate change requests.  This mechanism would separate each utilitys fixed cost recovery from the volume of gas it sells by providing a periodic true-up of revenues.  The periodic true-up would result in adjustments to a utilitys ICC-approved tariffs based on increases or decreases in demand for natural gas.
The ICC proceedings relating to the proposed electric and natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months and decisions by the ICC in such proceedings are required by October 2008.  The Ameren Illinois Utilities cannot predict the level of any delivery service rate change the ICC may approve, when any rate change may go into effect, whether any rate adjustment mechanism discussed above will be approved or whether any rate increase that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for the Ameren Illinois Utilities to recover their costs and earn a reasonable return on their investments when the increase goes into effect.  Attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the Ameren Illinois Utilities press release regarding their filings with the ICC.

News Release

For Immediate Release
 
The Ameren Illinois utilities (AmerenCILCO, AmerenCIPS and AmerenIP) today asked the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) to approve new electric and natural gas delivery service rates that would allow the companies to recover present and ongoing costs and continue making infrastructure investments.
Peoria, Springfield, Decatur, Ill. (Nov. 2, 2007) 
 
This additional revenue is essential for the Ameren Illinois utilities to maintain and improve our electric and natural gas infrastructure and fulfill our commitment to deliver energy in a safe, reliable and cost-efficient manner to our customers, said Scott A. Cisel, president and chief executive officer of the Ameren Illinois utilities. Our current level of electric and gas delivery service rates are insufficient to recover our existing costs of providing service to our customers and earn a reasonable return on our investment.
 
The Ameren Illinois utilities plan to spend $900 million to further improve system reliability and make other capital investments through 2010. Customers have asked for enhanced reliability, as their demand for electricity continues to increase.
 
These rate increases are necessary to attract the money needed from investors to make these critical investments in our infrastructure, Cisel said.
 
As filed with the ICC, the request would provide a total of $247 million annually in additional revenue to be used throughout the utilities 43,700-square-mile service territory.  The proposed gas and electric rate changes are not expected to take effect before October 2008.
Add One
Earlier this year, we pledged to keep the overall residential electric bill increases to less than 10 percent for each utility in the next rate filing, Cisel said. Todays filing with the ICC fulfills that promise.
Electric Delivery Service Rates
The requested increase in electric rates was driven by significant increases in the costs of delivering power to electric customers over the levels supported by current rates. In addition, the Ameren Illinois utilities have continued to invest in their electric delivery systems to support growth in demand and to enhance reliability.
 
Since 1997, electricity usage by Ameren Illinois utilities customers has risen by about 11 percent, an increase driven by the greater use of air conditioning, large screen televisions, computers and other electronic devices. The outlook is for continued growth in the use of electricity.
 
To meet this growing demand, the Ameren Illinois utilities anticipate making significant investments in their electric distribution systems between 2008 and 2010. For example, some of these planned expenditures include $450 million for distribution lines, $55 million for line transformers and $110 million to improve substations. To better serve customers, the utilities plan to spend $30 million to purchase automated electric meters and are investigating smart meters and smart grid technologies. The impact of the proposed electric rate increases will vary with each of the Ameren Illinois utilities. In addition, actual bills will vary depending on the amount of electricity each customer uses and when electricity is used.
 
The electric bill for a typical residential electric-gas combination customer who uses 10,000 kilowatt-hours (kWhs) per year, and does not heat with electricity, is expected to change by the following amount:
The bill for a typical all-electric residential customer who uses 18,000 kWhs per year is expected to change by the following amount:
 
Add Two
The estimated increases are based on constant energy supply charges and the newly redesigned electric rates. They also exclude bill mitigation credits and local taxes.
 
Electric delivery service charges are about one-third of a customers bill. In most cases, the largest portion of the bill is the electricity supply charge that the utilities pass through to customers without any markup or profit to the utilities. This is shown on a bill as Electric Supply.
 
The electric rate requests, if approved by the ICC, would provide $180 million in additional annual revenue.
 
AmerenCILCO and AmerenIP were last granted a delivery service rate increase in November 2006; at that time AmerenCIPS customers received a reduction in their delivery rates.
Natural Gas Delivery Service Rates
AmerenCIPS and AmerenCILCO were last granted a natural gas delivery service rate increase in 2003, while AmerenIP was granted a rate increase in 2005. Since the last natural gas delivery service increases, operating costs have increased significantly and infrastructure investments have continued to be made to safely and reliably deliver natural gas to Ameren Illinois utilities customers.
 
From 2008 to 2010, the Ameren Illinois utilities anticipate making significant investments totaling $215 million to enhance the natural gas distribution system, including improvements to the gas storage fields and installation of 260,000 automated natural gas meters to enhance service.
 
The impact of the proposed natural gas delivery rate adjustments will vary with each of the Ameren Illinois utilities.  Actual bills will vary depending on the amount of natural gas each customer uses.
 
The bill for a typical residential natural gas customer who uses 785 therms per year is expected to change by the following amount:
 
Add Three
The estimated changes assume constant natural gas supply charges and exclude local taxes. The actual monthly changes will vary depending on actual monthly usage.
 
Natural gas delivery service charges are about one-third of a customers bill. In most cases, the largest portion of the bill is the actual cost of natural gas. This is shown on a bill as the Gas Charge (PGA). The PGA (purchased gas adjustment) represents the actual cost of the natural gas without any markup or profit to the utilities.
 
The natural gas rate requests, if approved by the ICC, would provide $67 million in additional annual revenue.
 
Additional Rate Information
The Ameren Illinois utilities are seeking to recover their prudent and reasonable costs incurred to operate, maintain and improve the delivery systems and, at the same time, earn a fair return on their investments made in the systems. Consistent with the rate relief legislation, these rate increase requests do not seek to recover any of the costs of the electric rate relief program.
 
In order to recover the actual costs of delivering electricity and natural gas, while continuing to have the ability to make investments to improve our delivery systems, the Ameren Illinois utilities need the additional revenue these rate increases would provide, Cisel said. Unfortunately, the utilities current junk issuer credit ratings make it more difficult and more expensive to borrow the money needed to invest in the system.
 
Key factors behind todays delivery service rate increase requests include:
 
 
 
Add Four
underground aluminum wire is up about 40 percent, copper wire is up about 100 percent and natural gas pipe is up about 55 percent.
