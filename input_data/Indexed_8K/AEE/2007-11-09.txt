FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Nov. 9, 2007Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced third quarter 2007 GAAP net income of $244 million, or $1.18 per share, compared to third quarter 2006 GAAP net income of $293 million, or $1.42 per share.  GAAP net income for the first nine months of 2007 was $510 million, or $2.46 per share, compared to $486 million, or $2.37 per share, in the first nine months of 2006.
 
Excluding unusual items in 2007 and 2006, third quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income was $282 million, or $1.36 per share, compared to third quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income of $312 million, or $1.52 per share.  Non-GAAP net income for the first nine months of 2007 was $567 million, or $2.73 per share, compared to $511 million, or $2.50 per share in the first nine months of 2006.
 
Amerens earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 were reduced by $38 million (after taxes), or 18 cents per share, as a result of costs associated with an Illinois rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement. The impact of these costs on the first nine months of 2007 was reduced because of the reversal of a $10 million charge (after taxes), or 5 cents per share, originally recorded in 2006 related to funding commitments for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency programs. These commitments were terminated in early 2007 and ultimately replaced by the Illinois settlement. Earnings in the first nine months of 2007 were also reduced by $19 million (after taxes), or 9 cents per share, because of restoration costs following severe January ice storms. Earnings in 2006 reflected costs of severe storms of approximately $19 million (after taxes), or 10 cents per share, for the third quarter and approximately $25 million (after taxes), or 13 cents per share, for the first nine months of 2006. Earnings for the first nine months of 2007 were also reduced $10 million (after taxes), or 5 cents per share, as a result of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order retroactively

adjusting prior years regional transmission organization costs. Excluding unusual items in 2006 and 2007, non-GAAP earnings per share were as follows:
 
 
Our 2007 third quarter earnings were lower than the 2006 period primarily because of the Illinois rate relief settlement, changes in our Illinois electric summer rate structure and the rising costs of operating our regulated utility businesses, including increased reliability expenditures, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. These factors more than offset warmer summer weather and higher electric margins from our non-rate-regulated generation business segment. Through the first nine months of operations this year, our Illinois regulated business experienced a significant earnings decline compared to 2006 due to, among other things, our current levels of electric and gas delivery service rates being insufficient to recover our current costs of providing service to our customers and provide a reasonable return on our investments. Our Nov. 2 requests for $247 million in increased electric and gas rates in Illinois are clearly needed in order for us to provide safe and reliable service to our customers, as well as earn a reasonable return on our investments.
 
We understand that increases in energy costs can be difficult for our customers.  In recognition of this, earlier this year, we pledged to keep the overall annual residential electric bill increases in Illinois to less than 10 percent in the first year for each utility in its next rate filing. Our Illinois rate filing fulfills that promise, Rainwater added.
 
While earnings were significantly lower in the Illinois regulated business segment, earnings improved in the Missouri regulated and non-rate-regulated electric generation business segments. Overall, Amerens earnings in the third quarter of 2007 were negatively impacted by increases in fuel and related transportation costs, distribution system reliability expenditures, plant maintenance, labor and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and financing costs. In addition, a change in the summer rate structure for the delivery of electricity in Illinois also reduced earnings compared to the prior-year period. Higher-priced power sales contracts in Amerens non-rate-regulated generation business segment, as well as the June 2007 implementation of the Missouri electric rate order, reduced the negative impact of these items on Amerens earnings. In addition, electric margins in Amerens Missouri and Illinois rate-regulated business segments benefited from greater cooling demand caused by warmer summer weather. Cooling degree days increased

16 percent in the third quarter of 2007, compared to the same period in 2006, and were 30 percent above normal.
 
On November 5, 2007, Ameren reaffirmed its 2007 earnings guidance. The company expects GAAP earnings to range between $2.80 and $3.05 per share and non-GAAP 2007 earnings to range between $3.15 and $3.40 per share. The 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes the 9 cents per share negative impact of the severe January 2007 ice storms; the estimated 26 cents per share negative impact in 2007 of the settlement agreement among parties in Illinois to provide comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance; the 5 cents per share positive impact resulting from the reversal of accruals made in 2006 for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency program funding commitments in Illinois; and the 5 cents per share negative impact of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order retroactively adjusting prior years regional transmission organization costs. Non-GAAP contribution to 2007 net income for Amerens Missouri regulated business segment is expected to be an estimated $310 million; the Illinois regulated business segment is expected to contribute an estimated $90 million; and the non-rate-regulated business segment is expected to contribute an estimated $280 million. Amerens earnings guidance for 2007 assumes normal weather for the balance of 2007 and is subject to, among other things, regulatory and legislative decisions, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, severe storms, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses and other risks and uncertainties outlined in Amerens Forward-looking Statements.
 
Missouri Regulated Operations
 
Amerens Missouri regulated business segment, which includes AmerenUEs electric and gas utility operations, contributed $179 million to GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2007  $37 million more than the year-ago period. This segment contributed $264 million to GAAP net income in the first nine months of 2007  $9 million above the year-ago period.
 
Third quarter 2007 earnings for the Missouri regulated business segment increased, compared to the same period in 2006, primarily due to the impact of the Missouri electric rate order, warmer summer weather, and the lack of severe storms which occurred in the prior-year period. These gains were reduced by higher fuel and purchased power, labor and employee benefits, financing and reliability improvement costs. Severe storms in the third quarter of 2006 reduced earnings in the Missouri regulated business segment for that period by $13 million, after taxes.

On a non-GAAP basis, Amerens Missouri regulated business segment contributed $179 million to net income in the third quarter of 2007  $24 million more than the year-ago period. This segment contributed $288 million to non-GAAP net income in the first nine months of 2007  $14 million above the year-ago period.
 
Illinois Regulated Operations
 
The Illinois regulated business segment, which includes the electric and gas distribution utility businesses of AmerenCIPS, AmerenCILCO and AmerenIP, incurred a GAAP net loss of $9 million in the third quarter of 2007 - a $92 million decrease in earnings compared to the third quarter of 2006. This segment contributed $45 million to GAAP net income in the first nine months of 2007, down from $125 million in the year-ago period.
 
The Illinois regulated business segment incurred a loss for the third quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily because of the new summer rate structure for the delivery of electricity in Illinois. In addition, costs associated with the Illinois rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement reduced earnings from the Illinois regulated segment by $16 million, after taxes. Higher financing costs, resulting from reduced credit ratings and increased borrowings, and increased depreciation and amortization also reduced third quarter 2007 earnings compared to the year-ago period. Severe storms in the third quarter of 2006 reduced earnings in the Illinois regulated business segment by $7 million, after taxes.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, Amerens Illinois regulated business segment contributed $7 million to net income in the third quarter of 2007  $83 million less than the year-ago period. This segment contributed $66 million to non-GAAP net income in the first nine months of 2007  $66 million less than the year-ago period.
 
Non-Rate-Regulated Generation Operations
 
Amerens non-rate-regulated electric generation business segment contributed $73 million to GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2007  $11 million more than the year-ago period. This segment contributed $197 million to GAAP net income in the first nine months of 2007  $95 million more than the year-ago period.
 
Third quarter 2007 earnings for Amerens non-rate-regulated generation business segment increased, compared to the year-ago period, because of the replacement of below-market power sales contracts, which expired in 2006, with higher-priced, market-based contracts in 2007. However, costs associated with the Illinois rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement reduced earnings from the non-rate-regulated business segment by $22 million, after taxes. Higher plant maintenance expenses also reduced 2007 earnings.  In addition, the third

quarter of 2006 included earnings from the sale of emission allowances while no allowance sales were made in the current-year period.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, Amerens non-rate-regulated electric generation business segment contributed $95 million to non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2007  $34 million more than the year-ago period. This segment contributed $209 million to non-GAAP net income in the first nine months of 2007  $108 million above the year-ago period.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. The 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share and 2007 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes the impact of January 2007 severe storms, a March 2007 FERC order that increased regional transmission organization costs, the reversal of accruals made in 2006 for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency program funding commitments in Illinois and the earnings impact of the 2007 settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance. Ameren believes this information enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on Amerens results of operations and earnings per share.
