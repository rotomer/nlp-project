On November 20, 2007, Illinois Power Company, d/b/a AmerenIP (the "Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameren Corporation, issued and sold $250,000,000 principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") with registration rights in a private placement transaction.  The Notes were issued under the Company's Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Indenture").  The Notes will mature on
November 15
, 20

May 15
and
November 15
of each year.  The first such payment will be made on
May 15
, 2008.  The Company may at any time and from time to time redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a make-whole redemption price.  The Company will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay short-term debt.
 
The Notes will be secured by a related series of the Company's mortgage bonds issued and delivered by the Company to the trustee under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of November 1, 1992, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 15, 2007 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (formerly BNY Midwest Trust Company, successor to Harris Trust and Savings Bank), as mortgage trustee (the "Mortgage").  Accordingly, the Notes will be secured ratably with the Company's mortgage bonds in the collateral pledged to secure such bonds.
 
The Indenture contains default provisions relating to failure to make required payments
on any senior secured debt securities of the Company when due and payable (including the Notes), default in the performance or breach of any other covenants of the Company for 60 days after notice and certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.  The Mortgage contains default provisions relating to failure to make required payments on any outstanding mortgage bonds, default in the performance of other covenants for 60 days after notice, certain events in reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership and the occurrence of a default under the Mortgage.
 
If an event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the trustee under the Indenture, or the holders of 33% of the outstanding
senior secured debt securities of the Company (including the Notes)
, may declare the principal and interest on such senior secured debt securities due and payable immediately.  Upon such acceleration, the mortgage bonds securing the Notes and any other mortgage bonds securing senior secured debt securities of the Company will be immediately redeemable upon demand of the trustee, and surrender thereof to the mortgage trustee, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with interest to the redemption date.
 
The Company has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement and/or, under certain circumstances, a shelf registration statement pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the Notes.  If the Company fails to comply with certain obligations under the registration rights agreement, it will be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 0.25% per year on the Notes for the period of non-compliance (plus an additional 0.25% per year from and during any period in which such non-compliance continues for more than 90 days, up to a maximum rate of 0.50% per year).

Exhibit 4.2
 
Company Order
 
November 20, 2007
 
The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.
Two North LaSalle Street, Suite 1020
Chicago, IL  60602
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Application is hereby made to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), under the Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (the "Indenture"), between Illinois Power Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), and the Trustee for the authentication and delivery of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the "Notes"), pursuant to the provisions of Article II of the Indenture. Additional Notes without limitation as to amount, and without the consent of the holders of the then Outstanding Notes, may also be authenticated and delivered in the manner provided in Section 2.05 of the Indenture. All capitalized terms not defined herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the same meaning as used in the Indenture.
 
The Notes will be initially issued pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in the form of Global Notes registered in the name of Cede & Co. (as nominee for The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), New York, New York, which will act as the Depositary for the Global Notes). Pursuant to Section 2.05(c) of the Indenture, the Notes will have the terms set forth in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit A and in the form of definitive Note attached hereto as Exhibit B (which terms are incorporated by reference in this Company Order). The Global Notes shall bear the depository legend in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. The Notes will be issued only in denominations of $1,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
Initially, beneficial interests in the Notes offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) ("QIBs") in reliance upon Rule 144A under the Securities Act will be represented by one or more separate Global Notes (each, a "Rule 144A Global Certificate") registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC and shall include the non-registration and registration rights legends set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. Initially beneficial interests in the Notes offered and sold to purchasers pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will be evidenced by one or more separate temporary Global Notes (each, a "Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate") and will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC for the accounts of The Euroclear System ("Euroclear") or Clearstream Banking, Luxembourg, socit anonyme ("Clearstream") and shall include the Regulation S and registration rights legends set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. Notes offered and sold to institutional "accredited investors" (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) who are not QIBs and who are not purchasers pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will be in definitive form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and shall include the non-registration and registration
rights legends set forth therein. The Trustee and the Company will have no responsibility or liability for any aspect of transfers of beneficial interests in the Notes (which transfers will be conducted pursuant to the customary procedures of DTC), any records of DTC of beneficial interests or any transactions between DTC and its participants or between any such participants and any other beneficial owners or for monitoring, supervising or reviewing of any thereof.
 
Transfers of beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Certificate will be subject to the restrictions on transfer contained in the non-registration legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Prior to the expiration of the period of 40 consecutive days beginning on and including the later of (x) the day on which the offering of the Notes commences and (y) the original issue date of the Notes (the "Distribution Compliance Period"), transfers of beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate will be subject to the restrictions on transfer contained in the Regulation S legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto. At any time after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, upon receipt by the Trustee and the Company of a certificate from Euroclear or Clearstream certifying that it has received certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership of a Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate (or portion thereof) with respect to any Notes to be exchanged, one or more separate permanent Global Notes (each, a "Permanent Regulation S Global Certificate" and, together with each Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate, each, a "Regulation S Global Certificate") shall be duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee as provided in the Indenture, shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and as nominee for DTC, and shall include the registration rights legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto and shall be deposited with the Trustee, as custodian for DTC. The Trustee, as custodian for DTC, shall reflect by endorsement thereon a decrease in the principal amount of the Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate exchanged. Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in any Temporary Regulation S Global Certificate may only be held through Euroclear or Clearstream. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, transfers of beneficial interests in the Permanent Regulation S Global Certificate will not be subject to any restrictions.
 
In connection with any transfer of Notes, the Trustee and the Company shall be under no duty to inquire into, may conclusively presume the correctness of, and shall be fully protected in relying upon the certificates and other information (set forth in the form of definitive Note attached hereto as Exhibit B, for use in connection with the transfer of the Notes in definitive form, or set forth in Exhibit A-1 attached hereto, for use in connection with the transfer of beneficial interests between a Rule 144A Global Certificate and a Regulation S Global Certificate or to a Note in definitive form, or otherwise) received from the Holders and any transferees of any Notes regarding the validity, legality and due authorization of any such transfer, the eligibility of the transferee to receive such Note and any other facts and circumstances related to such transfer. Transfers of beneficial interests between a Rule 144A Global Certificate and a Regulation S Global Certificate, and other transfers relating to beneficial interests in the Notes in global form, shall be reflected by endorsements of the Trustee, as custodian for DTC, on the schedule attached to such certificate.
 
The Company has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated as of November 20, 2007 (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the initial purchasers of the Notes pursuant
to which the Notes that are issued and sold without registration (the "Private Notes") under the Securities Act may be exchanged for Notes that will be registered under the Securities Act and that will otherwise have substantially the same terms as the Private Notes (the "Exchange Notes"), except that such Exchange Notes will be issued in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit A and will bear all customary legends (except for the non-registration, Regulation S and registration rights legends) or, in lieu of such exchange, the Company has agreed to file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Notes (in which case any Notes so resold will be issued in the form of Global Note attached hereto as Exhibit A and bear all customary legends (except for the non-registration, Regulation S and registration rights legends)). The Private Notes will be exchanged for Exchange Notes only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and otherwise in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture. The Private Notes and the Exchange Notes will constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. Exchange Notes shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee at one time or from time to time upon the receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order in principal amounts equal to the principal amounts of the Private Notes surrendered in exchange therefor. In addition, upon the receipt of such Company Order, the Trustee will take such actions as to effectuate the exchange of any Private Notes for Exchange Notes in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement and the Indenture.

This Note is a Global Note in respect of a duly authorized issue of 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES", which term includes any Global Notes representing such Notes) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof, issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000.
 
The Notes will be secured by mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (formerly BNY Midwest Trust Company), as successor trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of mortgage bonds, under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional mortgage bonds may be issued.
 
So long as any of the Notes of this Series are outstanding, the Company will not optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding Mortgage Bonds not subject to the release provisions of the Indenture, and, therefore, the Release Date will not occur.
 
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note of this Series issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
 
Interest on this Note will accrue from and including the Original Issue Date specified above to, but excluding, May 15, 2008, and thereafter, from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
 
Interest payments for this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). If the Maturity Date of this Note or any redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date or such redemption date.
 
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 30 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes of this Series.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY PRICE" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER" means (A) Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Lazard Capital Markets LLC or their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
 
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER QUOTATIONS" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
 
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes of this Series (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes of this Series, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes of this Series, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes of this Series on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes of this Series.
 
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal of and interest on the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture and, upon such declaration, the Trustee shall demand the redemption of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds to the extent provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifications of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

Interest on this Note (other than interest payable at Maturity) shall be paid by check payable in clearinghouse funds to the Holder as its name appears on the register; provided, that if the Trustee receives a written request from any Holder of Notes, the aggregate principal amount of all of which having the same Interest Payment Date as this Note equals or exceeds $10,000,000, on or before the applicable Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, interest on the Note shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank within the continental United States (designated by such Holder in its request or by direct deposit into the account of such Holder designated by such Holder in its request if such account is maintained with the Trustee or any paying agent).
 
REFERENCE IS HEREBY MADE TO THE FURTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS NOTE SET FORTH IN FULL ON THE REVERSE HEREOF, WHICH FURTHER PROVISIONS SHALL FOR ALL PURPOSES HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS IF SET FORTH IN FULL AT THIS PLACE.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof, directly or through an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized officer, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of 6.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES") of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (herein called the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000.
 
The Notes will be secured by mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the General  Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (formerly BNY Midwest Trust Company), as successor trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of mortgage bonds, under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional mortgage bonds may be issued.
 
So long as any of the Notes of this Series are outstanding, the Company will not optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding Mortgage Bonds not subject to the release provisions of the Indenture, and, therefore, the Release Date will not occur.
 
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note of this Series issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
 
Interest on this Note will accrue from and including the Original Issue Date specified above to, but excluding, May 15, 2008, and thereafter, from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be.
 
Interest payments for this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If any Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day (and without
any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). If the Maturity Date of this Note or any redemption date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after the Maturity Date or such redemption date.
 
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 30 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes of this Series.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY PRICE" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
 
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER" means (A) Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. or Lazard Capital Markets LLC or their respective
affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
 
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER QUOTATIONS" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
 
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes of this Series (except for certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes of this Series, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes of this Series, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes of this Series on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes of this Series.
 
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Notes, the principal of and interest on the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture and, upon such declaration, the Trustee shall demand the redemption of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds to the extent provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifications of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
As set forth in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such Notes, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes affected by such Event of Default shall have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the
enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and to provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Note at the times, places and rates and the coin or currency prescribed in the Indenture.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Note register. Upon surrender of this Note for registration or transfer at the corporate trust office of the Trustee or such other office or agency as may be designated by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, or Chicago, Illinois, endorsed by or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Note registrar, duly executed by the Holder hereof or the attorney in fact of such Holder duly authorized in writing, one or more new Notes of this Series of like tenor and of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
The Notes of this Series are issuable only in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes of this Series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this Series of like tenor and of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof.
 
All terms used in this Note that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated herein.

AUTHORIZED SIGNATORY
 
[FORM OF REVERSE OF BOND]
 
This Mortgage Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Mortgage Bonds of the Company (the "Mortgage Bonds") in unlimited aggregate principal amount, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under and equally secured by the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 1, 1992, executed by the Company to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (formerly BNY Midwest Trust Company), as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank (the "Trustee") to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the properties mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security, the rights of registered owners of the Mortgage Bonds and of the Trustee in respect thereof, and the terms and conditions upon which the Mortgage Bonds are, and are to be, secured. The Mortgage Bonds may be issued in series, for various principal sums, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture. This Mortgage Bond is one of a series designated as the Series BB Mortgage Bonds of the Company, unlimited in aggregate principal amount, issued under and secured by the Indenture and described in the Supplemental Indenture dated as of November 15, 2007 (the "Supplemental Indenture of November 15, 2007" ), between the Company and the Trustee, supplemental to the Indenture.
 
This Series BB Mortgage Bond is subject to redemption in accordance with the terms of Article II of the Supplemental Indenture of November 15, 2007.
 
Series BB Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged, the Series BB Mortgage Bonds shall cease to secure in any manner any Senior Notes outstanding under the Senior Note Indenture, and, pursuant to Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture, the Senior Note Trustee shall forthwith deliver the Series BB Mortgage Bonds to the Company for cancellation.
As provided in Section 4.11 of the Senior Note Indenture, from and after the Release Date (as defined in the Senior Note Indenture), the obligations of the Company with respect to the
 
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur, the principal of all Mortgage Bonds at any such time outstanding under the Indenture may be declared or may become due and payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that such declaration may be rescinded under certain circumstances.
The Series BB Mortgage Bonds are not redeemable except on the date, in the principal amount and for the redemption price that correspond to the redemption date for, the principal amount to be redeemed of, and the redemption price for, the Senior Notes, and except as set forth in Section 2 of this Article II.
Section 1.
                                           
 
In the event that the Company redeems any Senior Notes prior to maturity in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Note Indenture, the Senior Note Trustee shall on the same date deliver to the Company the Series BB Mortgage Bonds in principal amount corresponding to the Senior Notes so redeemed, as provided in Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture. The Company agrees to give the Trustee notice of any such redemption of the Senior Notes on or before the date fixed for any such redemption.
 
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Senior Note Indenture (as defined therein) and the acceleration of the Senior Notes, the Series BB Mortgage Bonds shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of a written demand (hereinafter called a "Redemption Demand") from the Senior Note Trustee stating that there has occurred under the Senior Note Indenture both an Event of Default and a declaration of acceleration of payment of principal, accrued interest and premium, if any, on the Senior Notes specifying the last date to which interest on such Senior Notes has been paid (such date being hereinafter referred to as the "Initial Interest Accrual Date") and demanding redemption of the Series BB Mortgage Bonds. The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture. Upon surrender of the Series BB Mortgage Bonds by the Senior Note Trustee to the Trustee, the Series BB Mortgage Bonds shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon from the Initial Interest Accrual Date to the redemption date; provided, however, that in the event of a rescission or annulment of acceleration of the Senior Notes pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 8.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, then any Redemption Demand shall thereby be deemed to be rescinded by the Senior Note Trustee although no such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 2.
                                           
 
The Company hereby exercises the right to obtain the authentication of $250,000,000 principal amount of additional Bonds pursuant to the terms of Section 4.04 of the Indenture, all of which shall be Series BB Mortgage Bonds. The principal amount of the Series BB Mortgage Bonds outstanding from time to time shall always be equal to the principal amount of the Senior Notes which are outstanding from time to time under the Senior Note Indenture and to the extent the Senior Note Trustee holds Series BB Mortgage Bonds in excess of such principal amount, such Series BB Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed cancelled and retired and no longer outstanding under the Indenture.
Section 1.
                                           
Such Series BB Mortgage Bonds may be authenticated and delivered prior to the filing for recordation of this Supplemental Indenture.
Section 2.
                                           
 
For purposes of Section 4.09 of the Senior Note Indenture, the Series BB Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of Senior Notes Mortgage Bonds" in respect of the Senior Notes.
