ITEM 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
   
 
 
Amendments to Credit Agreements
Ameren Corporation (Ameren) previously announced that certain of its subsidiaries had entered into two multi-year committed bank credit facilities, a Credit Agreement dated as of July 14, 2006 (the 2006 Credit Agreement) and a Credit Agreement dated as of February 9, 2007 (the 2007 Credit Agreement, and, together with the 2006 Credit Agreement, the Illinois Credit Agreements). See Current Reports on Form 8-K filed July 18, 2006 and February 13, 2007.
On March 26, 2008, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP and collectively with CIPS and CILCO, the Ameren Illinois Utilities), and the other parties to the Illinois Credit Agreements, including CILCORP Inc., entered into amendments to the Illinois Credit Agreements to delete certain covenants contained in the Illinois Credit Agreements, effective March 26, 2008.  Under the Illinois Credit Agreements, each of CIPS, CILCO and IP were required to reserve future bonding capacity under their respective mortgage indentures (that is, they agreed to forgo the issuance of additional mortgage bonds otherwise permitted under the terms of each mortgage indenture) in amounts specified in the Illinois Credit Agreements.  Under the March 26, 2008 amendments, none of the Ameren Illinois Utilities will thereafter be required to observe this requirement.
For a further description of the Illinois Credit Agreements, see Note 4  Credit Facilities and Liquidity to the financial statements under Part II, Item 8, of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Amendment to Power Supply Agreement
On December 18, 2006, Ameren Energy Marketing Company (Marketing Company) and Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco) entered into a Power Supply Agreement (Genco PSA). Each of Genco and Marketing Company are direct subsidiaries of Ameren Energy Resources Company, LLC and indirect subsidiaries of Ameren.  See the Form 8-K filed by Ameren, CILCORP Inc., CILCO and Genco on December 21, 2006.
On March 28, 2008, Genco and Marketing Company entered into an amendment, effective immediately, of the Genco PSA.  Under the amendment, Genco will be liable to Marketing Company in the event of an unplanned outage or derate (reduction in rated capacity) due to sudden, unanticipated failure or accident within the generating plant site of one or more of its generating units.  Gencos liability in such case will be for the positive difference, if any, between the market price of capacity and/or energy Genco does not deliver and the contract price under the Genco PSA for that capacity and/or energy.  Genco has insurance that covers many but not all of these situations, subject to deductibles and policy limits.  An unplanned outage or derate that continues for one year or more is an event of default under the Genco PSA.
 
 
In the event of Marketing Company
s unexcused failure to receive energy under the Genco PSA, Marketing Company would be required to pay Genco, the positive difference, if any, between the contract price and the price actually received by Genco, acting in
a commercially reasonable manner, to resell the unreceived energy, less any reasonable related transmission, ancillary service, or brokerage costs.

On March 28, 2008, AERG and Marketing Company entered into an amendment, effective immediately, of the AERG PSA.  Under the amendment, AERG will be liable to Marketing Company in the event of an unplanned outage or derate (reduction in rated capacity) due to sudden, unanticipated failure or accident within the generating plant site of one or more of its generating units.  AERGs liability in such case will be for the positive difference, if any, between the market price of capacity and/or energy AERG does not deliver and the contract price under the AERG PSA for that capacity and/or energy.  AERG has insurance that covers many but not all of these situations, subject to deductibles and policy limits.  An unplanned outage or derate that continues for one year or more is an event of default under the AERG PSA.
  In the event of Marketing Company
s unexcused failure to receive energy under the AERG PSA, Marketing Company would be required to pay AERG, the positive difference, if any, between the contract price and t
he price actually received by AERG, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to resell the unreceived energy, less any reasonable related transmission, ancillary service, or brokerage costs.

Exhibit 10.3
 
 
 
This Power Supply Agreement (referred to as the Agreement), entered into this 28th day of March, 2008 by and between Ameren Energy Marketing Company (Buyer), and Ameren Energy Generating Company (Seller), where Buyer and Seller shall be referred to herein collectively as Parties and individually as a Party.
, Seller is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameren Energy Resources Company, LLC and has been authorized to sell power at market-based rates; and
WHEREAS
Buyer is a power marketer that has been authorized to sell power at market-based rates; and
WHEREAS,
Seller has a fleet of coal and gas fired generating units which currently has a total generating capacity of approximately 4,215 MW that operate throughout the states of Missouri and Illinois (Sellers Generation Fleet); and
WHEREAS,
the Buyer desires to obtain rights to the capacity and energy from the Sellers Generation Fleet pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in order to, among other things, sell the capacity and energy into the market using Buyers market-based rate authority; and
WHEREAS,
, the Parties hereto desire to establish herein the terms and conditions under which Buyer shall procure the capacity and energy from Seller throughout the term of this Agreement; and
WHEREAS
, Buyer and Seller entered into a long-term electric power supply agreement dated as of December 18, 2006 (the PSA) in order to meet certain demands of Buyer for capacity and energy; and
WHEREAS
, the Parties desire to amend the PSA to make clear that unplanned outages or derates of one or more units in Sellers Generation Fleet do not excuse Sellers performance under the PSA or this Agreement.
WHEREAS
, in consideration of the premises and provisions of this Agreement and in consideration of the mutual agreements and undertakings of the Parties, the Parties do hereby agree that the terms and provisions of the Articles and Sections shall read in their entirety as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
 
 
-1-
1.1        
Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6, this Agreement shall be effective as of the date set forth above and deliveries commenced January 1, 2007 and shall continue through December 31, 2022 and from year to year thereafter unless either Party elects to terminate by providing the other Party with no less than six (6) months advanced written notice of its desire to terminate.
2.1        
Seller shall sell and deliver and the Buyer shall purchase and receive energy at the high side of each generator bus of the Sellers Generation Fleet (Delivery Point). All energy delivered hereunder shall be metered as three phase, 60 hertz at the high side of the step-up transformer.  The Buyer shall arrange and be responsible for all transmission services and costs relative to the capacity and associated energy Buyer schedules at and from the Delivery Point.
         Title to and risk of loss related to Buyers capacity and associated energy purchased hereunder shall transfer from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point.  Seller warrants that it will deliver to Buyer such capacity and energy free and clear of all liens, security interests, claims and encumbrances or any interest therein or thereto by any person arising prior to the Delivery Point.
2.2
Article III
3.1        
Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase all of the capacity from the Sellers Generation Fleet and such amount of associated energy from Seller, which amounts of capacity and energy shall not be reduced for events other than those described in Section 3.4(d) (Contract Quantity).  Seller also agrees to provide to Buyer, in addition to capacity and energy, ancillary services that Seller has not directly sold to another third party.   Before any of its ancillary services are sold to a third party, Seller shall consult with Buyer and shall offer to sell to Buyer any such ancillary services.  Buyer and Seller shall discuss the appropriate charges and billing procedures for such ancillary services, and if necessary shall amend this agreement accordingly.
For planning purposes, sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of each calendar year during the term of this Agreement or at such other times as may be appropriate, the Parties shall determine in accordance with Section 3.3 below the total MW of capacity and energy which Seller anticipates the Sellers Generation Fleet shall be capable of providing (Net Generation Capability) during the next succeeding calendar year or during the time period remaining until the next determination of Net Generation Capability.  Should the Parties fail to agree to a reasonable value for the Net Generation Capability for the next succeeding calendar year, the prior years determination shall be used.
3.2        
 
 
-2-
         In determining the Net Generation Capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet,the Parties shall review the actual performance experience of the Sellers Generation Fleet for the past calendar year and determine by mutual agreement a reasonable value for the Net Generation Capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet for the next succeeding calendar year or during the time period remaining until the next calendar year determination. The Parties shall give due consideration to pollution control restrictions, the effect of any outage time required for expected replacements, extensions, and improvements or major maintenance of an unusual nature which is in excess of four weeks duration which would affect the daily capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet and any other factors as may be reasonably determined by the Parties to have an impact on the Net Generation Capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet.
3.3
 
         Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties,the scheduling of energy shall be in accordance with the following:
3.4
 
 (a)        Seller shall provide to Buyer notice of the amount of hourly capacity it has available (Hourly Available Capacity) to sell for next day delivery during a morning generation conference call which will be held at 0700 CPT each day.  Seller shall provide such prior notice to Buyer so that Buyer may schedule the generation into the MISO Day Ahead (DA) market (which currently closes at 1100 EST) or into another market on the business day prior to the next delivery day that quantity of associated energy Buyer needs to sell into the applicable market for next day delivery.   Seller should also provide, via an electronic means made available by the Buyer, the Hourly Available Capacity to the Buyer by 0800 CPT.  Further, the Seller shall make all efforts to immediately notify the Buyer prior to the close of the MISO DA market as to changes following the 0800 CPT electronic declaration that will affect the next day deliverability so the Buyer may update the next day schedule.
 
 
(b)          Seller shall immediately notify Buyer via a phone call of any change in the amount of capacity it has available on an intra-day basis so that Buyer may adjust Buyers energy schedule accordingly for  both the current and next hour delivery. 
(c)          In addition to the quantity of energy Seller indicated would be available to Buyer for next day delivery, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule, no later than  thirty  minutes prior to the start of the next clock hour, that quantity of additional energy that Seller timely indicates to Buyer will become available for next hour delivery.   
(d)          All energy shall be scheduled for delivery in whole megawatts. Seller shall be excused from its obligation to deliver and shall not be obligated to operate any unit or units within the Sellers Generation fleet for delivery of energy hereunder where the amount of energy scheduled by Buyer would have to be delivered by operating one or more of the units in the Sellers Generation Fleet at or below the minimum run requirement for such unit or units (Minimum Run Requirement).  Seller shall provide reasonable notice to Buyer when Buyer fails to schedule a sufficient amount of energy to satisfy the Minimum Run Requirement.
 
 
-3-
For each MWh of associated energy delivered by Seller and purchased by Buyer during the month of delivery, Buyer shall pay an Energy Charge equal to the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:
4.1   
  
Energy Charge:  
 
Energy Charge = (Buyers Monthly Net Revenues  Monthly Capacity Charge) / Total Energy Purchased by Buyer
Where:
Buyers Monthly Net Revenues = Buyers Total Revenues less Buyers Expenses and Elgin Gross Revenues.
Buyers Total Revenues = Buyers gross revenues less any gross revenues associated with activities not supported in whole or in part by Sellers generation or the generation owned and operated by AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company (AERG).
Buyers Expenses = All administrative and general, transmission, purchased power or other expenses less those expenses not supporting in whole or in part the gross revenues associated with Sellers generation or the generation owned and operated by AERG.

Buyer shall also pay a Monthly Capacity Charge, which shall be calculated in accordance with Attachment A.  If accounting information is not available to exactly determine the Monthly Capacity Charge by the invoicing deadline for a given month, the Monthly Capacity charge will be estimated in a commercially reasonable manner and adjusted to actual on the following months invoice.
4.2         
Monthly Capacity Charge:  
          By the twentieth business day of the month immediately following the month of service, Seller shall render to Buyer an invoice indicating the Energy Charge and the Monthly Capacity Charge for such month of delivery and any credit or assessment to reflect any adjustment needed to rectify differences between the estimated Monthly Capacity Charge and the actual Monthly Capacity Charge for prior months of delivery.  Buyer shall make payment promptly upon the receipt of such statement, and, in any event, no later than the 25 day of the month in which such invoice is rendered, provided, however, such due date shall be extended by the number of days Seller is late in rendering the invoice.

percent of accuracy, no correction shall be made in billings; but if any test shows that the meter is inaccurate by more than 1 percent, a correction shall be made in the billing for one-half the elapsed period since the last test was made.  The cost of any additional test requested by Buyer shall be borne by Buyer if such test shows the meter to be within 1 percent of accuracy, and by Seller if such test shows it to be inaccurate by more than 1 percent.
          The Parties recognize that there may be some units within the Sellers Generation Fleet that operate primarily during the months of April through October of each year.  The Parties further recognize that additional costs may be incurred in order to commence operations of certain units during the winter season after cessation of operations for a time, and that certain modifications to such units such as installation of inlet air de-icing equipment may be needed.  Upon Buyers request, Seller shall provide Buyer an estimate of such additional costs for the modifications necessary for winter operations. Should Buyer agree to incur the additional costs and/or to pay the costs for necessary modification, Seller shall make such necessary modifications.  The additional fixed costs of such modifications upon their completion shall be included in Monthly Capacity Charge.
6.2
Winter Operations:  
            Seller and Buyer shall appoint one or more members to an Operating Committee, which shall have the authority to establish normal system control procedures, and to act in matters relating to the sale and purchase of capacity and energy under this Agreement, in addition to specific authority set out elsewhere in this Agreement.

          As used in this Agreement, an Event of Force Majeure means an event or circumstances which prevents one Party (the Claiming Party) from performing its obligations or causes delay in the Claiming Partys performance under this Agreement, which event is beyond the reasonable control of, and is not the result of the negligence of the Claiming Party, and which, even with the exercise of due diligence or use of good utility practice, the Claiming Party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided, such as, but not limited to acts of God; fire; flood; earthquake; tornado; named storms; any natural disaster; war; riots; sabotage; computer virus; terrorism; insurrection, strike; labor dispute; unavailability of labor; civil disorder; requirements, actions or failure to act on the part of governmental authorities; adoption or change in any law, regulation, statute, rule or regulation imposed by federal, state or local governmental bodies, including, without limitation, a change in the interpretation thereof; or any lawful order by any court or administrative agency; loss of supply of generating inputs, including fuel and cooling water.  An unplanned outage or derate of one or more units in Sellers Generation Fleet due to sudden, unanticipated failure or accident within the generating plant site (an Unplanned Event) shall not constitute an Event of Force Majeure.
7.1
Force Majeure Definition:  
          Except for obligations to make any payments under this Agreement, the Parties shall be excused from performing their respective obligations if and to the extent that they are unable to so perform orare prevented from performing by a Force Majeure, provided that (1)  the non-performing Party, as promptly as practicable after the Party reasonably determines that a Force Majeure event has occurred, gives the other Party written notice describing the particulars of the occurrence;(2) the suspension of performance is of no greater scope and of no longer duration than is reasonably required by the Force Majeure; (3) the non-performing Party uses due diligence to remedy its inability to perform; and (4) as soon as the non-performing Party is able to resume performance of its obligations excused as a result of the occurrence, it gives prompt written notification thereof to the other Parties.

7.2A       Remedies for Failure to Deliver or Receive
(a)In the event of Sellers unexcused failure to deliver the Contract Quantity of capacity and energy pursuant to this Agreement, including but not limited to the occurrence of an Unplanned Event, Seller shall pay Buyer, as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy the positive difference, if any, between the Replacement Price and the Contract Price.  For purposes of this paragraph (a), Contract Price means the price to be paid by Buyer under this Agreement for the energy and/or capacity that was not delivered by Seller, and Replacement Price means the price actually paid by Buyer, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to replace the undelivered energy and/or capacity, plus any reasonable related transmission, ancillary service, or brokerage costs, or at Buyers option, the market price at the Delivery Point for such energy and/or capacity not delivered as determined by Buyer in a commercially reasonable manner; provided, however, in no event shall such price include any penalties, ratcheted demand or similar charges, nor shall Buyer be required to utilize or change its utilization of its owned or controlled assets or market positions to minimize Sellers liability.  For purposes of this definition of Replacement Price, Buyer shall be considered to have replaced the undelivered energy and/or capacity to the extent Buyer shall have entered into one or more arrangements in a
   
 
 
-7-
 
 commercially reasonable manner whereby Buyer repurchases its obligation to sell and deliver the energy and/or capacity to another party.
(b)In the event of Buyers unexcused failure to receive the Contract Quantity of energy pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall pay Seller, as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy, the positive difference, if any, between the Contract Price and the Sales Price.  For purposes of this subparagraph (b), Sales Price means the price actually received by Seller, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to resell the unreceived energy, less any reasonable related transmission, ancillary service, or brokerage costs, and Contract Price means the price to be paid by Buyer under this Agreement for the energy and/or capacity that was not received by Buyer.
   
  If either Party (X) has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party's (Y) creditworthiness or performance under this Agreement has become unsatisfactory, X may provide Y with written notice requesting Performance Assurance in an amount determined by X in a commercially reasonable manner. Upon receipt of such notice, Y shall have three (3) Business Days to remedy the situation by providing Performance Assurance to X. Failure of Y to provide Performance Assurance, or a guaranty or other credit assurance, acceptable to X within three (3) Business Days after written notice shall constitute an Event of Default under the Agreement. Performance Assurance means collateral in the form of either cash, Letter(s) of Credit, or other security acceptable to the requesting Party. Letter(s) of Credit means one or more irrevocable, transferable standby letters of credit issued by a U.S. commercial bank or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch with such bank having a credit rating of at least A- from the Standard & Poors Rating Group or A3 from Moodys Investor Services, Inc.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.6, this Agreement shall be effective as of the date set forth above and deliveries commenced January 1, 2007 and shall continue through December 31, 2022 and from year to year thereafter unless either Party elects to terminate by providing the other Party with no less than six (6) months advanced written notice of its desire to terminate.
2.1         
Seller shall sell and deliver and the Buyer shall purchase and receive energy at the high side of each generator bus of the Sellers Generation Fleet (Delivery Point). All energy delivered hereunder shall be metered as three phase, 60 hertz at the high side of the step-up transformer.  The Buyer shall arrange and be responsible for all transmission services and costs relative to the capacity and associated energy Buyer schedules at and from the Delivery Point.
         Title to and risk of loss related to Buyers capacity and associated energy purchased hereunder shall transfer from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point.  Seller warrants that it will deliver to Buyer such capacity and energy free and clear of all liens, security interests, claims and encumbrances or any interest therein or thereto by any person arising prior to the Delivery Point.
2.2
Article III
3.1         
Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to purchase all of the capacity from the Sellers Generation Fleet and such amount of associated energy from Seller, which amounts of capacity and energy shall not be reduced for events other than those described in Section 3.4(d) (Contract Quantity).  Seller also agrees to provide to Buyer, in addition to capacity and energy, ancillary services that Seller has not directly sold to another third party.  Before any of its ancillary services are sold to a third party, Seller shall consult with Buyer and shall offer to sell to Buyer any such ancillary services.  Buyer and Seller shall discuss the appropriate charges and billing procedures for such ancillary services, and if necessary shall amend this agreement accordingly.
         For planning purposes, sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of each calendar year during the term of this Agreement or at such other times as may be appropriate, the Parties shall determine in accordance with Section 3.3 below the total MW of capacity and energy which Seller anticipates the Sellers Generation Fleet shall be capable of providing (Net Generation Capability) during the next succeeding calendar year or during the time period remaining until the next determination of Net Generation Capability.  Should the Parties fail to agree to a reasonable value for the Net Generation Capability for the next succeeding calendar year, the prior years determination shall be used.
3.2
 
 
-2-
In determining the Net Generation Capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet,the Parties shall review the actual performance experience of the Sellers Generation Fleet for the past calendar year and determine by mutual agreement a reasonable value for the Net Generation Capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet for the next succeeding calendar year or during the time period remaining until the next calendar year determination. The Parties shall give due consideration to pollution control restrictions, the effect of any outage time required for expected replacements, extensions, and improvements or major maintenance of an unusual nature which is in excess of four weeks duration which would affect the daily capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet and any other factors as may be reasonably determined by the Parties to have an impact on the Net Generation Capability of the Sellers Generation Fleet.
3.3         
 
Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties,the scheduling of energy shall be in accordance with the following:
3.4        
 
(a)          Seller shall provide to Buyer notice of the amount of hourly capacity it has available (Hourly Available Capacity) to sell for next day delivery during a morning generation conference call which will be held at 0700 CPT each day.  Seller shall provide such prior notice to Buyer so that Buyer may schedule the generation into the MISO Day Ahead (DA) market (which currently closes at 1100 EST) or into another market on the business day prior to the next delivery day that quantity of associated energy Buyer needs to sell into the applicable market for next day delivery.  Seller should also provide, via an electronic means made available by the Buyer, the Hourly Available Capacity to the Buyer by 0800 CPT.  Further, the Seller shall make all efforts to immediately notify the Buyer prior to the closing of the MISO DA market as to changes following the 0800 CPT electronic declaration that will affect the next day deliverability so the Buyer may update the next day schedule.
 
(b)          Seller shall immediately notify Buyer via a phone call of any change in the amount of capacity it has available on an intra-day basis so that Buyer may adjust Buyers energy schedule accordingly for  both the current and next hour delivery. 
(c)          In addition to the quantity of energy Seller indicated would be available to Buyer for next day delivery, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule, no later than  thirty  minutes prior to the start of the next clock hour, that quantity of additional energy that Seller timely indicates to Buyer will become available for next hour delivery.
(d)          All energy shall be scheduled for delivery in whole megawatts.  Seller shall be excused from its obligation to deliver and shall not be obligated to operate any unit or units within the Sellers Generation fleet for delivery of energy hereunder where the amount of energy scheduled by Buyer would have to be delivered by operating one or more of the units in the Sellers Generation Fleet at or below the minimum run requirement for such unit or units (Minimum Run Requirement).  Seller shall provide reasonable notice to Buyer when Buyer fails to schedule a sufficient amount of energy to satisfy the Minimum Run Requirement.
 
 
-3-
For each MWh of associated energy delivered by Seller and purchased by Buyer during the month of delivery, Buyer shall pay an Energy Charge equal to the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:
4.1         
Energy Charge:  
Energy Charge = (Buyers Monthly Net Revenues  Monthly Capacity Charge) / Total Energy Purchased by Buyer
Where:
Buyers Monthly Net Revenues = Buyers Total Revenues less Buyers Expenses and Elgin Gross Revenues.
Buyers Total Revenues = Buyers gross revenues less any gross revenues associated with activities not supported in whole or in part by Sellers generation or the   generation owned and operated by Ameren Energy Generating Company (AEG).

supply of generating inputs, including fuel and cooling water.    An unplanned outage or derate of one or more units in Sellers Generation Fleet due to sudden, unanticipated failure or accident within the generating plant site (an Unplanned Event) shall not constitute an Event of Force Majeure.
         Except for obligations to make any payments under this Agreement, the Parties shall be excused from performing their respective obligations if and to the extent that they are unable to so perform orare prevented from performing by a Force Majeure, provided that (1)  the non-performing Party, as promptly as practicable after the Party reasonably determines that a Force Majeure event has occurred, gives the other Party written notice describing the particulars of the occurrence;(2) the suspension of performance is of no greater scope and of no longer duration than is reasonably required by the Force Majeure; (3) the non-performing Party uses due diligence to remedy its inability to perform; and (4) as soon as the non-performing Party is able to resume performance of its obligations excused as a result of the occurrence, it gives prompt written notification thereof to the other Parties.

For purposes of this paragraph (a), Contract Price means the price to be paid by Buyer under this Agreement for the energy and/or capacity that was not delivered by Seller, and Replacement Price means the price actually paid by Buyer, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to replace the undelivered energy and/or capacity, plus any reasonable related transmission, ancillary service, or brokerage costs, or at Buyers option, the market price at the Delivery Point for such energy and/or capacity not delivered as determined by Buyer in a commercially reasonable manner; provided, however, in no event shall such price include any penalties, ratcheted demand or similar charges, nor shall Buyer be required to utilize or change its utilization of its owned or controlled assets or market positions to minimize Sellers liability.  For purposes of this definition of Replacement Price, Buyer shall be considered to have replaced the undelivered energy and/or capacity to the extent Buyer shall have entered into one or more arrangements in a commercially reasonable manner whereby Buyer repurchases its obligation to sell and deliver the energy and/or capacity to another party.
(b)          In the event of Buyers unexcused failure to receive the Contract Quantity of energy pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall pay Seller, as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy, the positive difference, if any, between the Contract Price and the Sales Price.  For purposes of this subparagraph (b), Sales Price means the price actually received by Seller, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, to resell the unreceived energy, less any reasonable related transmission, ancillary service, or brokerage costs, and Contract Price means the price to be paid by Buyer under this Agreement for the energy and/or capacity that was not received by Buyer.
