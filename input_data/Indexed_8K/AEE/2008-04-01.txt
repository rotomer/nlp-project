ITEM 8.01  Other Events.
Reference is made to Note 2  Rate and Regulatory Matters to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 of registrant Ameren Corporation and its registrant subsidiaries, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), CILCORP Inc., Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP), for a discussion of electric and natural gas delivery service rate cases filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) in November 2007 by CIPS, CILCO and IP (collectively, the Ameren Illinois Utilities).  CIPS, CILCO and IP filed requests to increase their annual revenues for electric delivery service by $180 million in the aggregate (CIPS - $31 million, CILCO - $10 million, and IP - $139 million) and to increase their annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $67 million in the aggregate (CIPS - $15 million, CILCO - $4 million decrease and IP - $56 million).
On March 14, 2008, the ICC staff filed direct testimony recommending a net increase in revenues for electric delivery service for the Ameren Illinois Utilities aggregating $38 million (CIPS - $2 million decrease, CILCO - $12 million decrease and IP - $52 million increase) and a net increase in revenues for natural gas delivery service aggregating $9 million (CIPS - $3 million increase, CILCO - $14 million decrease and IP - $20 million increase).  The ICC staff in their direct testimony also opposed the Ameren Illinois Utilities requests to implement cost recovery mechanisms for bad debt expenses and electric infrastructure investments that are being proposed to reduce regulatory lag.  In their direct testimony, the ICC Staff offered limited support for the Ameren Illinois Utilities request to implement a rate adjustment mechanism for the decoupling of natural gas revenues from sales volumes.  Other parties also made recommendations through direct testimony in the rate cases.

The ICC proceedings relating to the proposed electric and natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, and decisions by the ICC in such proceedings are required by the end of September 2008.  The Ameren Illinois Utilities cannot predict the level of any delivery service rate change the ICC may approve, when any rate change may go into effect, whether any rate adjustment mechanism will be approved, or whether any increase eventually approved will be sufficient for the Ameren Illinois Utilities to recover their costs and earn a reasonable return on their investments when the increase goes into effect.
 
This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Ameren, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO and IP.  Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf.  No registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other registrant.
