ITEM 8.01  Other Events.
On April 4, 2008, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE (UE), issued a press release announcing that it was filing on April 4 a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC) seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service by $251 million.  The electric rate increase request will be based on a 10.9 percent return on equity, a capital structure composed of 51 percent equity, a rate base of $5.9 billion, and a test year ended March 31, 2008 with updates for known and measurable changes through June 30, 2008.  In its filing, UE will also request MoPSC approval to implement a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism.
The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months and a decision by the MoPSC in such proceeding is required by March 2009.  UE cannot predict the level of any electric service rate change the MoPSC may approve, when any rate change may go into effect, whether the fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism will be approved, or whether any rate increase that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for UE to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the increase goes into effect.  Attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference is UEs press release regarding its filing with the MoPSC.
