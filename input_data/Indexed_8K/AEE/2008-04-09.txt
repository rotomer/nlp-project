Item 2.03.  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On April 9, 2008, Ameren Energy Generating Company, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation ("Ameren"), issued and sold $300,000,000 principal amount of its 7.00% Senior Notes due 2018 (the "Notes") with registration rights in a private placement transaction.  The Notes were issued under Genco's Indenture dated as of November 1, 2000 (the "Indenture") between Genco and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as amended and supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 1, 2008, between Genco and the trustee (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture").  The Notes will mature on April 15, 2018.  Genco will pay interest on the Notes on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2008.  Genco may at any time and from time to time redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a make-whole redemption price.  Genco will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay outstanding short-term debt (consisting of borrowings under its credit facility and/or the Ameren non-state regulated subsidiary money pool) incurred to finance capital expenditures and to fund other corporate requirements and for other general corporate purposes.  On April 4, 2008, Ameren issued a press release announcing the offering and issuance of the Notes.  A copy of the press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The Indenture contains default provisions including, among other things, Genco's failure to make required payments on any senior debt securities of Genco when due and payable (including the Notes), Genco's failure in the performance of any other covenants of Genco under the Indenture for 30 days after notice, certain events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, a cross-default provision in respect of Genco indebtedness exceeding $25 million and Genco not receiving payments in excess of $25 million due to it under the power supply agreement between Genco and Ameren Energy Marketing Company within 60 days of when they are due.  If an event of default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the trustee under the Indenture, or the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding senior debt securities thereunder (including the Notes), may declare the principal and interest thereon due and payable immediately.
 
The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, which are filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  Genco offered and sold the Notes to the initial purchasers of the Notes in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The initial purchasers then sold the Notes to "qualified institutional buyers" pursuant to the exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act.  Under the terms of a registration rights agreement between Genco and the initial purchasers, Genco has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow holders to exchange the Notes for a new issue of substantially identical senior debt securities that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  In addition, Genco has agreed to file, under specified circumstances, a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the Notes.  If Genco fails to comply with certain obligations under the registration rights agreement, it will be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 0.25% per year on the Notes for the period of noncompliance (plus an additional 0.25% per year from and during any period in which such noncompliance continues for more than 90 days, up to a maximum rate of 0.50% per year).

WHEREAS, all action on the part of the Issuer necessary to authorize the issuance of said Securities under the Original Indenture and this Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the Original Indenture, as supplemented by this Fifth Supplemental Indenture, being hereinafter called the "Indenture") has been duly taken; and
 
WHEREAS, all acts and things necessary to make said Securities, when executed by the Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee as provided in the Original Indenture, the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer, and to constitute these presents a valid and binding supplemental indenture according to its terms, have been done and performed, and the execution of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture and the creation and issuance under the Indenture of said Securities have in all respects been duly authorized, and the Issuer, in the exercise of the legal right and power vested in it, executes this Fifth Supplemental Indenture and proposes to create, execute, issue and deliver said Securities;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in order to establish the designation, form, terms and provisions of, and to authorize the authentication and delivery of, said Securities, and in consideration of the acceptance of said Securities by the holders thereof and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
 
 
DEFINITIONS
 
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.
 
 
 
.  (a)  There is hereby created one (1) series of Securities designated:  7.00% Senior Notes, Series G due 2018, in the initial aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 (the "Series G Senior Notes").  Upon delivery of a written order to the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1 of the Original Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the Series G Senior Notes.  Such written order shall specify the amount of the Series G Senior Notes to be authenticated and the date on which such Series G Senior Notes are to be authenticated.
Section 2.1
          
Terms of 7.00% Senior Notes, Series G due 2018
 
The Series G Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto.
(b)
          
 
.
Section 2.2
          
Terms of Series G Senior Notes Issued Hereunder in Global Form
 
So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or Holder of a Global Security, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Holder of the Series G Senior Notes represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the Original Indenture and under the Series G Senior Notes.  No beneficial owner of an interest in a Global Security will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC's applicable procedures unless the Issuer shall issue certificates for the Series G Senior Notes in definitive registered form.
(a)
          
 
All payments of the principal of, and interest and additional interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Security will be made to DTC or its nominees, as the registered owners thereof.
(b)
          
 
Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds.
(c)
          
 
Certificated definitive Series G Senior Notes may be in denominations of less than $100,000 to the extent any redemption has reduced such Holder's aggregate holding of such Series G Senior Notes to less than $100,000.
(d)
          
 
If any redemption affecting the Series G Senior Notes would result in the amount to be paid to a Holder of such affected Senior Note in respect of such redemption not to equal $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, the Issuer shall instruct the Trustee to round the amount to be paid to such Holder to the nearest $1,000 so that the amount to be paid to such Holder equals $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof.
(e)
          
 
Beneficial interests in a Global Security (and any Series G Senior Notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the Original Indenture and as set forth on the form of such Global Security.  Exhibit B, as referred to in Section 2.4 of the Original Indenture, and Exhibits C, D, E and F, as referred to in Section 2.6 of the Original Indenture, are attached hereto as Exhibits B, C, D, E and F, respectively.
(f)
           
 
Except in the limited circumstances described under Section 2.2(h) below, beneficial interests in a Global Security will only be recorded by book-entry, and owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificates representing Series G Senior Notes.
(g)
          
 
If (i) DTC or any successor depository notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a depository for a Global Security or ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days of such notice, (ii) an Event of Default under the Series G Senior Notes has occurred and is continuing and payment of principal and interest has been accelerated or (iii) the Issuer decides, at its option, to discontinue use of the book-entry system through DTC, then the Issuer shall issue certificates for the Series G Senior Notes in definitive registered form substantially in the form attached hereto in exchange for the Global Security outstanding.
(h)
          
 
The holder of a certificated definitive registered Series G Senior Note may transfer such Series G Senior Note in whole or in part by surrendering it at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and such Series G Senior Note.  Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of definitive Series G Senior Notes, the Issuer will deliver only definitive Series G Senior Notes that bear a restrictive legend unless there is delivered to the Issuer such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably be required by the Issuer, that neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act.
(i)
           
 
.  The Series G Senior Notes shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding from the date of authentication thereof until such amount is paid in full at the rate of interest set forth in the form of such Series G Senior Note attached hereto.  The principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes shall be due and payable at maturity as set forth in the form of Series G Senior Note attached hereto.
Section 2.3
          
Interest, Principal, Maturity Date and Regular Record Date
 
Payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Series G Senior Notes shall be made as provided in Sections 2.4, 2.10, 3.2 and 3.4 of the Original Indenture, except that the final payment of principal of the Series G Senior Notes shall be made on the due date therefor to the account of the Holder as such account shall appear in the Security Register, which amount shall be payable upon presentation and surrender of such Series G Senior Note at the office of the Issuer.
 
The Series G Senior Notes shall mature on the date and in the amounts set forth thereon.
 
The record date applicable to the Series G Senior Notes issued hereunder shall be as set forth in the form of Series G Senior Note attached hereto.
 
All payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to certificated Series G Senior Notes will be made by bank check mailed on the interest payment date to the address of such Holder on the Security Register or, for Holders of at least U.S. $1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Series G Senior Notes, by wire transfer on the interest payment date of immediately available funds to a dollar account maintained by such Holder with a bank or other financial institution; that a written request from such Holder to such effect designating such account is received by the Trustee and the Issuer or the paying agent no later than the record date immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.  Unless such designation is revoked, any such designation made by such person with respect to such certificated Series G Senior Notes will remain in effect with respect to any future payments with respect to such certificated Senior Note payable to such person.
provided
 
.  The Series G Senior Notes issued hereunder are subject to optional redemption, in whole or in part, at any time at the option of the Issuer at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the Series G Senior Notes being so redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption (the "Determination Date") together with the Applicable Premium applicable thereto.
Section 2.4
          
Optional Redemption
 
.  The Issuer, from time to time, without the consent of the Holders of the Series G Senior Notes, may reopen the Series G Senior Notes and create and issue further senior debt securities under the Indenture having the same terms and conditions (including the same CUSIP number) as the Series G Senior Notes issued hereunder in all respects, except for the date of original issuance, the initial interest payment date and the offering price.  Such additional senior debt securities shall be consolidated with, and form a single series with, the previously outstanding Series G Senior Notes hereunder.

the yield to maturity calculated as of a date not more than five days prior to the Determination Date for the United States Treasury security having an average life equal to the Remaining Average Life and trading in the secondary market at the price closest to the principal amount thereof (the "Primary Issue"); , , that if no United States Treasury security has an average life equal to the Remaining Average Life, the yields (the "Other Yields") for the two maturities of United States Treasury securities having average lives most closely corresponding to such Remaining Average Life and trading in the secondary market at the price closest to the principal amount thereof shall be calculated, and the yield to maturity for the Primary Issue shall be the yield interpolated or
(ii)
          
provided
however
 
extrapolated from such Other Yields on a straight line basis, rounding in each of such relevant periods to the nearest month;
 
the discounted present value of the then-remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (but excluding that portion of any scheduled payment of interest that is actually due and paid on the Determination Date) in respect of the Outstanding Series G Senior Notes shall be calculated as of the Determination Date using a discount factor equal to the sum of (x) the yield to maturity for the Primary Issue, (y) 50 basis points; and
(iii)
         
plus
 
the amount of Applicable Premium in respect of the Series G Senior Notes to be redeemed shall be an amount equal to (x) the discounted present value of such Series G Senior Notes to be redeemed determined in accordance with clause (iii) above, (y) the unpaid principal amount of such Series G Senior Notes; , , that the Applicable Premium shall not be less than zero; and
(iv)
         
minus
provided
however
 
such calculation shall be made by an Investment Banker.
(v)
          
 
.  The Indenture is hereby amended, pursuant to Section 7.1(d) of the Original Indenture for the benefit of the holders of the Series G Senior Notes and for so long as the Series G Senior Notes are outstanding, as follows:
