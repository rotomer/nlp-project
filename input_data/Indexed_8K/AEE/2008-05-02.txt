FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., May 2, 2008Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced first quarter 2008 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $138 million, or 66 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2007 GAAP net income of $123 million, or 59 cents per share.  Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded first quarter 2008 core (non-GAAP) net income of $134 million, or 64 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2007 core (non-GAAP) net income of $145 million, or 70 cents per share.
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were below the same period in 2007 principally because of higher fuel prices, increased distribution system reliability spending and the impact of electric rate redesign in Illinois. In late 2007, the Illinois Commerce Commission authorized redesigned electric rates to reduce seasonal fluctuations for residential customers who use electricity to heat their homes. The effect of these redesigned rates will shift some revenues from winter to summer months with no impact on full year earnings. The earnings impact of these unfavorable items was reduced by, among other things, improved generation levels, higher power sale prices, the impact of colder weather on natural gas and power demand, and the benefit of the 2007 Missouri rate cases to earnings.
 
Our core earnings in the first quarter of this year were solid and consistent with our expectations, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. However, rising costs, coupled with significant levels of investment in our Illinois and Missouri regulated businesses, continue to negatively impact our earnings. This is because our current rate levels are not sufficient to recover our costs and provide reasonable returns.
 
To address this issue, we have filed rate increase requests for all our utilities. In November 2007, we filed for electric and gas delivery service rate increases in Illinois, which, as amended, total $220 million. In April 2008, we filed for a $251 million electric rate increase in Missouri. These cases continue to progress and are expected to take about 11 months to complete. Achieving constructive regulatory outcomes in these cases is critical to our ability to invest in our energy

infrastructure in order to meet our customers expectations and deliver safe, reliable service, added Rainwater.
 
GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2008 exceeded the 2007 period principally because of significant net unusual costs and certain non-core items. The net effect of these items have been excluded from core (non-GAAP) earnings comparisons. They include the following:
 
A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
 
Ameren reaffirmed today it expects 2008 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $2.68 to $3.08 and core (non-GAAP) earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. Excluded from 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance are an estimated 12 cents per share negative impact in 2008 of the Illinois comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement and any net mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges. Ameren modestly revised the contribution its business segments are expected to make to 2008 core earnings per share (non-GAAP) principally because of higher financing costs and higher power prices as follows:

Amerens guidance for 2008 assumes normal weather and is subject to, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, severe storms, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses, and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
 
I believe achieving constructive regulatory returns in our pending rate cases, increasing our investment in our regulated businesses in response to customer needs and optimizing our non-rate-regulated generation business will position Ameren to continue to deliver solid shareholder value in the years ahead, added Rainwater.
 
Missouri Regulated Operations
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were $45 million, compared to $40 million in the first quarter of 2007. Among other things, the benefit of the 2007 Missouri rate cases, improved generation levels and higher power prices for off-system sales more than offset higher fuel prices, increased distribution system reliability spending and generally higher costs. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were $52 million, or $34 million higher than the first quarter of 2007.  In addition to the items noted above, this increase was primarily driven by $29 million of certain non-core items associated with the cost of severe storms; the absence in 2008 of a retroactive FERC order in 2007 that increased costs; and net mark-to-market gains from nonqualifying hedges between periods.
 
Illinois Regulated Operations
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were $18 million, or $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by redesigned Illinois electric rates, higher bad debt expenses and increased distribution system reliability spending. Colder weather benefited earnings in the first quarter of 2008, compared to the prior-year period. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were $16 million, or $17 million lower than the first quarter of 2007.  In addition to the items noted above, this difference was driven by the cost of the Illinois electric settlement in 2008; the first quarter 2007 reversal of a 2006 charge related to funding commitments for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency programs; the costs of the retroactive FERC order in 2007; and severe storms in 2007.
 
Non-rate-regulated Generation Operations
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were $80 million, or $13 million higher than the first quarter of 2007. The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings between the first quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 was primarily driven by improved generation levels and higher
 
 
Add three
 
power prices. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were $78 million, or $8 million higher than the first quarter of 2007. In addition to the items noted above, this change was driven by the benefit of the retroactive FERC order, net mark-to-market gains from nonqualifying hedges and the costs of the Illinois electric settlement.
 
Ameren will conduct a conference call for financial analysts at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time) on Friday, May 2, to discuss 2008 first quarter earnings and other matters. Investors, the news media and the public may listen to a live Internet broadcast of the call at www.ameren.com by clicking on "Q1 2008 Ameren Corporation Earnings Conference Call," then the appropriate audio link. A slide presentation will also be available on Amerens website reconciling earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2007, and reconciling 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance to 2007 earnings per share on a comparable share basis. This presentation will be posted in the Investors section of the Web site under Presentations. The analyst call will also be available for replay on the Internet for one year. Telephone playback of the conference call will also be available beginning at 11:00 a.m. (Central Time), from May 2 through May 9, by dialing, U.S. (800) 405-2236; international (303) 590-3000 and entering the number: 11112418#.
 
With assets of approximately $21 billion, Ameren serves approximately 2.4 million electric customers and almost one million natural gas customers in a 64,000 square mile area of Missouri and Illinois. Ameren owns a diverse mix of electric generating plants strategically located in its Midwest market with a generating capacity of more than 16,400 megawatts.
 
Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance excludes one or more of the following: costs related to severe January 2007 storms, the earnings impact of the settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance, the reversal of accruals made in 2006 for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency program funding commitments in Illinois, a March 2007 FERC order, which retroactively adjusted prior years regional transmission organization costs, and net mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes it allows it to more accurately compare the companys ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP for certain items, such as the 2007 Illinois electric settlement and net mark-to market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges.  Except for the Illinois electric settlement, Ameren is not able to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of these items.
