FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Aug 1, 2008Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second quarter 2008 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $206 million, or 98 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2007 GAAP net income of $143 million, or 69 cents per share.  Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded second quarter 2008 core (non-GAAP) net income of $142 million, or 67 cents per share, compared with second quarter 2007 core (non-GAAP) net income of $138 million, or 67 cents per share.
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings per share in the second quarter of 2008 were comparable with the same period in 2007. Higher electric and gas margins and the benefit of not having a Callaway Nuclear Plant refueling and maintenance outage in the second quarter of 2008, as occurred in the second quarter of 2007, were largely offset by the following factors: higher fuel prices, increased spending on utility distribution system reliability, coal-fired plant operations and maintenance and other operating expenses, and the earnings impact of milder weather.
 
GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2008 exceeded the same period in 2007 because of several significant, unusual items. The net effect of these items has been excluded from core (non-GAAP) earnings comparisons. They include the following:

of a contract. This payment benefited second quarter 2008 net income by $16 million, but will result in higher fuel costs for non-rate-regulated generation in 2009.
 
Net income in accordance with GAAP for the first six months of 2008 was $344 million, or $1.64 per share, compared to $266 million, or $1.29 per share, in the first half of 2007. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded first half 2008 core (non-GAAP) net income of $276 million, or $1.31 per share, compared to first half 2007 core (non-GAAP) net income of $283 million, or $1.38 per share. A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
 
Our core earnings for the first half of 2008 were consistent with our expectations, but some unusual items drove our GAAP earnings higher, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. Like our customers are seeing for everyday items, our business is experiencing significant cost increases. This is occurring during a period when we also need to make substantial investments in our systems for improved reliability and cleaner air. We have proactively taken actions to manage these cost increases, especially as they relate to our fuel costs. To date, our actions have been very effective, but we simply can not entirely eliminate the rising costs which are impacting many aspects of our business.
 
These cost pressures, coupled with significant investments in our utility infrastructure, have required us to seek rate increases for both our Illinois and Missouri regulated operations. We expect decisions on these rate requests from Illinois and Missouri regulators in September 2008 and February 2009, respectively. Achieving constructive outcomes in these cases is critical to our ability to

continue to invest in our infrastructure so that we will be able to meet our customers expectations for safe and reliable service, added Rainwater.
 
Ameren also announced today that it has reaffirmed its expectations for core (non-GAAP) earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. Excluded from 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance is an estimated 12 cents per share negative impact of the Illinois comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement, the 8 cents per share benefit from the coal contract settlement related to expected 2009 costs and the 4 cents per share positive impact of a Missouri Public Service Commission accounting order associated with 2007 storm costs. Ameren also reaffirmed the contribution its business segments are expected to make to 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share. The expected contributions are as follows:
 
 
Ameren also adjusted its expectations for 2008 GAAP earnings and looks for them to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.20 per share, up from the previous estimate of $2.68 to $3.08 per share. The increase in its GAAP earnings guidance range was driven by the 8 cents per share benefit from the coal contract settlement related to expected 2009 costs and the 4 cents per share positive impact of the Missouri Public Service Commission accounting order, as previously discussed. Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges will impact GAAP earnings, but are excluded from GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any gains or losses due to the volatility of markets.
 
Amerens guidance for 2008 assumes normal weather and is subject to, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions, plant operations, energy market and economic conditions, severe storms, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses, and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
 
Missouri Regulated Operations
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the second quarter of 2008 were $77 million, compared to $68 million in the second quarter of 2007. Earnings in the second quarter of 2008 primarily benefited from the lack of a refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Nuclear Plant, as occurred in the second quarter of 2007, and higher power prices for off-system sales. These improvements more than offset higher fuel prices, increased distribution system reliability and plant maintenance spending and other higher operating costs. GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2008 were $122 million, or $55 million higher than in the second quarter of 2007.  In addition to the items noted above, this increase

was primarily driven by net unrealized mark-to-market gains from nonqualifying hedges of future fuel transportation costs and the estimated minimum benefit of an accounting order from the Missouri Public Service Commission associated with 2007 storm costs. The value of the nonqualifying hedges will fluctuate over time based on current market prices.
 
Illinois Regulated Operations
 
In the second quarter of 2008, Illinois regulated operations recorded a core (non-GAAP) loss of $10 million, compared to earnings of $20 million in the second quarter of 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by increased distribution system reliability spending, higher bad debt expenses and increased financing costs. Illinois regulated operations recorded a GAAP loss of $14 million, compared to earnings of $20 million in the second quarter of 2007. In addition to the items noted above, this difference was driven by the cost of the Illinois comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement in 2008.
 
Non-rate-regulated Generation Operations
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the second quarter of 2008 were $77 million, or $27 million higher than in the second quarter of 2007. The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings between the second quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008 was primarily driven by higher realized electric margins. GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2008 were $98 million, compared with $56 million in the second quarter of 2007. In addition to the items noted above, this change was driven by net unrealized mark-to-market gains principally from nonqualifying hedges of future fuel transportation costs and a lump-sum payment in the second quarter of 2008 from a coal supplier for expected higher fuel costs in 2009 as a result of the premature closure of a mine and termination of a contract. This payment benefited 2008 second quarter net income by $16 million, but will result in higher fuel costs for non-rate-regulated generation in 2009. The benefit of these items more than offset the costs of the Illinois comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement in the second quarter of 2008.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance excludes one or more of the following: costs related to severe January 2007 storms, the earnings impact of the settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance, the reversal of accruals made in 2006 for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency program funding commitments in Illinois, a March 2007 FERC order, which retroactively adjusted prior years regional transmission organization costs, net mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges, the estimated minimum benefit of an accounting order from the Missouri Public Service Commission associated with 2007 storm costs and the 2008 lump-sum payment from a coal supplier for expected higher fuel costs in 2009 as a result of the premature closure of a mine and termination of a contract. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes it allows it to more accurately compare the companys ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP for certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of certain items, such as the ultimate earnings impact of the Missouri Public Service Commission storm cost-related order, or net mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges.
