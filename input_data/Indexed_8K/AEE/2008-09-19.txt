ITEM 8.01  Other Events.
 
On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York.  Ameren Corporation (Ameren) and its subsidiaries, Union Electric Company, doing business as AmerenUE (UE), Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Ameren Energy Generating Company (Genco), CILCORP Inc. (CILCORP), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP), AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company (AERG), Ameren Energy Marketing Company (Marketing Company) and Ameren Energy Fuels and Services Company (AFS) (collectively the Ameren Companies) have business relationships with subsidiaries of Lehman.  The Ameren Companies believe that their direct exposures resulting from the Lehman bankruptcy and the possible resulting effects on subsidiaries of Lehman will not have a material adverse effect on the Ameren Companies, either individually or collectively.
 
UE, CIPS, Genco, IP, Marketing Company and AFS are counterparties with Lehman Brothers Commodity Services Inc. (Lehman Commodity Services) and Eagle Energy Partners I, LP (Eagle Energy), subsidiaries of Lehman, in energy commodity transactions that support their utility and generation businesses.  The obligations of Lehman Commodity Services and Eagle Energy are guaranteed by Lehman, and the Lehman bankruptcy filing gives UE, CIPS, Genco, IP, Marketing Company and AFS the right to terminate the transactions.  As of September 15, 2008, Ameren and it subsidiaries direct exposure to Lehman Commodity Services and Eagle Energy, based on existing contracts and current market prices, was estimated to be less than $1 million before taxes, individually and collectively.
 
Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG have an aggregate of $2.15 billion of committed credit facilities with a consortium of banks including Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB and Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank, subsidiaries of Lehman.  Reference is made to Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 4  Credit Facilities and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, each in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007; and to Note 3  Short-term Borrowings and Liquidity to our financial statements under Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part I, Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, each in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2008 of Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO and IP, for a discussion of these credit facilities.  As of Lehmans bankruptcy filing on September 15, 2008, Lehmans subsidiaries total commitments, within these credit facilities was $171 million:  Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB - $100 million under the $1.15 billion credit facility and $21 million under the 2006 $500 million credit facility; and Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank - $50 million

under the 2007 $500 million credit facility.  On September 17, 2008, CIPS, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG consented to a request from Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank to assign its $50 million commitment under the 2007 $500 million credit facility to Commerzbank AG.  At this time, we do not know if Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB will seek to assign to other parties any of its commitments within our credit facilities.
 
As of September 18, 2008, Ameren had available liquidity (including cash balances) of approximately $1.197 billion, excluding the $121 million of Lehman Brothers Bank, FSBs credit facilities commitments.  Ameren, UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCORP, CILCO, IP and AERG do not believe that the potential reduction in available capacity under the credit facilities if Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB does not fund its commitments will have a material impact on their liquidity.  Since the Lehman bankruptcy filing, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB has honored a funding request under the credit facilities.
 
The following table summarizes the bank commitments under the existing $2.15 billion of committed credit facilities and the borrowings outstanding under such facilities as of September 18, 2008:
