FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Nov. 4, 2008Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today reported third quarter 2008 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $204 million, or 97 cents per share, compared to third quarter 2007 GAAP net income of $244 million, or $1.18 per share.  Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded third quarter 2008 core (non-GAAP) net income of $246 million, or $1.17 per share, compared to third quarter 2007 core (non-GAAP) net income of $277 million, or $1.33 per share.
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings per share in the third quarter of 2008 were lower than core (non-GAAP) earnings per share in the same period in 2007.  The negative impacts of milder summer weather, higher fuel prices and increased spending on utility distribution system reliability, among other things, more than offset the positive impacts of higher electric margins from non-rate-regulated generation operations and the timing benefit of seasonally redesigned electric rates in Illinois.
 
The following items are excluded from third quarter 2008 and third quarter 2007 core (non-GAAP) earnings:

Net income in accordance with GAAP for the first nine months of 2008 was $548 million, or $2.61 per share, compared to $510 million, or $2.46 per share, for the first nine months of 2007.  Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded core (non-GAAP) net income of $525 million, or $2.50 per share for the first nine months of 2008, compared to core (non-GAAP) net income of $560 million, or $2.70 per share for the first nine months of 2007. A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
 
As expected, our core earnings for both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2008 were down from the prior year periods, said Gary L. Rainwater, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. Milder summer weather reduced our third quarter 2008 earnings by an estimated 18 cents per share as temperatures were less extreme than those experienced during last years very hot summer.  During the third quarter of 2008, cooling degree-days across the Ameren system were 27% lower than during the third quarter of 2007, leading to declines in weather-sensitive residential and commercial electricity sales of 16% and 8%, respectively. In addition, rising costs for fuel and expenditures to improve distribution system reliability reduced core earnings for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2008.
 
Rising cost pressures, coupled with significant investments in our utility infrastructure, have required us to seek rate increases for both our Illinois and Missouri regulated operations. In September, the Illinois Commerce Commission authorized much needed rate increases for our electric and gas distribution businesses. The new rates became effective October 1, 2008.  In Missouri, our pending electric rate case is moving forward, and we expect a decision from the Public Service Commission in late January or in February 2009 with new rates anticipated to be effective March 1, 2009.  A constructive outcome in the Missouri case is critical to our ability to continue to invest in our infrastructure so that we will be able to meet our customers expectations for safe and

reliable service, as well as have access to the capital markets to finance our operations during this highly uncertain period in the financial markets, added Rainwater.
 
2008 Earnings Guidance
 
Ameren also announced today that it has narrowed its expectations for 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.00 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.80 to $3.20 per share, primarily because of lower-than-expected power prices in the second half of the year and mild summer weather.
 
Excluded from 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance is an estimated 12 cents per share negative impact of the Illinois comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement, the 8 cents per share benefit from a coal contract settlement related to expected 2009 costs, the 4 cents per share positive impact of a Missouri Public Service Commission accounting order associated with 2007 storm costs and net mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges.
 
Ameren also revised the range of contributions its business segments are expected to provide to 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share. The revised expected contributions are as follows:
 
 
Further, Ameren adjusted its expectations for 2008 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.00 per share versus the prior range of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. The change corresponds to the revised core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance range. Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges will impact GAAP earnings, but are excluded from GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any gains or losses due to the volatility of markets.
 
Amerens guidance for 2008 assumes normal fourth quarter weather and is subject to, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions, plant operations, energy and capital market conditions, economic conditions, severe storms, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses, and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
 
Missouri Regulated Operations
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the third quarter of 2008 were $141 million, compared to $178 million in the third quarter of 2007. The decline in core (non-GAAP) earnings was primarily due to

much cooler summer weather in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the very hot weather in the year ago period, as well as due to higher fuel prices in the third quarter of 2008. GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2008 were $98 million, or $80 million lower than in the third quarter of 2007.  In addition to the items noted above, this decrease was primarily due to net unrealized mark-to-market losses from nonqualifying hedges of future fuel transportation costs. The value of the nonqualifying hedges will fluctuate over time based on then current market prices.
 
Illinois Regulated Operations
 
In the third quarter of 2008, Illinois regulated operations core (non-GAAP) earnings were $17 million compared to $8 million in the third quarter of 2007. The increase reflects the earnings benefit of $23 million from seasonally redesigned electric rates. Over the course of the full year, this rate redesign is not expected to have any net impact on earnings. Third quarter 2008 earnings were negatively impacted versus the year-ago period by much cooler summer weather, increased distribution system reliability spending and higher bad debt expenses, among other items. Illinois regulated operations recorded GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2008 of $13 million, compared to a loss of $8 million in the third quarter of 2007. In addition to the items noted above, this difference was driven primarily by the cost of the Illinois comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement, which reduced earnings in the third quarter of 2008 and 2007.
 
Non-rate-regulated Generation Operations
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the second quarter of 2008 were $98 million, or $8 million higher than in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings was primarily driven by higher realized electric margins due, in part, to improved plant operations. GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2008 were $108 million, compared with $71 million in the third quarter of 2007. In addition to the item noted above, this change was driven by net unrealized mark-to-market gains primarily related to nonqualifying hedges of changes in electricity prices in the third quarter of 2008, and the cost of the Illinois comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance settlement agreement in the third quarter of 2007.
 
Commentary on Available Liquidity and Capital and Credit Markets
 
The global financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in 2008, and, in particular, since early September. This disruption has led to major financial institutions coming under financial duress, significant strains in the credit markets, deteriorating economic conditions and steep declines in stock prices. The United States government and governments around the world have established programs to strengthen the global financial system. We are encouraged by these efforts and believe that, in time, these efforts will benefit the financial markets. However, in the interim, these

events have impacted our company and we believe they will continue to impact us through 2009 and perhaps longer, said Rainwater.
 
Our management team remains sharply focused on providing our customers with safe and reliable electric and gas service, as well as complying with federal and state environmental, reliability, and other regulations. We are balancing these operational objectives with the need to proactively manage our finances in these highly volatile and uncertain markets.
 
 At October 31, 2008, our available liquidity, which represents our cash on hand and amounts available under our credit facilities, stood at approximately $1.45 billion, up about $550 million from this same time last year. Despite this solid liquidity position, we are reducing 2009 operating and capital expenditures in our non-rate regulated generation business by a total of $400 million to $500 million. Operating and capital expenditures in 2009 for this business will be approximately $300 million to $400 million below 2008 levels.  Other meaningful capital expenditure deferral and reduction opportunities are also under review throughout the rest of our business.
 
Looking ahead, we will remain focused on prudently managing our operations and maintaining strong overall liquidity to meet our operating, capital and financing needs, as well as executing our long-term strategic plans to enhance shareholder value above current depressed levels, which I believe do not reflect the strong underlying value of our company, added Rainwater.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance excludes one or more of the following: costs related to severe January 2007 storms, the earnings impact of the settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance, the reversal of accruals made in 2006 for low-income energy assistance and energy efficiency program funding commitments in Illinois, a March 2007 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order, which retroactively adjusted prior years regional transmission organization costs, net mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges, the estimated minimum benefit of an accounting order from the Missouri Public Service Commission associated with 2007 storm costs and the 2008 lump-sum payment from a coal supplier for expected higher fuel costs in 2009 as a result of the premature closure of a mine and termination of a contract. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes it allows it to more accurately compare the companys ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP for certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of certain items, such as the ultimate earnings impact of the Missouri Public Service Commission storm cost-related order, or net mark-to-market gains or losses from nonqualifying hedges.
