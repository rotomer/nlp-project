Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
From time to time, Central Illinois Light Company, d/b/a AmerenCILCO, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each, a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its senior secured debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities").  The Designated Securities will be secured by a series of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "First Mortgage Bonds"), in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date and other terms as the Designated Securities to which they relate.
 
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities (including the First Mortgage Bonds securing such Designated Securities) shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (as it may be amended or supplemented, including the terms of the Designated Securities to be set forth in an order of the Company thereunder, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").  The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Company's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1933, executed by the Company to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (successor to Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the "Mortgage Trustee" and, together with the Trustee, the "Trustees"), as heretofore amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, and as to be further amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture relating to the particular series of First Mortgage Bonds specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Supplemental Indenture").  The term
 
 
"Mortgage," as used herein, shall be deemed to refer to such Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust as so amended and supplemented.
 
1.
            
Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in this Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives").  The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters or to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives.  This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities.  The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein.  Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the title and aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the series of First Mortgage Bonds securing such Designated Securities, the Supplemental Indenture relating to such First Mortgage Bonds, the Time of Sale and the Time of Sale Information (in each case, as defined therein) with respect to such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, if any, and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor.  The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in or pursuant to the Indenture and the registration statement, preliminary prospectus and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities.  A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted.  The obligations of the Underwriters under this Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
 
6.
            
Whether or not any sale of the Securities is consummated, the Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and any dealers; (ii) the applicable Commission filing fees relating to the Designated Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso thereof; (iii) the cost of printing or producing any agreement among Underwriters, this Underwriting Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, the Mortgage, any blue sky surveys, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iv) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(c) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with any blue sky surveys; (v) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (vi) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vii) the cost of preparing

Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that, except for one or more term sheets containing the information set forth in Schedule III to the applicable Pricing Agreement, it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the use of, any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) one or more term sheets relating to the Designated Securities which are not Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses and which contain preliminary terms of the Designated Securities and related customary information not consistent with the final term sheet prepared and filed by the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, (ii) a free writing prospectus that contains no "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Act) that was not included (including through incorporation by reference) in the Preliminary Prospectus or a previously filed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (iii) any Bloomberg L.P. or other electronic communication regarding comparable bond prices, (iv) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Annex III hereto or prepared pursuant to Section 2(v) or Section 5(a) hereof, or (v) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing.
 
8.
            
The obligations of the several Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company contained herein and in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of the Time of Sale and the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed at and as of the Time of Sale and the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, as the case may be, and the following additional conditions:

(e)
          
(i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the most recent audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, any loss or interference with their business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (x) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, or entered into any transactions, not in the ordinary course of business, that are material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (y) there shall not have been any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or consolidated results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
 
(f)
           
On or prior to the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received satisfactory evidence that the Designated Securities have received ratings of BBB+ or higher by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Baa2 or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and A- or higher by Fitch, Inc., and that such ratings are in effect at the Time of Delivery;

(i)
           
The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(d) hereof with respect to the furnishing of the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Underwriting Agreement or next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement, as applicable;
 
(j)

Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
 
9.
            
(a)  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or, in the case of any action arising out of the issuance and sale of the Securities, in any prior registration statement to which the Prospectus, as a combined prospectus under Rule 429 under the Act, relates), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed under Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such
 
action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in any such action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable
 
fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of any such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this
 
subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
10.
          
(a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Underwriting Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
 
(b)
          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate
 
principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.           The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Underwriting Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.           If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein or the Company does not comply with its other obligations as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof.
 
13.           In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
14.           This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Underwriting Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement.  No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.           Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement.  As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.  As used herein, "New York Business Day" shall mean any day other than Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banks located in the State of New York are authorized or obligated to close.
 
16.           This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
17.          
The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Underwriting Agreement
and each Pricing Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
 
18.           This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
19.           The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person.  Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriters are advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby.  The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated
 
hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.  Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof.

ANNEX II
 
Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
 
They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB");
(i)
           
 
In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
(ii)
          
 
They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the PCAOB of the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [           ] incorporated by reference into the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus;
(iii)
         
 
They have compared the ratios of earnings to fixed charges in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K;
(iv)
         
 
On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inspection of the minute books of the Company since the date of the latest audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (i) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [  ] incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or (ii) the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [  ] incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in
(v)
          
 
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
 
nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that (i) at [  ], there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable) or decrease in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the [  ] unaudited consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [  ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, or (ii) for the period from[  ] to [  ], there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur and except such other decreases as may be specified in such letter;
(vi)
         
 
officials of the Company have advised them that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to [  ] are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by them with respect to changes in financial statement items after [  ] have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in paragraph (v).  They have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at [  ] there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable) or decrease in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the [  ] unaudited consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [  ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus; or (b) for the period from [  ] to [  ], there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or net income.  Those officials referred to above stated that they cannot comment on any decreases in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity at [  ] compared to [  ], or decreases as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year in consolidated operating revenues or net income for the period from [  ] to [   ].  On the basis of these inquiries and their reading of the minutes as described in paragraph (v), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that there was any such change in capital stock or increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable), except in all instances for changes or increases which the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur.
(vii)
        
 
In addition to the examination referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraph (v) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its
(viii)
       
 
subsidiaries, which appear in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
 
All references in this Annex II to the Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Preliminary Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) included with the Time of Sale Information (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Pricing Agreement for purposes of such letter.

$150,000,000 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
you and the Company dated December 4, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement") and a Pricing Agreement between you and the Company dated December 4, 2008 (the "Pricing Agreement").
I am Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Central Illinois Light Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), and, together with Craig W. Stensland, Esq., an Associate General Counsel of Ameren Services Company, an affiliate of the Company which provides legal and other professional services to the Company, have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement between
 
(successor to Bankers Trust Company), as trustee, as heretofore amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, and as now being further amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") dated as of December 1, 2008 (as so supplemented and amended pursuant to the terms thereof, the "Mortgage").  Unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized terms used in this opinion shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.  This opinion is being furnished pursuant to Section 8(c)(i) of the Underwriting Agreement.
The Notes are being issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (including the order of the Company thereunder setting forth the terms of the Notes, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").  The Notes will be secured by the Company's First Mortgage Bonds designated "First Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes Series CC" (the "First Mortgage Bonds"), in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date as the Notes which they secure.  The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Company's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1933, executed by the Company to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas
 
I have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of: (1) resolutions adopted at the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company on June 13,
 
2008 and November 13, 2008 in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes and the issuance of the First Mortgage Bonds; (2) the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement; (3) the Indenture and the Mortgage; (4) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-155416-01), filed by the Company to register the Notes with the Commission under the Act, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the Act and any information omitted from such registration statement at the time any part of such registration statement became effective but that is deemed to be part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430(B) under the Act at the time set forth therein (collectively, the "Registration Statement"); (5) the prospectus dated November 17, 2008 as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated December 4, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the Act, filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (collectively, the "Preliminary Prospectus"); (6) the pricing term sheet dated December 4, 2008 relating to the Notes filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act (the "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus" and, together with the Preliminary Prospectus, the "Time of Sale Information"); (7) the prospectus dated November 17, 2008 as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated December 4, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the Act, filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (collectively, the "Prospectus"); and (8) such other documents, certificates, instruments and records as I have considered necessary or appropriate for purposes of the opinion contained herein.  In addition, I have discussed and conferred with officers and employees of the Company and its affiliates and made such investigation of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of said opinion.  Lastly, in rendering this opinion, I have relied as to factual matters upon certificates or written statements from appropriate representatives of the Company or upon certificates of public officials.
 
I am of the opinion that:
 
(i)
           
To the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, and other than as set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or such subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or such subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or others; there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit (either thereto or to a document incorporated therein by reference), that is not described or filed as required; and the statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus describing any legal proceedings or material contracts or agreements relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries fairly summarize such matters;
 
(ii)
          
The documents incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and
 
related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no belief), when they were filed with the Commission complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;
 
(iii)
         
The
Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes and the application of the net proceeds thereof, will not be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an investment company, as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and
 
(iv)
         
The Registration Statement
, as of the date that it was filed with the Commission,
and the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, as of the date each was filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (in each case, other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no opinion), complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; although I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, except for those that relate to me, I have no reason to believe that (1) the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no opinion), as of the most recent effective date of the part of the Registration Statement relating to the Notes determined pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (2) the Time of Sale Information (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no opinion), at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (3) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which I express no opinion), as of its date or on the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; the Registration Statement has become, and as of the date hereof is, effective under the Act; any required filing of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, has been made in the manner and within the time period required by the applicable paragraph of such Rule 424(b); any required filing of the Issuer Free Writing
 
Prospectus, pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act, has been made in the manner and within the time period required by such Rule 433; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened under Section 8 or Section 8A of the Act.
 
To the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, there is no litigation, pending or threatened, that challenges the validity of the Notes, the Indenture, the First Mortgage Bonds, the Mortgage, the Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement, or that seeks to enjoin the performance of the Company's obligations thereunder or that might have a Material Adverse Effect except as disclosed in or contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Missouri and, for purposes of this opinion, do not hold myself out as an expert on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Missouri and the United States of America.
 
My opinion is addressed to you and is rendered solely for your benefit and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person without my prior written consent.
 
Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am an Associate General Counsel of Ameren Services Company, an affiliate of Central Illinois Light Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), which provides legal and other professional services to the Company and, together with Steven R. Sullivan, Esq., Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 (the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement between
you
and the Company dated December 4, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement") and a Pricing Agreement between you and the Company dated December 4, 2008 (the "Pricing Agreement").
 
The Notes are being issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (including the order of the Company thereunder setting forth the terms of the Notes, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").  The Notes will be secured by the Company's First Mortgage Bonds designated "First Mortgage Bonds, Senior Notes Series CC" (the "First Mortgage Bonds"), in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date as the Notes which they secure.  The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Company's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1933, executed by the Company to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas
(successor to Bankers Trust Company), as trustee
, as heretofore amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, and as now being further amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture") dated as of December 1, 2008 (as so supplemented and amended pursuant to the terms thereof, the "Mortgage").  Unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized terms used in this opinion shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.  This opinion is being furnished pursuant to Section 8(c)(ii) of the Underwriting Agreement.
 
 
I have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of: (1) resolutions adopted at the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company on June 13, 2008 and November 13, 2008 in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes and the issuance of the First Mortgage Bonds; (2) the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement; (3) the Indenture and the Mortgage; (4) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-155416-01), filed by the Company to register the Notes with the Commission under the Act, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the Act and any information omitted from such registration statement at the time any part of such registration statement became effective but that is deemed to be part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430(B) under the Act at the time set forth therein (collectively, the "Registration Statement"); (5) the prospectus dated November 17, 2008 as supplemented by a preliminary prospectus supplement dated December 4, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the Act, filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (collectively, the "Preliminary Prospectus"); (6) the pricing term sheet dated December 4, 2008 relating to the Notes filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act (the "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus" and, together with the Preliminary Prospectus, the "Time of Sale Information"); (7) the prospectus dated November 17, 2008 as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated December 4, 2008, including the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the Act, filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (collectively, the "Prospectus"); and (8) such other documents, certificates, instruments and records as I have considered necessary or appropriate for purposes of the opinion contained herein.  In addition, I have discussed and conferred with officers and employees of the Company and its affiliates and made such investigation of law as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of said opinion.  Lastly, in rendering this opinion, I have relied as to factual matters upon certificates or written statements from appropriate representatives of the Company or upon certificates of public officials.
 
I am of the opinion that:
 
(i)
           
The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Illinois, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus; and the Company is not required by the nature of its business to be licensed or qualified as a foreign corporation in any other state or jurisdiction;
 
(ii)
          
All of the issued and outstanding common stock or other ownership interests of each subsidiary of the Company has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable, and all of such common stock
or other ownership interests is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free from liens, encumbrances and defects of title;
 
(iii)
         
Each subsidiary of the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale
 
Information and the Prospectus; and each such subsidiary is duly qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all other jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(iv)
         
The Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
(v)
          
The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms and the terms of the Indenture, except as may be limited by the Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefit of the security afforded by the Indenture;
 
(vi)
         
The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by the Exceptions; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(vii)
        
The First Mortgage Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Mortgage Trustee and upon delivery in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage and the Indenture, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms and the terms of the Mortgage, except as may be limited by the Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefit of the security afforded by the Mortgage;
 
(viii)
       
The Mortgage (including the Supplemental Indenture) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to provisions of the Mortgage being limited by the laws of the State of Illinois affecting the remedies for the enforcement of the security provided for therein, which laws do not, in my opinion, make inadequate remedies necessary for the realization of the benefits of such security and except as may be limited by the Exceptions; and the Mortgage has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(ix)
          
The issue of the First Mortgage Bonds and the issue and sale of the Notes and the compliance by the Company with the provisions of the Notes, the Indenture, the First Mortgage Bonds, the Mortgage, the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement and the consummation
 
of the transactions therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties;
 
(x)
           
The statements set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus (together with the information set forth in the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus) and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Senior Secured Notes," "Description of Senior Secured Debt Securities" and "Description of First Mortgage Bonds and First Mortgage Indenture," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes, the Indenture, the Mortgage and the First Mortgage Bonds, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting," insofar as they purport to summarize the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate summaries in all material respects;
 
(xi)
          
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is (i) in violation of its by-laws or articles of incorporation or (ii) to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, in default in the performance or observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound;
 
(xii)
         
Except as otherwise set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, the Company has such valid franchises, certificates of convenience and necessity, operating rights, licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations and orders of governmental bodies, political subdivisions or regulatory authorities then obtainable, free from unduly burdensome restrictions, as are necessary for the acquisition, construction, ownership, maintenance and operation of the properties now owned by it and the conduct of the business now carried on by it as described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus, with minor exceptions that, in my opinion, do not interfere with the practical operation of the Company's business, and, to the best of my knowledge, after due inquiry, the Company is not in default or violation thereof in any material respect and is carrying on its business in substantial compliance therewith and with all applicable federal, state and other laws and regulations that are material to the Company;
 
(xiii)
        
The ICC has issued its final order or orders (collectively, the "ICC Order") authorizing the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company and the issuance of the First Mortgage Bonds by the Company to secure the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.  The ICC Order is in full force and effect and is sufficient to authorize the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Pricing Agreement to the extent authorization is required; the Notes and the First Mortgage Bonds issued pursuant to the ICC Order are valid and binding in accordance with their respective terms and the terms and limitations specified in the ICC Order, notwithstanding the ICC Order being later vacated, modified or otherwise held to be invalid by the ICC or a reviewing court subsequent to the issuance of the Notes and the First Mortgage Bonds; no other consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the issuance and sale of the Notes and the issuance of the First Mortgage Bonds by the Company, or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Pricing Agreement
,
the Indenture, the Mortgage, the Notes or the First Mortgage Bonds, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and except such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Underwriters (as to which I express no opinion);
 
(xiv)
       
The delivery to the Trustee in the State of New York of the First Mortgage Bonds is effective to perfect the security interest in the First Mortgage Bonds on the date of such delivery and, to the best of my knowledge, such security interest, is not subject to any prior liens;
 
(xv)
        
The statements in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus that are stated therein to have been made on my authority have been reviewed by me and, as to matters of law and legal conclusions, are correct;
 
(xvi)
       
The
Company has good and sufficient title to all or substantially all the permanent fixed properties and the material franchises, permits and licenses now owned by it, including those described or referred to in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus except as may be otherwise indicated therein, and no notice has been given to the Company by any governmental authority of any proceeding to condemn, purchase or otherwise acquire any material properties of the Company and, so far as I know, no such proceeding is contemplated;
 
(xvii)
      
The
Mortgage has been duly filed for recording and recorded in each county in the State of Illinois in which any permanent fixed property described in and conveyed by the Mortgage and now owned by the Company is located, and constitutes a legally valid and direct enforceable first mortgage lien (except as federal bankruptcy laws may affect the
 
validity of the lien of the Mortgage with respect to proceeds, products, rents, issues or profits of the property subject to such lien realized and additional property acquired within 90 days prior to and after the commencement of a case under such laws and except as enforcement of provisions thereof may be limited by the laws of the State of Illinois affecting the remedies for the enforcement of the security provided for in the Mortgage, which laws do not, in my opinion, make such remedies inadequate for realization of the benefits of such security, or limited by bankruptcy or insolvency laws of or other applicable laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
' rights generally or by general principles of equity) upon substantially all of the Company's fixed properties and franchises used or useful in its public utility businesses free from all prior or equal ranking liens, charges or encumbrances, subject only to permitted encumbrances and liens, as defined in the Mortgage, and to the provisions contained in the Mortgage for the release, or substitution and release, of property from the lien thereof;
 
(xviii)
     
No
recordation, registration or filing of the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or instrument of further assurance is necessary in the State of Illinois to make effective the security interest intended to be created by the Indenture with respect to the First Mortgage Bonds; and
 
(xix)
        
Substantially all physical properties and franchises used or useful in the Company's public utility businesses (other than those of the character not subject to the lien of the Mortgage) now owned by the Company are subject to the lien of the Mortgage, subject only to permitted encumbrances and liens, as defined in the Mortgage, and to the provisions contained in the Mortgage for the release, or substitution and release, of property from the lien thereof; and all physical properties and franchises used or useful in the Company's public utility businesses (other than those of the character not subject to the lien of the Mortgage) hereafter acquired by the Company and situated in counties in the State of Illinois in which the Mortgage shall be of record will, upon such acquisition, become subject to the lien of the Mortgage, subject, however, to such encumbrances and liens as are permitted thereby.
 
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Illinois and, for purposes of this opinion, do not hold myself out as an expert on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Illinois and the United States of America.  I have, with your consent, relied upon an opinion of even date herewith addressed to you of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, as to all matters in this opinion involving the application of the laws of the State of New York.
 
My opinion is addressed to you and is rendered solely for your benefit and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person without my prior written consent, provided that Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP may rely on this opinion as to matters covered by Illinois law in its opinion addressed to you dated the date hereof.
 
Very truly yours,

So long as any of the Notes of this Series are outstanding, the Company will not optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, and, therefore, the Release Date will not occur.  Additional Notes without limitation as to amount, and without the consent of the holders of the then Outstanding Notes, may also be authenticated and delivered in the manner provided in Section 2.05 of the Indenture.  All capitalized terms not defined herein which are defined in the Indenture shall have the same meaning as used in the Indenture.
 
In connection with this Company Order, there are delivered to you herewith the following:

THIS NOTE IS A GLOBAL NOTE REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF THE DEPOSITARY (REFERRED TO HEREIN) OR A NOMINEE THEREOF AND, UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL NOTES REPRESENTED HEREBY AS PROVIDED IN THE INDENTURE REFERRED TO BELOW, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY. UNLESS THIS NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (55 WATER STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK), TO THE TRUSTEE FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
 
CENTRAL ILLINOIS LIGHT COMPANY, a corporation of the State of Illinois (the "COMPANY"), for value received hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO. or registered assigns, the principal sum of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ($150,000,000) on the Maturity Date set forth above, and to pay interest thereon from December 9, 2008 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on the June 15 and December 15 in each year, commencing June 15, 2009, at the per annum Interest Rate set forth above, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, subject to certain interest rate increase provisions described below.  No interest shall accrue on the Maturity Date, so long as the principal amount of this Note is paid on the Maturity Date.  The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any such Interest Payment Date (except for interest payable on the Maturity Date set forth above or, if applicable, upon redemption or acceleration) will, as provided in the Indenture (as defined below), be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the June 1 or December 1 as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided that the first Interest Payment Date for any part of this Note, the Original Issue Date of which is after a Regular Record Date but prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date, shall be the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date; and provided that interest payable on the Maturity Date set forth above or, if applicable, upon redemption or acceleration, shall be payable to the Person to whom principal shall be payable.  Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Noteholders not more than fifteen days or fewer than ten days prior to such Special Record Date.  Payment of the principal of and interest and premium on this Note shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) of the Indenture.
 
This Note is a Global Note in respect of a duly authorized issue of 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES", which term includes any Global Notes representing such Notes) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series and any other outstanding series of Notes.  Reference is hereby made
 
 
to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered.  This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000.
 
The Notes will be secured by first mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated as of April 1, 1933, from the Company to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (successor to Bankers Trust Company), as trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "FIRST MORTGAGE").  Reference is made to the First Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of first mortgage bonds, under the First Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional first mortgage bonds may be issued.
 
So long as any of the Notes of this Series are outstanding, the Company will not optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, and, therefore, the Release Date will not occur.
 
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
 
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time.  The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to and including the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to and including the redemption date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date.  The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed.  
 
 
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes of this Series.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY PRICE" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
 
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER" means (A) BNP Paribas Securities Corp. or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in the United States (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Company.

We have not examined and are expressing no opinion or belief as to matters relating to titles to property, franchises or the nature, extent and priority of the lien purported to be created by the Company's first mortgage indenture or the recordation or perfection of such lien.  We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and, for purposes of this opinion, do not hold ourselves out as experts on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.  We have relied upon an opinion of even date herewith of Craig W. Stensland, Esq., Associate General Counsel of Ameren Services Company, an affiliate of the Company, with respect to the due authorization and validity, execution and delivery of the Notes by the Company.
 
 
On the basis of such review, we are of the opinion that the Notes constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 9, 2008, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement and the prospectus included as a part thereof and the supplement thereto relating to the offer and sale of the Notes.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
