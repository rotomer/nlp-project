Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
From time to time, Union Electric Company, d/b/a AmerenUE, a Missouri corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each, a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its senior secured debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities").  The Designated Securities will be secured by a series of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "First Mortgage Bonds"), in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date and other terms as the Designated Securities to which they relate.
 
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities (including the First Mortgage Bonds securing such Designated Securities) shall be as specified in the Pricing
 
Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Indenture dated as of August 15, 2002 (as it may be supplemented or amended, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, now known as The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee").  The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Company's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated June 15, 1937, executed by the Company to The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee (the "Mortgage Trustee" and, together with the Trustee, the "Trustees"), as heretofore amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, and as to be further amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture relating to the particular series of First Mortgage Bonds specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Supplemental Indenture").  The term "Mortgage," as used herein, shall be deemed to refer to such Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust as so amended and supplemented.
 
1.             Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in this Agreement or the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives").  The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters or to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives.  This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities.  The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein.  Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the title and aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the series of First Mortgage Bonds securing such Designated Securities, the Supplemental Indenture relating to such First Mortgage Bonds, the Time of Sale (as defined herein) with respect to such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, if any, and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor.  The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not set forth in or pursuant to the Indenture and the registration statement, preliminary prospectus and prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities.  A Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of communications transmitted.  The obligations of the Underwriters under this Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.
 
2.             The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that:

If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Designated Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline.

The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Designated Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible.  References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
 
6.             Whether or not any sale of the Securities is consummated, the Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and any dealers; (ii) the applicable Commission filing fees relating to the Designated Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso thereof; (iii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Underwriting Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, the Mortgage, any blue sky surveys, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iv) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(c) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with any blue sky surveys; (v) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (vi) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vii) the cost of preparing certificates for the Securities and the First Mortgage Bonds; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Trustees and any agent of the Trustees and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustees in connection with the Indenture, the Securities, the Mortgage and the First Mortgage Bonds; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 6.

counsel, any advertising expenses in connection with any offers the Underwriters may make and transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them.

(vii)         The Mortgage (including the Supplemental Indenture relating to the First Mortgage Bonds) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to provisions of the Mortgage being limited by the laws of the States of Missouri, Illinois or Iowa affecting the remedies for the enforcement of the security provided for therein, which laws do not, in such counsel's opinion, make inadequate remedies necessary for the realization of the benefits of such security and except as may be limited by the Exceptions; and the Mortgage has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act;

Such opinion shall also state that such counsel has no knowledge of any litigation, pending or threatened, that challenges the validity of the Designated Securities, the Indenture, the First Mortgage Bonds, the Mortgage, this Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement, or that seeks to enjoin the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder or thereunder or that might have a Material Adverse Effect except as disclosed in or contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.
 
Such counsel's opinion with respect to title of the Company to its properties and the rank of the lien of the Mortgage and the Supplemental Indenture shall state that with regard to such properties located in Illinois, it is based on consultations with Illinois counsel and may be, with regard to its properties owned in fee, based in whole or in part on title searches made on recent dates by title abstract companies, by other attorneys or real estate employees of an affiliate of the Company, and such counsel's opinion with regard to such other properties may be based in
 
whole or in part on title examinations made and title opinions rendered at various times by other attorneys regarded by him as competent, and, with regard to all properties of the Company, upon his general familiarity with titles to properties of the Company; provided that such counsel's opinion is stated to be in reliance upon such title searches or opinions.  Such counsel shall also state that such searches and opinions are satisfactory in scope and form to such counsel and that in such counsel's opinion, the Underwriters are justified in relying thereon.  Copies of such title searches or opinions shall be furnished to counsel for the Underwriters upon their reasonable request.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely (i) as to factual matters, upon certificates or written statements from appropriate representatives of the Company or upon certificates of public officials, and (ii) as to matters involving the application of the laws of the State of New York, upon the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters delivered to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8(b) hereof.
 
Such counsel's opinion may further state that it is addressed to the Underwriters and is rendered solely for their benefit and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person (other than counsel for the Underwriters as to certain matters involving the application of the laws of the States of Missouri, Illinois and Iowa in its opinion to the Underwriters at the Time of Delivery) without such counsel's prior written consent.
 
(d)           On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Underwriters a letter, dated the date of such Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
 
(e)           (i) The Company shall not have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (x) the Company has not incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, or entered into any transactions, not in the ordinary course of business, that are material to the Company and (y) there shall not have been any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and
 
adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
 
(f)            On or prior to the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received satisfactory evidence that the Designated Securities have received ratings of BBB or higher by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Baa1 or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and that such ratings are in effect at the Time of Delivery;
 
(g)           On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any Rating Agency, and (ii) no such Rating Agency shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock, unless such surveillance or review has been publicly announced prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement;
 
(h)           On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally by the Commission, the New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market or any setting of minimum or maximum prices for trading thereon; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities by the Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by Federal, New York State or Missouri State authorities or a material disruption has occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus;
 
(i)            The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Underwriting Agreement or next succeeding the date of the Pricing Agreement, as applicable;
 
(j)            The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request; and
 
(k)           The MPSC Order shall be in full force and effect at the Time of Delivery.
 
If any of the events specified in Sections 8(e), 8(g) or 8(h) hereof shall have occurred or the representation in Section 2(s) is incorrect in any respect, the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities may be terminated by the Representatives on notice to the Company at any time on or prior to the Time of Delivery and upon such notice being given, the parties hereto and thereto shall be released and discharged from their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder (except for the liability of the Company pursuant to Sections 6 or 12 hereof and the obligations of the parties hereto and thereto pursuant to Section 9 hereof).  Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
 
9.             (a)  The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or, in the case of any action arising out of the issuance and sale of the Securities, in any prior registration statement to which the Prospectus, as a combined prospectus under Rule 429 under the Act, relates), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed under Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement.
 
(b)           Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
 
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)           Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in any such action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of any such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of
 
any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
(e)           The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
10.           (a)  If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Underwriting Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
 
(b)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)           If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.           The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Underwriting Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12.           If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein or the Company does not comply with its other obligations as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof.
 
13.           In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
14.           This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Underwriting Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement.  No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
 
15.           Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement.  As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.  As used herein, "New York Business Day" shall mean any day other than Saturday, Sunday or any day on which banks located in the State of New York are authorized or obligated to close.
 
16.           This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
17.           Sales of the Designated Securities by BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC will be effected by Broadpoint Capital, Inc., as distribution agent.
 
18.           This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
19.           The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person.  Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriters are advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby.  The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.  Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof.

OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.

Except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Noteholders not more than fifteen days or fewer than ten days prior to such Special Record Date.  Payment of the principal of and interest and premium on this Note shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) of the Indenture.
 
This Note is a Global Note in respect of a duly authorized issue of 8.45% Senior Secured Notes due 2039 (the "NOTES OF THIS SERIES", which term includes any Global Notes representing such Notes) of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of August 15, 2002, between the Company and The Bank of New York, now known as The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "TRUSTEE", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "INDENTURE"). Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series and any other outstanding series of Notes.  Reference is
 
hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered.  This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof in the aggregate principal amount of $350,000,000.
 
The Notes will be secured by first mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the Indenture of Mortgage or Deed of Trust, dated June 15, 1937, from the Company to The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "FIRST MORTGAGE").  Reference is made to the First Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of first mortgage bonds, under the First Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional first mortgage bonds may be issued.
 
So long as any of the Notes of this Series are outstanding, the Company will not optionally redeem, purchase or otherwise retire in full its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, and, therefore, the Release Date will not occur.
 
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date. Each Note issued upon transfer, exchange or substitution of such Note shall bear the Original Issue Date of such transferred, exchanged or substituted Note, as the case may be.
 
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time.  The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date will be equal to the greater of: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to and including the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 40 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below); plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to and including the redemption date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date.  The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed.  Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption
date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes of this Series.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY PRICE" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
 
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER" means (A) Barclays Capital Inc. and BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC or their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers in the United States (each, a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (B) any other Primary Treasury Dealer(s) selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
 
"REFERENCE TREASURY DEALER QUOTATIONS" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
 
Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (and for any partial periods shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months).  If any Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid is not a Business Day, then payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Interest Payment Date or date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid and, in the case of timely payment thereof, no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date or the date on which the principal of this Note is required to be paid.
 
The Company, at its option, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture, will be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the Notes (except for
certain obligations including obligations to register the transfer or exchange of Notes, replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes, maintain paying agencies and hold monies for payment in trust, all as set forth in the Indenture) if the Company deposits with the Trustee money, U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest thereon and principal thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money, or a combination of money and U.S. Government Obligations, in any event in an amount sufficient, without reinvestment, to pay all the principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes on the dates such payments are due in accordance with the terms of the Notes.
 
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of and interest on the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture and, upon such declaration, the Trustee shall demand the redemption of the Senior Note First Mortgage Bonds to the extent provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modifications of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Noteholders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
As set forth in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, no Holder of any Notes will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder unless such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to such Notes, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes affected by such Event of Default shall have made written request and offered reasonable indemnity to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee and the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of and any premium, or interest on, this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed here.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and to provisions of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium, and interest on, this Note at the times, places and rates and the coin or currency prescribed in the Indenture.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note may be transferred only as permitted by the legend hereto and the provisions of the Indenture.
 
The Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee, directly or through an Authenticating Agent by manual signature of an authorized officer, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture unless otherwise indicated herein.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.

In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company, we have reviewed originals (or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of the Registration Statement, the Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof, the Indenture, a specimen of the Notes, corporate and other documents, records and papers and certificates of public officials.  In connection with such review, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the conformity to the originals of the documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies, the authenticity of the originals of such documents and all documents submitted to us as originals and the correctness of all statements of fact contained in such original documents.  We have not reviewed the Notes, except a specimen thereof, and we have relied upon a certificate of the Trustee as to the authentication and delivery thereof under the Indenture.  We have not reviewed and are expressing no opinion or belief as to matters relating to titles to property, franchises or the nature, extent or priority of the lien purported to be created by the Company's first mortgage indenture or the recordation or perfection of such lien.  We are members of the Bar of the State of New York and, for purposes of this opinion, do not hold ourselves out as experts on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.  We have relied upon an opinion letter dated as of the date hereof of Steven R. Sullivan, Esq., Senior Vice President, General Counsel and
 
Secretary of the Company, with respect to the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Notes by the Company.
 
On the basis of such review, we are of the opinion that the Notes are the valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 23, 2009, which is deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.  In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
Very truly yours,
