ITEM 8.01  Other Events.
On June 5, 2009, Central Illinois Public Service Company, doing business as AmerenCIPS (CIPS), Central Illinois Light Company, doing business as AmerenCILCO (CILCO), and Illinois Power Company, doing business as AmerenIP (IP) (collectively, the Ameren Illinois Utilities), filed requests with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) seeking approval to increase their electric delivery service rates.  CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to increase their annual revenues from electric delivery service by $51 million, $28 million and $102 million, respectively. The electric rate increase requests are based on an 11.75 to 12.25 percent return on equity, a capital structure composed of 44 to 49 percent equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $2.4 billion, and a test year ended December 31, 2008.
 
Also on June 5, 2009, CIPS, CILCO and IP filed requests with the ICC seeking approval to increase their natural gas delivery service rates.  CIPS, CILCO and IP requested to increase their annual revenues from natural gas delivery service by $11 million, $9 million and $25 million, respectively.  The natural gas rate increase requests are based on an 11.25 to 11.60 percent return on equity, a capital structure composed of 44 to 49 percent equity, an aggregate rate base for the Ameren Illinois Utilities of $1.0 billion and a test year ended December 31, 2008.
The ICC proceedings relating to the proposed electric and natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months and decisions by the ICC in such proceedings are required by May 2010.  The Ameren Illinois Utilities cannot predict the level of any delivery service rate change the ICC may approve, when any rate change may go into effect, or whether any rate increase that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for the Ameren Illinois Utilities to recover their costs and earn a reasonable return on their investments when the increase goes into effect.  Attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference is the Ameren Illinois Utilities press release regarding their filings with the ICC.

Exhibit 99.1
 
    
 
Today, the Ameren Illinois Utilities (AmerenCIPS, AmerenCILCO, AmerenIP  subsidiaries of Ameren Corporation [NYSE: AEE])  took action to insure the utilities will continue to have the resources needed to provide a reliable, safe energy delivery system by requesting the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) to approve delivery service rate increases that are not expected to take effect before May 2010.
Peoria, Ill., (June 5, 2009) 
 
Customers rely on us to provide safe, efficient and reliable energy delivery service, as well as respond quickly and effectively to outages caused by storms and to repair damage caused to natural gas lines, said Scott A. Cisel, president and chief executive officer of the Ameren Illinois Utilities (AIU).
 
We understand todays economic challenges are affecting the people, businesses and industries we serve as well as our own organization. We recognize that any rate increase will be cause for concern. However, be assured that our proposed rate increases are necessary to provide the essential financial resources to meet our obligations to our customers.
 
We have strived to minimize the financial impact of the delivery service rate increases on our customers by significantly reducing our own operating costs without sacrificing our commitment to reliability and safety.
 
Because we are committed to openness and transparency, we are trying a new way of communicating rate information to our customers. The effect of the proposed delivery service rates on residential customers will be printed on bills for a one-month period, beginning in August. Furthermore, by visiting our Web site or calling customer service, our customers will be able to see how the new rates affect their bills for a full year, Cisel said.
 
The Ameren Illinois Utilities are continually working to maintain and strengthen their 46,000-mile electric distribution system and 18,000-mile natural gas distribution system to meet customer needs today and tomorrow.

To help meet the growing demand for energy while improving the reliability of the AIU distribution system, 77 percent  more than $173 million  of the $226 million rate increase request represents costs associated with the construction, operation and maintenance of the energy distribution system and the people who directly serve the customers.
 
Under the proposed rate plan, AmerenCIPS residential customers who use 10,000 kilowatt-hours (kWhs) of electricity a year will pay $59 more per year, however, those AmerenCIPS customers in the Metro East area will pay $65 more per year; AmerenCILCO customers will pay $64 more per year and AmerenIP customers will pay $97 more per year.
 
Under the new rate plan, all AmerenCIPS residential customers who use 785 therms of natural gas annually will pay $60 more per year, AmerenCILCO customers will pay $38 more per year and AmerenIP customers will pay $55 more per year.
 
The proposed rate increases affect the charges for delivering electricity and natural gas to customers. Delivery service rates vary between the three Ameren Illinois companies (AmerenCIPS, AmerenCILCO, AmerenIP) to reflect the actual cost of doing business at each of those companies. The actual cost of energy (electricity or natural gas) appears as a separate charge on bills. The Ameren Illinois Utilities do not earn a profit from the sale of the electricity or natural gas commodities.
Delivery Costs:
 
 
 Unlike most businesses, AIU is not allowed to immediately adjust customer rates to offset higher or unexpected operating expenses. AIU must borrow money to meet essential expenses. In order to recover higher costs, AIU must file rate increase cases, which normally take 11 months to complete.
Recovering Higher/Unexpected Costs:
 
AIU is committed to openness and transparency. Therefore, the effect of the new delivery service rates on residential customer bills will be published on bills for a one-month period, beginning in August. Also, you will be able to see the annual effect on your bills by visiting our rate topic specific Web site (). Customers also may call AmerenCIPS at 1-888-789-2466, AmerenCILCO at 1-888-672-5252 or AmerenIP at 1-800-755-5000.

Though not part of the delivery service rate increase request, Ameren Illinois Utilities customers today are paying less for the commodity electricity as a result of a sharp decline in the wholesale price of electricity announced on May 8, 2009. The new rates for electricity supply  shown as the Electric Supply charge on bills  mean a residential customer who uses 10,000 kWhs of electricity a year will save approximately $100 on the total annual electric bill for electricity used after June 1.
Lower Electric/Gas Supply Costs:
 
 
Also, the cost of the commodity natural gas paid by customers has dropped by an average of 76 cents per therm since peaking last October. The cost of natural gas supply is shown as the Gas Charge or PGA (purchased gas adjustment) on bills.
 
 
 
 
ADD-2
The actual cost of energy (electricity and natural gas commodities) appears as a separate charge on customer bills. The Ameren Illinois Utilities do not profit from the sale of electricity and natural gas commodities.
 
Under Illinois law, up to 4 percent of the electricity we deliver this year will come from renewable sources, primarily wind generated power. In surveys many customers have said they would like the option of being able to purchase renewable energy credits (RECs) at a modest price. Each REC represents the green attributes of 1,000 kWhs of electricity produced from renewable energy resources.
Going Green:
 
 
In todays rate filings, AIU is asking the ICC to approve the Voluntary Green Program (VGP). Residential customers will have the option of contributing as little as $3 more per month to participate. AIU will use the proceeds from the program to purchase RECs on behalf of program participants. The program is strictly voluntary.
 
Individuals and businesses alike are learning and applying the principles of energy efficiency and conservation. As your utility, we are helping you spend less on energy by using less without sacrificing personal comfort.
Use Less, Spend Less:
 
 
Launched in 2008, our Act On Energy () initiative has become a primary source of energy savings information, as well as significant financial incentives for residential and business customers. By the end of our first program year, our compact fluorescent light (CFL) program could reduce residential customer electric bills by as much as $4.5 million per year, while our business programs have cut their annual electric bills by at least $4 million.

Ameren Illinois Utilities customers also have the option of enrolling in the Power Smart Pricing Program. Administered by CNT Energy, Power Smart Pricing allows customers to pay the hourly wholesale price of electricity rather than a fixed rate, giving them another tool to better manage their energy bills. For more information, visit the Web site or call CNT Energy at 1-877-655-6028.

 Aggressive cost containment is a priority at AIU. For example, nearly $28 million has been saved this year by postponing vehicle purchases, deferring facility construction, curtailing hiring, cutting travel and scaling back budgets.
Cutting Costs:
 
The Ameren Illinois Utilities (AmerenCIPS, AmerenCILCO, AmerenIP) have been providing safe, reliable energy delivery service for more than a century. The Ameren Illinois Utilities deliver energy to 1.2 million electric and 840,000 natural gas customers in more than 1,200 communities within a 43,700-square-mile service territory, while helping you spend less by using less through our  initiative.
