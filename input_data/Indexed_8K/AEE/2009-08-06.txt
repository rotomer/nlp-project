FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
AMEREN ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2009 EARNINGS
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Aug. 6, 2009Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second  quarter 2009 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $165 million, or 77 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2008 GAAP net income of $206 million, or 98 cents per share.  Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded second quarter 2009 core (non-GAAP) net income of $161 million, or 75 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2008 core (non-GAAP) net income of $142 million, or 67 cents per share.
 
The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings per share in the second quarter of 2009 over the same period in 2008 was principally because of new utility service rates in Illinois, effective October 1, 2008, and in Missouri, effective March 1, 2009, as well as lower plant operations and maintenance expenses and warmer weather.  The favorable earnings impact of the above factors was reduced by higher net fuel costs and the absence this year of the 2008 portion of a lump-sum payment from a coal supplier received last year as a result of the premature closure of a mine and the termination of a contract, among other items.
 
 I am pleased to report that our second quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, and the companys strong operating performance allows me to reaffirm our core 2009 earnings guidance of $2.70 to $3.05 per share, said Thomas R. Voss, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation.  Rate relief, cost control and actions taken to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations in the wholesale energy markets are helping us weather difficult economic and market conditions in 2009.
 
We are realizing the benefits from steps we took, beginning in late 2008, to reduce our planned capital and operations and maintenance costs, Voss added.  As we look ahead to 2010 and beyond, we are identifying further opportunities to tighten our belt for the good of all stakeholders.  In total, we have identified approximately $2 billion of opportunities to reduce capital expenditures for

2010 through 2013, as compared to earlier plans.  Notably, in our non-rate-regulated, or merchant, generation business, we have eliminated approximately $1 billion of planned capital expenditures from this period.  In our regulated businesses, we have also identified and are carefully evaluating projects that may be eliminated or deferred to help our customers manage their costs in these tough economic times and further strengthen our financial profile.  However, we will not reduce costs to a level that would prevent us from providing safe and reliable service.  We are also looking carefully at planned operations and maintenance expenditures across our organization, but especially in our merchant generation business and business support functions.  We are aggressively managing power plant outage and labor costs, among other things.  Our objective is to significantly lower 2010 non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, relative to the 2008 level, in our merchant generation business.
 
In the second quarter of 2009, warmer weather contributed to a 4% increase in kilowatthour sales to residential customers and a 1% increase in kilowatthour sales to commercial customers, compared to the year-ago quarter.  On a weather-normalized basis, Ameren estimates that second quarter 2009 residential and commercial kilowatthour sales were virtually unchanged from the year-ago period.  The slowing economy continued to affect the level of regulated electric sales to industrial customers, resulting in a 13% decline from the year-ago quarter, excluding the impact of reduced demand from AmerenUEs largest customer, the Noranda Aluminum, Inc., smelter plant in New Madrid, Missouri.  Norandas plant sustained damage because of a power interruption on non-Ameren-owned power lines during a severe January 2009 ice storm.  Including Noranda, regulated industrial electric sales declined 17% in the second quarter of 2009, as compared to the year-ago quarter.
 
Despite solid operating performance, second quarter 2009 merchant generation output declined 4%, compared to the year-ago quarter, as lower power prices reduced the periods of time when the plants could profitably sell power in the open market.  However, the segments core earnings were not significantly affected due to proactive forward hedges of 2009 generation in prior years at higher-than-current market prices.
 
The following items are excluded from second quarter 2009 and second quarter 2008 core (non-GAAP) earnings, as applicable:
 
  
The net effects of mark-to-market activity increased net income by $8 million in the second quarter of 2009 and by $48 million in the second quarter of 2008.

Net income in accordance with GAAP for the first six months of 2009 was $306 million, or $1.43 per share, compared to $344 million, or $1.64 per share, in the first half of 2008.  Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded first half 2009 core (non-GAAP) net income of $275 million, or $1.29 per share, compared to first half 2008 core (non-GAAP) net income of $276 million, or $1.31 per share.  A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
 
2009 Earnings Guidance
 
Ameren also announced today that it has reaffirmed its expectations for full-year 2009 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings.  GAAP earnings for 2009 continue to be expected in the range of $2.63 to $2.98 per share, and core (non-GAAP) earnings continue to be expected in the range of $2.70 to $3.05 per share.  GAAP and core (non-GAAP) guidance includes the estimated effect on earnings of cooler-than-normal July 2009 weather.  An estimated 7 cents per share negative impact in 2009 from the 2007 settlement agreement among parties in Illinois to provide comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance is excluded from core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance.  Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will affect GAAP earnings, but are excluded from GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses.

These estimated segment contributions have been updated to reflect revised load and revenue forecasts and Julys mild weather, among other things.
 
Amerens earnings guidance for 2009 assumes normal weather for the balance of the year and is subject to, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions, plant operations, energy and capital and credit market conditions, economic conditions, severe storms, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses, and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
 
Missouri Regulated Segment Earnings
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the second quarter of 2009 were $80 million, comparable to year-ago results.  The primary factors positively impacting second quarter 2009 earnings as compared to the year-ago period were higher electric rates, effective March 1, 2009, warmer 2009 weather and lower plant operations and maintenance costs.  These factors were offset by higher net fuel costs, lower electric margins as a result of reduced industrial load, including lower sales to the Noranda Aluminum smelter plant, and higher financing and depreciation and amortization expenses.  Missouri regulated operations recorded GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2009 of $82 million, $40 million less than in the second quarter of 2008.  The GAAP earnings decrease was the result of reduced income from net mark-to-market activity, which in the prior-year period included gains on non-qualifying hedges of transportation costs, and the previously-mentioned benefit, in the second quarter of 2008, of the accounting order from the Missouri Public Service Commission related to 2007 severe storm costs.
 
Illinois Regulated Segment Earnings
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the second quarter of 2009 were $17 million versus a loss of $9 million in the second quarter of 2008.  This earnings improvement was primarily due to higher electric and natural gas delivery service rates, effective October 1, 2008.  The increase was offset by higher storm restoration, financing and depreciation and amortization expenses, among other things.  Illinois regulated operations recorded GAAP earnings in the second quarter of 2009 of $15 million versus a loss of $14 million in the second quarter of 2008.  In addition to the items noted above, this GAAP

earnings increase was primarily due to lower costs in 2009 related to the 2007 Illinois electric settlement agreement.
 
Merchant Generation Segment Earnings
 
Core (non-GAAP) earnings in the second quarter of 2009 were $73 million, down from $77 million earned in the second quarter of 2008.  This decline reflected the absence this year of the previously mentioned 2008 portion of a lump-sum payment from a coal supplier, which increased the year-ago period core earnings by $21 million.  In addition, merchant generation operations incurred higher financing and depreciation and amortization expenses, which were only partly offset by lower plant operations and maintenance costs.  While market prices for power were substantially lower in the second quarter of 2009, as compared to the year-ago period, the segments core earnings were not significantly affected because of proactive forward physical and financial hedges of 2009 generation in prior years at higher-than-current market prices.  GAAP earnings from merchant generation operations in the second quarter of 2009 were $75 million, down from $98 million in the second quarter of 2008.  In addition to the items noted above, this decline in GAAP earnings was driven by the absence of the previously-mentioned 2009 portion of a lump-sum payment from a coal supplier recorded in 2008 and reduced income from net mark-to-market activity, partially offset by lower costs related to the 2007 Illinois electric settlement agreement.

Regulation G Statement
 
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Amerens total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance excludes one or more of the following:  the earnings impact of the settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance, net mark-to-market gains or losses, the 2009 portion of a 2008 lump-sum payment from a coal supplier for expected higher fuel costs in 2009 as a result of the premature closure of a mine and termination of a contract, and the estimated minimum benefit of an accounting order from the Missouri Public Service Commission associated with the 2007 storm costs. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes it allows it to more accurately compare the companys ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP for certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
