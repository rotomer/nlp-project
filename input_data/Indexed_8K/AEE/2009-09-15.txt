the Registration Statement, as of the date of filing of the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as of the date each was filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act (in each case, other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; although such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except for those referred to in the opinion in subsection (xii) of this Section 7(c) and those that relate to such counsel, such counsel has no reason to believe that (1) the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of the latest date as of which any part of the Registration Statement is deemed to have become effective under the 1933 Act in accordance with Section 11(d) of the 1933 Act and Rule 430B under the 1933 Act, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (2) the Pricing Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), at the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (3) the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of its date or on the date of such opinion, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; the Registration Statement has become, and as of the date of such opinion is, effective under the 1933 Act; any required filing of each Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the 1933 Act has been made in the manner and within the time period required by the applicable paragraph of such Rule 424(b); any required filing of the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, pursuant to Rule 433 under the 1933 Act, has been made in the manner and within the time period required by such Rule 433; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened under Section 8 or Section 8A of the 1933 Act.
 
Such opinion shall also state that such counsel has no knowledge of any litigation, pending or threatened, that challenges the validity of the Securities or this Agreement, or that seeks to enjoin the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder or that might reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect except as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may (i) state that such opinion is limited to matters covered by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Missouri and (ii) rely as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.  Such counsel's opinion may further state that it is addressed to the
Representatives
and is rendered solely for their benefit and the benefit of the other Underwriters and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person (other than Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP as to certain matters involving the application of the laws of the State of Missouri in their respective opinions to the
Representatives
on the date of such opinion) without such counsel's prior written consent.

Representatives
an opinion, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Representatives
, with respect to the matters covered in paragraphs (vi), (vii), (viii), (x), (xi), (xii) and (xiv) of Section 7(c) above, as well as such other related matters as the

In rendering such opinions, such counsel may (i) state that such opinions are limited to matters covered by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Missouri and (ii) rely (A) as to matters involving the application of the laws of the State of Missouri, upon the opinion of Steven R. Sullivan, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, rendered pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.

Representatives
, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
(k)

Indemnification and Contribution
.
 
(a)
                                 
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as and when incurred, to which such Underwriter may become subject, joint or several, under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof), arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission
 
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will promptly reimburse such Underwriter for any reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses for no more than one law firm for the Underwriters) when and as incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to an Underwriter to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by an Underwriter through the
provided, however,
Representatives
expressly for use therein.
 
(b)
                                
Each Underwriter, severally, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which the Company may become subject, under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the
Representatives
expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses for no more than one law firm for the Company) when and as incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
 
(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability that it may have to any such indemnified party otherwise than under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof.  In case any such action shall be brought against any such indemnified party and it shall notify such indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of such indemnified party, be counsel to such indemnifying party), and, after notice from such indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the indemnifying party's expense and to
control its defense of such action if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party agree to the retention of that counsel, (ii) the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of such action in a timely manner or (iii) the indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party or another indemnified party.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (x) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (y) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each such indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by such an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
pro rata
statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
                                 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee, agent or other representative and to each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee, agent or other representative and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act.

The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives or controlling persons, or the Company, any officer or director of the Company who signed the Registration Statement or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Default by an Underwriter
.
 
(a)
                                 
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the
Representatives
may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the
Representatives do
not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the
Representatives
to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the
Representatives notify
the Company
that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the
Representatives
that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the
Representatives
or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or the applicable Date of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the
Representatives
may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 11 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)
                                
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives
and the Company as provided in Section 11(a) hereof, the number of such Securities which remains unpurchased on the Closing Date or the applicable Date of Delivery does not exceed one-eleventh of the number of all the Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date or such Date of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing Date or such Date of Delivery and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing Date or such Date of Delivery) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)
                                 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives
and the Company as provided in Section 11(a) hereof, the number of such Securities which remains unpurchased on the Closing Date or the applicable Date of Delivery exceeds one-eleventh of the number of all the Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date or such Date of Delivery, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 11(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to such Date of Delivery, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase, and the Company to sell, the applicable Option Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

Termination
.
                            
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 11 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, including if any of the conditions in Section 7 hereof have not been fulfilled, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein or the Company does not comply with its other obligations as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of Underwriters' Counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
13.
                                
Absence of Fiduciary Duty
.
  The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person.  Additionally, neither the
Representatives
nor any other Underwriters are advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby.  The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.  Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

Re:

Dear Sirs:
 
The undersigned, a stockholder of Ameren Corporation, a Missouri corporation (the "Company"), understands that Barclays Capital Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the "Lead Representatives") propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with the Company, on behalf of the other underwriters named therein, providing for the public offering of shares (the "Securities") of the Company's common stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock").  In recognition of the benefit that such an offering will confer upon the undersigned as a stockholder and an officer and/or director of the Company, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned agrees with each underwriter named in the Underwriting Agreement that, during a period of 60 days from the date of the Underwriting Agreement, the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of the Lead Representatives, directly or indirectly, (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by the undersigned or with respect to which the undersigned has or hereafter acquires the power of disposition, or file any registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to any of the foregoing or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise.
 
 
 
Exhibit B
 
Pursuant to Section 7(e) of the Underwriting Agreement, the Accountants shall furnish letters to the Underwriters substantially to the effect that:
 
(i)            they are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ();
PCAOB
 
(ii)           in their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC;
 
(iii)          they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the PCAOB of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference into the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus;
 
(iv)          they have compared
the ratios of earnings to fixed charges in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K
;
 
(v)           on the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (i) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC;
 
(vi)          nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that (i) at [                   ], there was any
change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including current maturities of long-term debt), increase in short-term debt or decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity
of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the
[                   ]
unaudited consolidated balance sheet
included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus
, or (ii) for the period from
[                   ]
to
[                   ]
, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or in the total or per-share amounts of net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the
Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus
disclose have occurred or may occur and except
such other decreases as may be specified in such letter
;
 
(vii)        
officials of the Company have advised them that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to
[                   ]
are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by them with respect to changes in financial statement items after
[                   ]
have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in paragraph (v).  They have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at
[                   ]
there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including current maturities of long-term debt), increase in short-term debt or decrease in consolidated net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity of the Company and subsidiaries as compared with amounts shown in the
[                   ]
unaudited consolidated balance sheet
included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus
; or (b) for the period from
[                   ]
to
[                   ]
, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or in the total or per-share amounts in net income.  Those officials referred to above stated that they cannot comment on any decreases in  consolidated net current assets (working capital) or increases or decreases in stockholders' equity, consolidated operating revenues, or in total or per-share amounts of net income for the period referred to above.  On the basis of these inquiries and their reading of the minutes as described in paragraph (v), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that there was any such change in capital stock or increase in long-term debt (including current maturities of long-term debt), or increase in short-term debt, except in all instances for changes or increases which the
Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus
disclose have occurred or may occur.
 
(viii)        in addition to the examination referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraph (v) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.
 
All references in this Exhibit B to the Pricing Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Pricing Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) included with the Pricing Disclosure Package (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Underwriting Agreement for purposes of such letter.
