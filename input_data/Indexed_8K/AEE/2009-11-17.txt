At the Time of Delivery, Steven R. Sullivan, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, shall have furnished to the
Representatives
an opinion, dated the Time of Delivery, in form and substance satisfactory to the
Representatives
, substantially to the effect that:
 
(i)
           
other than as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company is a party or of which any property of the Company is the subject that, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and, to such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or others; and the statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and
 
the Prospectus describing any legal proceedings or material contracts or agreements relating to the Company fairly summarize such matters;
 
(ii)
          
the Company is not, and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the net proceeds thereof, will not be, an "investment company," or an entity "controlled" by an investment company, as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
 
(iii)
         
the Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act;
 
(iv)
         
to the best of my knowledge, each contract or document material to the Company described in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus is in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except where a failure to be in full force and effect would not cause a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(v)
          
the statements set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Senior Notes" and "Description of the Senior Debt Securities and the Indenture," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities and the Indenture, and under the captions "Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting" (except with respect to the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth complete paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting," upon which such counsel need not pass), insofar as such statements summarize legal matters, agreements, documents or proceedings discussed therein, are accurate and fair summaries of such legal matters, agreements, documents or proceedings in all material respects;
 
(vi)
         
the documents incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they were filed with the SEC complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder;

the FERC Order is in full force and effect and is sufficient to authorize the transactions contemplated by the Agreement to the extent authorization is required; no other consent, approval, authorization, order, registration, filing or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body of the United States of America is legally required to be obtained for the issue and sale of the Securities by the Company, or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the 1933 Act and the 1939 Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations, filings or qualifications as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as to which counsel need not express an opinion.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that such opinion is limited to matters covered by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Missouri and rely as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.  Such counsel's opinion may further state that it is addressed to the
Representatives
and is rendered solely for their benefit and the benefit of the other Underwriters and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person without such counsel's prior written consent.

, with respect to the matters
 
covered in paragraphs (iii), (iv), (v) and (vii) (with respect to the State of New York) of subsection (c)(1) above and paragraphs (ii), (iii), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of subsection (c)(2) above, as well as such other related matters as the
Representatives
may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.  In addition, such counsel shall opine that the statements set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," to the extent that they purport to constitute summaries of matters of law or regulation or legal conclusions, are accurate and fair in all material respects.

Representatives
, so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
(g)

Representatives
, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
(i)
           
On or prior to the Time of Delivery, the
Representatives

(l)
           
The FERC Order shall be in full force and effect at the Time of Delivery.
 
(m)

Representatives
pursuant to this Agreement, the performance of any of the covenants of the Company, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions herein contained.  All proceedings taken by the Company at or prior to the Time of Delivery in connection with the authorization, issuance and sale of the Securities as contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the execution of this Agreement, shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the
Representatives
and Underwriters' Counsel.
 
In case any of the conditions specified above in this Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the
Representatives
upon mailing or
 
otherwise delivering written notice thereof to the Company.  Any such termination shall be without liability of either party to the other party except as otherwise provided in Section 7 hereof and except for any liability under Section 9 hereof.
 
9.
            
(a)
          
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as and when incurred, to which such Underwriter may become subject, joint or several, under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof), arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the 1933 Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will promptly reimburse such Underwriter for any reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses for no more than one law firm for the Underwriters) when and as incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to an Underwriter to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by an Underwriter through the
provided, however,
Representatives
expressly for use therein.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter, severally, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses to which the Company may become subject, under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the
Representatives
expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses for no more than one law firm for the Company) when and as incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any
 
liability that it may have to any such indemnified party otherwise than under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof.  In case any such action shall be brought against any such indemnified party and it shall notify such indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of such indemnified party, be counsel to such indemnifying party), and, after notice from such indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the indemnifying party's expense and to control its defense of such action if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party agree to the retention of that counsel, (ii) the indemnifying party does not assume the defense of such action in a timely manner or (iii) the indemnified party reasonably objects to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party or another indemnified party.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (x) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (y) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under Section 9(a) or 9(b) hereof shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 9(c) hereof, then each such indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
 
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(d).  The amount paid or payable by such an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by such Underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. 
pro rata
The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 9(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
          
The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee, agent or other representative and to each person, if any, who controls each Underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director, employee, agent or other representative and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act.
 
10.
          
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives or controlling persons, or the Company, any officer or director of the Company who signed the Registration Statement or any controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
11.
          
All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication.  Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to Barclays Capital Inc., 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Registration, facsimile: (646) 834-8133, Morgan Stanley & Co.

12.
          
(a)
          
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the
Representatives
may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the
Representatives do
not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the
Representatives
to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the
Representatives notify
the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the
Representatives
that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the
Representatives
or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the
Representatives
may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 12 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)
          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives
and the Company as provided in Section 12(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)
          
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives
and the Company as provided in Section 12(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 12(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
13.
          
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 12 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, including if any of the conditions in Section 8 hereof have not been fulfilled, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein or the Company does not comply with its other obligations as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of Underwriters' Counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for
 
the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
14.
          
The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person.  Additionally, neither the
Representatives
nor any other Underwriters are advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby.  The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto.  Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
 
15.
          
The rights and duties of the parties to this Agreement shall, pursuant to New York General Obligations Law Section 5-1401, be governed by the law of the State of New York.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Company and the Underwriters except to the extent provided in Section 9(e) hereof, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.  No person who purchases any of the Securities from the Underwriters shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.  This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 
Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.  As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the SEC's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 
The word "or" shall not be exclusive, and all references in this Agreement to the words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section or subdivision hereof, and the captions to such Sections and subdivisions are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.  The Company is authorized, subject to applicable law, to disclose any and all aspects of this potential transaction that are necessary to support any U.S. federal or state income tax benefits expected to be claimed with respect to such transaction, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to the Company the enclosed duplicate hereof, whereupon this Agreement will become a binding agreement between the Company and the Underwriters in accordance with its terms.

in their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC;
 
(iii)
         
they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the PCAOB of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference into the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus;
 
(iv)
         
they have compared
the ratios of earnings to fixed charges in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K
;
 
(v)
          
on the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiary since the date of the latest Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiary responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (i) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1934 Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC;
 
(vi)
         
nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that (i) at [              ], there was any
change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable) or decrease in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the
[                   ]

, or (ii) for the period from

decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the
Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus
disclose have occurred or may occur and except
such other decreases as may be specified in such letter
;
 
(vii)
        
officials of the Company have advised them that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to
[                   ]
are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by them with respect to changes in financial statement items after
[                   ]
have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in paragraph (v).  They have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at
[                   ]
there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable) or decrease in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the
[                   ]
unaudited consolidated balance sheet
included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended [                   ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus
; or (b) for the period from
[                   ]
to
[                   ]
, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or net income.  Those officials referred to above stated that they cannot comment on any decreases in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity at
[                   ]
compared to
[                   ]
, or decreases as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year in consolidated operating revenues or net income for the period from
[                   ]
to
[                   ]
.  On the basis of these inquiries and their reading of the minutes as described in paragraph (v), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that there was any such change in capital stock or increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable), except in all instances for changes or increases which the
Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus
disclose have occurred or may occur.
 
(viii)
       
in addition to the examination referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraph (v) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiary, which appear in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiary and have found them to be in agreement.
