FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ST. LOUIS, MO., Aug. 5, 2010Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second quarter 2010 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $152 million, or 64 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2009 GAAP net income of $165 million, or 77 cents per share. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded second quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) net income of $173 million, or 73 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2009 core (non-GAAP) net income of $161 million, or 75 cents per share.
"I am pleased to report that second quarter earnings exceeded our expectations and reflect both strong electricity sales and disciplined management of our costs," said Thomas R. Voss, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. "We are raising our 2010 earnings expectations to reflect year-to-date results and our continued tight controls on costs. Our utilities are focused on aligning spending with rate case outcomes and narrowing the gap between our earned and allowed rates of return. Our merchant generation segment also continues to aggressively manage costs. Further, we are maintaining our commitment to operate safely and reliably."
Sales of electricity to native load utility customers increased 9% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to sales in the second quarter of 2009. The higher sales reflected a recovering economy, the return to full capacity, in March 2010, of a large customer's aluminum smelter plant and warmer summer weather. Kilowatthour sales to industrial customers rose 26% and 17% excluding sales to the smelter plant. Sales to residential customers rose 4%, and sales to commercial customers rose 1%. Merchant generation revenues and margins in the second quarter of 2010 were lower than those in the second quarter of 2009 as a result of lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs.
Operations and maintenance expenses decreased, compared to those incurred in the second quarter of 2009, despite a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Nuclear

Plant. The Callaway Plant did not have a refueling outage in 2009. The reduced expenses are attributable to disciplined cost management across all business segments. In addition, financing costs declined reflecting increased regulatory recovery of such costs. The impact on earnings per share of these positive factors was offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses as a result of infrastructure investment and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding, largely due to the September 2009 stock issuance.
The following items, as applicable, were excluded from second quarter 2010 and second quarter 2009 core (non-GAAP) earnings:
 
Net income in accordance with GAAP for the six months ended June 30, 2010, was $254 million, or $1.07 per share, compared to $306 million, or $1.43 per share, for the same period in 2009. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded six-month 2010 core (non-GAAP) net income of $268 million, or $1.13 per share, compared to six-month 2009 core (non-GAAP) net income of $275 million, or $1.29 per share. A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
2010 Earnings Guidance
Ameren has raised its 2010 earnings guidance to reflect year-to-date earnings and continued disciplined cost management. The company now expects GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.20 to $2.60 per share.

Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings but are excluded from GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses.
Ameren expects its business segments to provide the following contributions to 2010 earnings per share:
 
Ameren's earnings guidance for 2010 assumes normal weather for the second half of the year and is subject to the effects of, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions, plant operations, energy and capital and credit market conditions, economic conditions, severe storms, unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses, and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
Missouri Regulated Segment Earnings
Core (non-GAAP) earnings for the Missouri regulated operations were $114 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $80 million in the second quarter of 2009. The improvement in core (non-GAAP) earnings was primarily due to a 9% increase in electricity sales to native load customers as a result of warmer summer weather, a recovering economy and the return to full capacity of the segment's largest customer, the Noranda Aluminum smelter plant. In addition, financing costs declined reflecting increased regulatory recovery of such costs. Further, non-plant operations and maintenance expenses were lower due to disciplined cost management. The impact of these positive factors was reduced by higher plant operations and maintenance expenses reflecting the previously discussed refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Nuclear Plant. GAAP earnings were $113 million in the second quarter of 2010 versus $82 million in the second quarter of 2009. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above and also by a loss from net unrealized mark-to-market activity recorded in the second quarter of 2010 versus a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
Illinois Regulated Segment Earnings
Core (non-GAAP) earnings for the Illinois regulated operations were $46 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $17 million in the second quarter of 2009. The improvement in core (non-GAAP) earnings was primarily due to a 9% increase in electricity sales as a result of a

recovering economy and warmer summer weather. Earnings also benefited from significantly lower storm-related costs, aggressive cost management and increased electric delivery rates. GAAP earnings were $46 million in the second quarter of 2010 versus $15 million in the second quarter of 2009. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above and also by a second quarter 2009 charge related to the Illinois electric settlement agreement reached in 2007.
Merchant Generation Segment Earnings
Core (non-GAAP) earnings for the merchant generation operations were $17 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $73 million in the second quarter of 2009. The decline in core (non-GAAP) earnings was largely due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs. In addition, financing and depreciation expenses increased. The impact of these factors was mitigated by reduced operations and maintenance expenses reflecting aggressive cost management. GAAP losses were $2 million in the second quarter of 2010 versus GAAP earnings of $75 million in the second quarter of 2009. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above and also by a loss from net unrealized mark-to-market activity in the second quarter of 2010, compared to a gain in the second quarter of 2009, and a second quarter 2009 charge related to the Illinois electric settlement agreement reached in 2007.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Ameren's total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance excludes one or more of the following: net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses and the earnings impact of the 2007 settlement agreement among parties in Illinois for comprehensive electric rate relief and customer assistance. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes it allows it to more accurately compare the company's ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP for certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
