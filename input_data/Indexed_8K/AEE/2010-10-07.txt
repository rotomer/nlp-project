On October 1, 2010, Central Illinois Public Service Company ("CIPS"), Central Illinois Light Company ("CILCO") and Illinois Power Company ("IP") completed the previously announced merger whereby CILCO and IP merged with and into CIPS, with CIPS as the surviving entity (the "Merger"), pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of April 13, 2010, among CIPS, CILCO and IP. Upon consummation of the Merger, CIPS' name was changed to "Ameren Illinois Company" ("Ameren Illinois") and the separate legal existence of CILCO and IP terminated. Prior to the Merger, each of CIPS, CILCO and IP was a registrant subsidiary of Ameren Corporation ("Ameren").
In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, (i) all shares of CILCO and IP common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, all of which were owned by Ameren, were cancelled without payment, (ii) all shares of each series of IP preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger were automatically converted into shares of a newly created series of Ameren Illinois preferred stock having the same payment and redemption terms as the existing series of IP preferred stock, except to the extent that IP preferred shareholders exercised their dissenters' rights in accordance with Illinois law, and (iii) each outstanding share of CIPS common and preferred stock remains outstanding, except to the extent that CIPS preferred shareholders exercised their dissenters' rights in accordance with Illinois law. No fractional shares of Ameren Illinois preferred stock were issued in the Merger. Holders of IP preferred stock prior to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Ameren Illinois preferred stock as a result of the Merger will receive cash in lieu of such fractional shares, as determined in accordance with the Agreement. Prior to the Merger, but after consenting to the Merger, Ameren contributed to the capital of IP, without the payment of any consideration, all of the IP preferred stock owned by Ameren.
The foregoing description of the Agreement and the Merger is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which was previously filed as Annex A to Part I of CIPS' Registration Statement on Form S-4, File No. 333-166095, and is incorporated herein by reference.
On October 1, 2010, subsequent to the consummation of the Merger, Ameren Illinois distributed all of the shares of common stock of AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company ("AERG") owned by Ameren Illinois to Ameren, and Ameren subsequently contributed such shares of common stock to its subsidiary, Ameren Energy Resources Company LLC. The distribution was accounted for as a spin-off. Ameren Illinois transferred AERG to Ameren based on AERG's carrying value.

Interest on overdue principal, premium, if any, and, to the extent permitted by law, on overdue interest, shall be payable at the interest rate payable on the 2028 Notes. Interest on this Note is payable on the same dates as interest on the 2028 Notes is paid, until the principal sum of this Note is paid in full. Pursuant to Article XVI of the CIPS Indenture, this Note is issued to the CIPS Trustee to secure any and all obligations of the Company under the 2028 Notes and any other series of senior notes from time to time outstanding under the CIPS Indenture. Payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the 2028 Notes shall constitute payments on this Note as further provided herein and in the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 2010 (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to which this Note has been issued.

For purposes of Section 16.09 of the CIPS Indenture, this Note shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of IP Senior Notes" in respect of the 2028 Notes.
This Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or become valid or obligatory for any purpose, until the form of certificate endorsed hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as the trustee under the Indenture, or a successor trustee thereto under the Indenture (the "Trustee").
The provisions of this Note are continued on the reverse hereof and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.

(the "Trustee", which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture) and all indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "Indenture"). This Note is one of a series designated as the Series CIPS-AA Notes of the Company, unlimited in aggregate principal amount, issued under and secured by the Indenture and described in the Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 2010 (the "Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 2010" ), between the Company and the Trustee, supplemental to the Indenture. Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered.
 
The Notes will be secured by mortgage bonds (the "Senior Note Mortgage Bonds") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Illinois Power Company (now the Company) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Mortgage Trustee"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "Mortgage"). Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of mortgage bonds, under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional mortgage bonds may be issued.
This Series CIPS-AA Note is subject to redemption in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 2010.
This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of said State without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur, the principal of all Notes at any such time outstanding under the Indenture may be declared or may become due and payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that such declaration may be rescinded under certain circumstances.
Section 4.1 The Series CIPS-AA Notes are not redeemable except on the date, in the principal amount and for the redemption price that correspond to the redemption date for, the principal amount to be redeemed of, and the redemption price for, the 2028 Notes, and except as set forth in Section 2 of this Article.
In the event that the Company redeems any 2028 Notes prior to maturity in accordance with the provisions of the CIPS Indenture, the CIPS Trustee shall on the same date deliver to the Company the Series CIPS-AA Notes in principal amount corresponding to the 2028 Notes so redeemed, as provided in Section 16.08 of the CIPS Indenture. The Company agrees to give the Trustee notice of any such redemption of the 2028 Notes on or before the date fixed for any such redemption.
Section 4.2 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the CIPS Indenture (as defined therein) and the acceleration of the 2028 Notes, the Series CIPS-AA Notes shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of a written demand (hereinafter called a "2028 Redemption Demand") from the CIPS Trustee stating that there has occurred under the CIPS Indenture both an Event of Default and a declaration of acceleration of payment of principal, accrued interest and premium, if any, on the 2028 Notes specifying the last date to which interest on such 2028 Notes has been paid (such date being hereinafter referred to as the "2028 Initial Interest Accrual Date") and demanding redemption of the Series CIPS-AA Notes. The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture. Upon surrender of the Series CIPS-AA Notes by the CIPS Trustee to the Trustee, the Series CIPS-AA Notes shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon from the 2028 Initial Interest Accrual Date to the redemption date; provided, however, that in the event of a rescission or annulment of acceleration of the 2028 Notes pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 8.01(a) of the CIPS Indenture, then any 2028 Redemption Demand shall thereby be deemed to be rescinded by the CIPS Trustee although no such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 5.1 The Company hereby exercises the right to obtain the authentication of $60,000,000 principal amount of additional Notes pursuant to the terms of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, all of which shall be Series CIPS-AA Notes. The principal amount of the Series CIPS-AA Notes outstanding from time to time shall always be equal to the principal amount of the 2028 Notes which are outstanding from time to time under the CIPS Indenture and to the extent the CIPS Trustee holds Series CIPS-AA Notes in excess of such principal amount, such Series CIPS-AA Notes shall be deemed cancelled and retired and no longer outstanding under the Indenture.
Section 5.2 For purposes of Section 16.09 of the CIPS Indenture, the Series CIPS-AA Notes shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of IP Senior Notes" in respect of the 2028 Notes.
Section 6.1 The Company hereby creates a new series of Bonds to be known as "Senior Notes Series CIPS-BB" (the "Series CIPS-BB Notes").

The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 2011 Notes, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing sentence unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the CIPS Trustee signed by one of its officers stating (i) the timely payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest on, the 2011 Notes has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the CIPS Trustee pursuant to the CIPS Indenture, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.

Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this series. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered.
The Notes will be secured by mortgage bonds (the "Senior Note Mortgage Bonds") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Illinois Power Company (now the Company) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Mortgage Trustee"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "Mortgage").

This Series CIPS-BB Note is subject to redemption in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 2010.
This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of said State without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur, the principal of all Notes at any such time outstanding under the Indenture may be declared or may become due and payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that such declaration may be rescinded under certain circumstances.
Section 7.1 The Series CIPS-BB Notes are not redeemable except on the date, in the principal amount and for the redemption price that correspond to the redemption date for, the principal amount to be redeemed of, and the redemption price for, the 2011 Notes, and except as set forth in Section 2 of this Article.
In the event that the Company redeems any 2011 Notes prior to maturity in accordance with the provisions of the CIPS Indenture, the CIPS Trustee shall on the same date deliver to the Company the Series CIPS-BB Notes in principal amount corresponding to the 2011 Notes so redeemed, as provided in Section 16.08 of the CIPS Indenture. The Company agrees to give the Trustee notice of any such redemption of the 2011 Notes on or before the date fixed for any such redemption.
Section 7.2 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the CIPS Indenture (as defined therein) and the acceleration of the 2011 Notes, the Series CIPS-BB Notes shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of a written demand (hereinafter called a "2011 Redemption Demand") from the CIPS Trustee stating that there has occurred under the CIPS Indenture both an Event of Default and a declaration of acceleration of payment of principal, accrued interest and premium, if any, on the 2011 Notes specifying the last date to which interest on such 2011 Notes has been paid (such date being hereinafter referred to as the "2011 Initial Interest Accrual Date") and demanding redemption of the Series CIPS-BB Notes. The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture. Upon surrender of the Series CIPS-BB Notes by the CIPS Trustee to the Trustee, the Series CIPS-BB Notes shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon from the 2011 Initial Interest Accrual Date to the redemption date; provided, however, that in the event of a rescission or annulment of acceleration of the 2011 Notes pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 8.01(a) of the CIPS Indenture, then any 2011 Redemption Demand shall thereby be deemed to be rescinded by the CIPS Trustee although no such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 8.1 The Company hereby exercises the right to obtain the authentication of $150,000,000 principal amount of additional Notes pursuant to the terms of Section 2.05 of the Indenture, all of which shall be Series CIPS-BB Notes. The principal amount of the Series CIPS-BB Notes outstanding from time to time shall always be equal to the principal amount of the 2011 Notes which are outstanding from time to time under the CIPS Indenture and to the extent the CIPS Trustee holds Series CIPS-BB Notes in excess of such principal amount, such Series CIPS-BB Notes shall be deemed cancelled and retired and no longer outstanding under the Indenture.
 
Section 8.2 For purposes of Section 16.09 of the CIPS Indenture, the Series CIPS-BB Notes shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of IP Senior Notes" in respect of the 2011 Notes.

The Trustee may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the 2036 Notes, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing sentence unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the CIPS Trustee signed by one of its officers stating (i) the timely payment of principal, or premium, if any, or interest on, the 2036 Notes has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the CIPS Trustee pursuant to the CIPS Indenture, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.

Upon any payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, all or any portion of the Senior Notes, whether at maturity or prior to maturity by redemption or otherwise or upon provision for the payment thereof having been made in accordance with Section 5.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, a principal amount of this Mortgage Bond equal to the principal amount of such Senior Notes shall, to the extent of such payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, be deemed paid and the obligation of the Company thereunder to make such payment shall be discharged to such extent and, in the case of the payment of principal (and premium, if any), such Mortgage Bonds shall be surrendered to the Company for cancellation as provided in Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture. The Trustee (as hereinafter defined) may at any time and all times conclusively assume that the obligation of the Company to make payments with respect to the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Senior Notes, so far as such payments at the time have become due, has been fully satisfied and discharged pursuant to the foregoing sentence unless and until the Trustee shall have received a written notice from the Senior Note Trustee signed by one of its officers stating (i) that timely payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Senior Notes has not been made, (ii) that the Company is in arrears as to the payments required to be made by it to the Senior Note Trustee pursuant to the Senior Note Indenture, and (iii) the amount of the arrearage.
For purposes of Section 4.09 of the Senior Note Indenture, this Mortgage Bond shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of Senior Note Mortgage Bonds" in respect of the Senior Notes.
This Mortgage Bond shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, or become valid or obligatory for any purpose, until the form of certificate endorsed hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, the Trustee under the Indenture, or a successor trustee thereto under the Indenture (the "Trustee").
The provisions of this Mortgage Bond are continued on the reverse hereof and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Ameren Illinois Company has caused this Mortgage Bond to be signed (manually or by facsimile signature) in its name by an Authorized Executive Officer, as defined in the aforesaid Indenture, and attested (manually or by facsimile signature) by an Authorized Executive Officer, as defined in such Indenture on the date hereof.
 
 
This is one of the Mortgage Bonds of the series designated therein referred to in the within mentioned Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 2010.
 
This Mortgage Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Mortgage Bonds of the Company (the "Mortgage Bonds") in unlimited aggregate principal amount, of the series hereinafter specified, all issued and to be issued under and equally secured by the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust (the "Indenture"), dated as of November 1, 1992, executed by the Illinois Power Company (now the Company) to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank (the "Trustee") to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the properties mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security, the rights of registered owners of the Mortgage Bonds and of the Trustee in respect thereof, and the terms and conditions upon which the Mortgage Bonds are, and are to be, secured. The Mortgage Bonds may be issued in series, for various principal sums, may mature at different times, may bear interest at different rates and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture. This Mortgage Bond is one of a series designated as the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds of the Company, unlimited in aggregate principal amount, issued under and secured by the Indenture and described in the Supplemental Indenture dated as of October 1, 2010 (the "Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 2010" ), between the Company and the Trustee, supplemental to the Indenture.
This Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bond is subject to redemption in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Indenture of October 1, 2010.
This Mortgage Bond shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, except to the extent that the law of any other jurisdiction shall be mandatorily applicable.
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall occur, the principal of all Mortgage Bonds at any such time outstanding under the Indenture may be declared or may become due and payable, upon the conditions and in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture provides that such declaration may be rescinded under certain circumstances.
Section 1. The Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds are not redeemable except on the date, in the principal amount and for the redemption price that correspond to the redemption date for, the principal amount to be redeemed of, and the redemption price for, the Series CIPS-CC Notes, and except as set forth in Section 2 of this Article.
In the event that the Company redeems any Series CIPS-CC Notes prior to maturity in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Note Indenture, the Senior Note Trustee shall on the same date deliver to the Company the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds in principal amount corresponding to the Series CIPS-CC Notes so redeemed, as provided in Section 4.08 of the Senior Note Indenture. The Company agrees to give the Trustee notice of any such redemption of the Series CIPS-CC Notes on or before the date fixed for any such redemption.
 
Section 2. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Senior Note Indenture (as defined therein) and the acceleration of the Series CIPS-CC Notes, the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds shall be redeemable in whole upon receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of a written demand (hereinafter called a "Redemption Demand") from the Senior Note Trustee stating that there has occurred under the Senior Note Indenture both an Event of Default and a declaration of acceleration of payment of principal, accrued interest and premium, if any, on the Series CIPS-CC Notes specifying the last date to which interest on such Series CIPS-CC Notes has been paid (such date being hereinafter referred to as the "Initial Interest Accrual Date") and demanding redemption of the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds. The Company waives any right it may have to prior notice of such redemption under the Indenture. Upon surrender of the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds by the Senior Note Trustee to the Trustee, the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds shall be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon from the Initial Interest Accrual Date to the redemption date; provided, however, that in the event of a rescission or annulment of acceleration of the Series CIPS-CC Notes pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 8.01(a) of the Senior Note Indenture, then any Redemption Demand shall thereby be deemed to be rescinded by the Senior Note Trustee although no such rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 1. The Company hereby exercises the right to obtain the authentication of $61,500,000 principal amount of additional Bonds pursuant to the terms of Section 4.04 of the Indenture, all of which shall be Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds. The principal amount of the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds outstanding from time to time shall always be equal to the principal amount of the Series CIPS-CC Notes which are outstanding from time to time under the Senior Note Indenture and to the extent the Senior Note Trustee holds Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds in excess of such principal amount, such Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed cancelled and retired and no longer outstanding under the Indenture.
Section 2. Such Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds may be authenticated and delivered prior to the filing for recordation of this Supplemental Indenture.
Section 3. For purposes of Section 4.09 of the Senior Note Indenture, the Series CIPS-CC Mortgage Bonds shall be deemed to be the "Related Series of Senior Notes Mortgage Bonds" in respect of the Series CIPS-CC Notes.
The Trustee hereby accepts the trusts hereby declared and provided, and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions in the Indenture set forth and upon the following terms and conditions:
The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or the due execution hereof by the Company or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which recitals are made by the Company solely. In general, each and every term and condition contained in Article Eleven of the Indenture shall apply to this Supplemental Indenture with the same force and effect as if the same were herein set forth in full, with such omissions, variations and modifications thereof as may be appropriate to make the same conform to this Supplemental Indenture.
Except as otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms defined in the Indenture are used herein as therein defined. This Supplemental Indenture may be simultaneously executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

Exhibit 99.1
On October 1, 2010, Central Illinois Public Service Company ("CIPS"), Central Illinois Light Company ("CILCO") and Illinois Power Company ("IP") completed the previously announced merger whereby CILCO and IP merged with and into CIPS, with CIPS as the surviving entity (the "Merger"), pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of April 13, 2010, among CIPS, CILCO and IP. Upon consummation of the Merger, CIPS' name was changed to "Ameren Illinois Company" ("Ameren Illinois") and the separate legal existence of CILCO and IP terminated. Prior to the Merger, each of CIPS, CILCO and IP was a registrant subsidiary of Ameren Corporation ("Ameren"). Immediately following the Merger, Ameren Illinois distributed all of its shares of AmerenEnergy Resources Generating Company ("AERG") common stock to Ameren (sometimes referred to as the "AERG distribution") with the subsequent contribution by Ameren of AERG stock to Ameren Energy Resources Company.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of income presented below are based on the historical financial statements of CIPS, CILCO and IP after giving effect to the Merger of CILCO and IP with and into CIPS and the AERG distribution. The Merger and the AERG distribution represent transactions between entities under common control. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, assets and liabilities transferred between entities under common control are accounted for at the historical cost basis of the common parent. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2010, gives effect to the Merger and the AERG distribution as if these events had occurred on June 30, 2010. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, and for the interim periods for the six months ended June 30, 2010, and 2009, give effect to the Merger and the AERG distribution as if these events had occurred on January 1, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of income are for illustrative purposes only. They should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Merger and the AERG distribution actually been consummated on the dates indicated and do not purport to be indicative of results of operations as of any future date or for any future period.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of income reflect the following actions that occurred prior to the effective time of the Merger: (i) Ameren contributed to the capital of IP, without the payment of any consideration, all of the IP preferred stock owned by Ameren; (ii) CILCO redeemed all of its outstanding preferred stock; and (iii) CIPS redeemed all of its 7.61% first mortgage bonds. Each series of outstanding debt of CIPS, CILCO and IP, except as described above, remains outstanding and governed by the indenture under which it was originally issued, except that Ameren Illinois has been substituted as the obligor under the indebtedness of CILCO and IP.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of income have been derived from and should be read in conjunction with:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1Basis of Presentation
On October 1, 2010, CILCO and IP were merged with and into CIPS as part of a corporate reorganization of Ameren. Upon consummation of the Merger, CIPS' name was changed to Ameren Illinois. Immediately following the Merger, Ameren Illinois distributed all of its shares of AERG common stock to Ameren with the subsequent contribution by Ameren of AERG stock to Ameren Energy Resources Company.
CIPS, CILCO and IP, all wholly owned (as to common stock) subsidiaries of Ameren, were entities under common control. Authoritative accounting guidance requires that transactions between entities under common control be valued and recorded at the historical cost basis of the parent. Accordingly, the financial statements of the receiving entity, CIPS, will reflect the transferred assets and liabilities of CILCO and IP at the historical cost basis of the common parent, Ameren.
Ameren's historical cost basis in CILCO included purchase accounting-related adjustments in connection with Ameren's acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of CILCORP Inc. ("CILCORP") in 2003. Such purchase accounting-related adjustments were components of Ameren's basis in CILCO. As such, purchase accounting adjustments relating to CILCO's rate-regulated electric and gas transmission and distribution businesses, recorded at Ameren, were pushed down to the financial statements of Ameren Illinois.
The AERG distribution was accounted for as a spin-off. Ameren Illinois transferred AERG to Ameren by distributing shares of AERG common stock to Ameren based on AERG's carrying value. Subsequent to the AERG distribution, all AERG-related activity will be presented as discontinued operations in the Ameren Illinois financial statements.
