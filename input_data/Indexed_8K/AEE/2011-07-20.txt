Ameren Corporation and its registrant subsidiary Union Electric Company, doing business as Ameren Missouri, are each filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A to their Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 15, 2011 ("Form 8-K"). When the Form 8-K was filed in the EDGAR system, the EDGAR tag for Item 8.01 was included but the EDGAR tag for Item 2.06 was inadvertently omitted. This Form 8-K/A amends the Form 8-K to include, for purposes of filing in the EDGAR system, the EDGAR tag for Item 2.06. All other information in the Form 8-K remains unchanged.
ITEM 2.06 Material Impairments.
The disclosure provided under Item 2.06 in the Form 8-K remains unchanged.
ITEM 8.01 Other Events.
The disclosure provided under Item 8.01 in the Form 8-K remains unchanged.
 
 
This combined Form 8-K/A is being filed separately by Ameren Corporation and Union Electric Company (each a "registrant"). Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf. No registrant makes any representation as to information relating to any other registrant.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized. The signature for each undersigned company shall be deemed to relate only to matters having reference to such company or its subsidiaries.
