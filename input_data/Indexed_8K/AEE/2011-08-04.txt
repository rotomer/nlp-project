For Immediate Release
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, MO., Aug. 4, 2011  Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second quarter 2011 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $138 million, or 57 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2010 GAAP net income of $152 million, or 64 cents per share. Excluding certain items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded second quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) net income of $143 million, or 59 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) net income of $173 million, or 73 cents per share.
The decline in second quarter 2011 earnings, compared to second quarter 2010 earnings, reflected a 4% decrease in kilowatthour sales to regulated utility native load customers, partly due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the higher temperatures experienced in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 earnings also included a charge to earnings resulting from an April 2011 Missouri Public Service Commission requirement that certain revenues be flowed through the fuel adjustment clause. Other factors that reduced second quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings included increased storm-related expenses, higher tax rates and lower capitalized financing costs.
Factors that favorably contributed to second quarter 2011 earnings, compared to second quarter 2010 earnings, included electric rate increases in Illinois and in Missouri, effective in 2010; a gas delivery rate increase in Missouri, effective in early 2011; the absence of a Callaway energy center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage; and
 
 
lower interest expense. Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outages typically occur every 18 months, and the 2011 outage is scheduled for this fall.
"Our second quarter 2011 core earnings results were on track with our expectations," said Thomas R. Voss, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ameren Corporation. "We were challenged by an unusually large number of storms in the first half of this year, but our employees responded aggressively and effectively to restore service and meet our customers' expectations. Our management team also took action during the quarter to align spending with business conditions. As a result, today we are narrowing our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.30 to $2.55 per share. We also remain on track to generate positive free cash flow this year. This guidance incorporates second quarter results, the recent Missouri electric rate case decision and our continued commitment to aligning overall spending with regulatory outcomes and market and economic conditions."
Ameren calculates free cash flow by subtracting its cash flows from investing activities (which include capital expenditures), dividends and net advances for construction from its cash flows from operating activities.
For the six months ended June 30, 2011, Ameren recorded GAAP net income of $209 million, or 87 cents per share, compared to $254 million, or $1.07 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2010. Excluding certain items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded core (non-GAAP) net income of $203 million, or 84 cents per share, for the first six months of 2011, compared to core (non-GAAP) net income of $268 million, or $1.13 per share, for the first six months of 2010.
The decline in earnings for the first six months of 2011, compared to earnings for the first six months of 2010, reflected a 2% decrease in kilowatthour sales to regulated utility native load customers, partly due to milder temperatures in the first six months of 2011, compared to more extreme temperatures in the first six months of 2010. Earnings for the first six months of 2011 also included the previously mentioned charge for a Missouri Public Service Commission requirement that certain revenues be flowed through the fuel adjustment clause. In addition, merchant generation margins declined due to higher fuel and transportation-related costs, lower generation levels and lower realized power prices. Other factors that reduced earnings for the first six months of 2011, compared to the first six months of 2010, included increased storm-related expenses and lower capitalized financing costs.
 
 
Factors that favorably contributed to earnings for the first six months of 2011, compared to earnings for the first six months of 2010, included the previously mentioned rate increases, the absence of a Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage and lower interest expense.
The following items were excluded from second quarter and six month 2011 and 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings, as applicable:
 
 
A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
2011 Earnings Guidance
Ameren also announced today updated expectations for full-year 2011 earnings. Core (non-GAAP) 2011 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.20 to $2.60 per share. GAAP 2011 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $2.07 to $2.32 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.20 to $2.60 per share. The narrowing of core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance reflected second quarter 2011 earnings results and the July 2011 Missouri electric rate case decision. The difference between GAAP and core (non-GAAP) guidance is due to a planned third quarter 2011 charge, estimated at $0.23 per share, for the Missouri Public Service Commission's disallowance of recovery of certain
 
 
investments at the Taum Sauk energy center. Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings but are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses for the full year. Core (non-GAAP) earnings and guidance exclude any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses.
Ameren expects its business segments to provide the following contributions to 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share:
 
Ameren's earnings guidance for 2011 assumes normal weather for the second half of the year. In addition, Ameren's future results are subject to the effects of, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center operations; energy, economic, and capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
Ameren Missouri Segment Results
Ameren Missouri segment second quarter 2011 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings were $90 million, compared to second quarter 2010 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings of $113 million and $114 million, respectively. The decline in earnings reflected lower electricity sales to native load customers partly due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the higher temperatures experienced in the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter 2011 earnings also included the previously mentioned charge for a Missouri Public Service Commission requirement that certain revenues be flowed through the fuel adjustment clause. Other factors that reduced second quarter 2011 earnings included increased storm-related expenses, higher property taxes, a higher effective income tax rate and lower capitalized financing costs. Factors that favorably impacted second quarter 2011 earnings included increased electric rates, effective in June 2010; increased gas delivery rates, effective in February 2011; and the previously discussed absence of a Callaway nuclear refueling and maintenance outage. The difference between second quarter 2010 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings resulted from a net unrealized mark-to-market loss.
 
 
Ameren Illinois Segment Results
Ameren Illinois segment second quarter 2011 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings were $37 million, compared to second quarter 2010 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings of $46 million. The decline in earnings reflected lower electricity sales partly due to milder temperatures in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the higher temperatures experienced in the second quarter of 2010; increased storm-related expenses; and higher benefits costs. Factors that favorably impacted earnings included increased electric delivery rates, effective in 2010.
Merchant Generation Segment Results
Merchant generation segment second quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $20 million, compared to second quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $17 million. The increase in earnings was primarily due to reduced financing costs. Factors that negatively impacted second quarter 2011 earnings included lower margins reflecting lower generation levels and higher transportation-related costs. Second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were $15 million, compared to a second quarter 2010 GAAP loss of $2 million. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above and by a reduced loss from net unrealized mark-to-market activity in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the second quarter of 2010.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Ameren's total earnings per share.
 
 
The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance exclude one or more of the following: net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses, a charge for the deferred tax impact of changes in federal healthcare laws and a planned charge for the Missouri Public Service Commission's disallowance of certain investments at the Taum Sauk energy center. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core (non-GAAP) earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those listed above. Other than the planned charge relating to the Missouri Public Service Commission's disallowance of certain investments at the Taum Sauk energy center. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
In this release, Ameren has also discussed free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure. Ameren calculates free cash flow by subtracting its cash flows from investing activities (which include capital expenditures), dividends on common stock, dividends paid to noncontrolling interest holders and net generator advances for construction from its cash flows from operating activities. Ameren uses free cash flow internally and when communicating with analysts and investors to measure its ability to generate cash.
