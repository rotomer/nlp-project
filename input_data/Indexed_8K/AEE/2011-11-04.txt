For Immediate Release
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 4, 2011  Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced third quarter 2011 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $285 million, or $1.18 per share, compared to a third quarter 2010 GAAP net loss of $167 million, or 70 cents per share. Third quarter 2011 GAAP net income included $76 million and the third quarter 2010 GAAP net loss included $522 million of goodwill, impairment and other charges. Excluding these charges and certain other items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) net income of $381 million, or $1.57 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) net income of $333 million, or $1.40 per share.
The increase in third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, compared to third quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings, reflected Illinois and Missouri electric rate increases, lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, warmer weather and lower interest expense. These positive factors were partially offset by reduced margins in the merchant generation segment due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation-related expenses.
"Third quarter core earnings were strong, driven by warmer-than-normal weather and continued disciplined cost management," said Thomas R. Voss, chairman, president and CEO of Ameren Corporation. "As a result, today we are raising our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up from our prior guidance range of

$2.30 to $2.55 per share. In addition, we continue to improve our 2011 positive free cash outlook."
Ameren calculates free cash flow by subtracting its cash flows from investing activities (which include capital expenditures), dividends and net advances for construction from its cash flows from operating activities.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2011, Ameren recorded GAAP net income of $494 million, or $2.05 per share, compared to $87 million, or 37 cents per share, for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2010. Excluding certain items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded core (non-GAAP) net income of $585 million, or $2.42 per share, for the first nine months of 2011, compared to core (non-GAAP) net income of $601 million, or $2.53 per share, for the first nine months of 2010.
The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first nine months of 2011, compared to core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first nine months of 2010, reflected reduced margins in the merchant generation segment due primarily to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation-related expenses. Other factors that reduced core (non-GAAP) earnings included a decrease in kilowatthour sales to regulated utility native load customers, increased storm-related expenses and lower capitalized financing expenses. The effects of the above factors were partially offset by Illinois and Missouri electric rate increases and lower interest expense. Core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first nine months of 2011 also reflected the absence of a Callaway Energy Center nuclear refueling and maintenance outage, compared to the first nine months of 2010.
The following items were excluded from third quarter and first nine months of 2011 and 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings, as applicable:

new environmental rules, the primary impact of which was the decision to cease operations at the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers by the end of 2011. The 2010 charges were for goodwill and other impairments;
 
 
A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
2011 Earnings Guidance
Ameren today also announced increased expectations for full-year 2011 earnings. Core (non-GAAP) 2011 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up from the prior range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share. GAAP 2011 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.28 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.07 to $2.32 per share. The increased core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance reflects strong third quarter core earnings coupled with continued disciplined cost management. The difference between GAAP and core (non-GAAP) guidance is due to the third quarter 2011 charge of 23 cents per share related to the Taum Sauk Energy Center and the 9 cents per share charge primarily related to the planned closure of the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers. Any charge that may result from the recently

announced voluntary retirement offer to certain employees as well as any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings but are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses for the full year. Core (non-GAAP) earnings and guidance also exclude any charge resulting from the voluntary retirement offer and any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses.
Ameren expects its business segments to provide the following contributions to 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share:
 
Ameren's earnings guidance for 2011 assumes normal weather for the fourth quarter of the year. In addition, Ameren's future results are subject to the effects of, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center operations; energy, economic, and capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
Ameren Missouri Segment Results
Ameren Missouri segment third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were $190 million, compared to third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $223 million. Third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $248 million, compared to third quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $221 million. The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected the Missouri electric rate increase effective in late July 2011, lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses and warmer weather. The effects of these positive factors were partially offset by a decrease in kilowatthour sales to native load customers and lower capitalized financing expenses. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above and by the third quarter 2011 charge related to the Taum Sauk Energy Center. In addition, net unrealized mark-to-market activity resulted in a third quarter 2011 loss, compared to a third quarter 2010 gain.

Ameren Illinois Segment Results
Ameren Illinois segment third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings were $98 million, compared to third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $90 million. Third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $99 million, compared to third quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $90 million. The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected Illinois electric rate increases effective in 2010, an increase in kilowatthour sales to native load customers and lower financing expenses. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above and by a third quarter 2011 loss from net unrealized mark-to-market activity.
Merchant Generation Segment Results
The merchant generation segment third quarter 2011 GAAP loss was $9 million, compared to the third quarter 2010 GAAP loss of $470 million. Third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $24 million, compared to third quarter 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $34 million. The decline in core (non-GAAP) earnings was due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation-related expenses. The effects of these negative factors were partially offset by lower interest expense. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above, the third quarter 2011 charge related to the planned closure of the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers and the third quarter 2010 charge for goodwill and other impairment charges. In addition, net unrealized mark-to-market activity resulted in a third quarter 2011 loss, compared to a third quarter 2010 gain.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Ameren's total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance exclude one or more of the following: a charge for the Missouri Public Service Commission's disallowance of certain investments at the Taum Sauk Energy Center, goodwill, impairment and other charges, any charge that may result from the recently announced voluntary retirement offer to certain employees, net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses and a charge for the deferred tax impact of changes in federal health care laws. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core (non-GAAP) earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
In this release, Ameren has also discussed free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure. Ameren calculates free cash flow by subtracting its cash flows from investing activities (which include capital expenditures), dividends on common stock, dividends paid to noncontrolling interest holders and net generator advances for construction from its cash flows from operating activities. Ameren uses free cash flow internally and when communicating with analysts and investors to measure its ability to generate cash.
