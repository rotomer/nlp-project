Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 23, 2012  Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced 2011 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $519 million, or $2.15 per share, compared to 2010 GAAP net income of $139 million, or 58 cents per share. 2011 GAAP net income included $77 million and 2010 GAAP net income included $522 million of goodwill, impairment and other charges, after taxes. Excluding these charges and certain other items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded 2011 core (non-GAAP) net income of $619 million, or $2.56 per share, compared to 2010 core (non-GAAP) net income of $657 million, or $2.75 per share.
The decrease in 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, compared to 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings, primarily reflected lower electric sales to native load utility customers due, in part, to summer temperatures that, while warmer than normal, were below those of a very hot 2010, as well as reduced margins in the merchant generation segment due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation-related expenses. The earnings comparison was also impacted by higher storm-related expenses and lower capitalized financing costs, as well as a 2011 charge to earnings resulting from a Missouri Public Service Commission requirement that certain revenues be flowed through the fuel adjustment clause. The effects of these factors were partially offset by increased electric utility rates in Missouri and Illinois, lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses and reduced interest costs.
 
 
 
"I am pleased to report that 2011 core earnings were in line with the increased guidance range we provided in early November. Continued disciplined cost management allowed us to offset the negative impact on sales of much warmer-than-normal fourth-quarter winter temperatures," said Thomas R. Voss, chairman, president and CEO of Ameren Corporation. "I am proud of our many accomplishments in 2011. These included investing more than $1 billion primarily in new regulated utility infrastructure; generating enough cash from operations to fund these investments and an increased common dividend while also reducing outstanding borrowings; and posting strong energy center and storm restoration performance.
"In addition, during 2011, Illinois enacted legislation that enables us to invest in the state to improve infrastructure and create jobs," Voss added. "Further, important steps were taken by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator allowing us to begin improving the region's transmission system."
For the fourth quarter of 2011, Ameren recorded GAAP net income of $25 million, or 10 cents per share, compared to $52 million, or 21 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding certain items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded core (non-GAAP) net income of $34 million, or 14 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to core (non-GAAP) net income of $56 million, or 22 cents per share, for the fourth quarter of 2010.
The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to core (non-GAAP) earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily reflected lower electric and natural gas sales to native load utility customers due, in part, to warmer winter temperatures, as well as a scheduled nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at the Callaway Energy Center. In 2010, a Callaway refueling outage occurred in the spring. In addition, margins in the merchant generation segment declined due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation-related expenses. The effects of these factors were partially offset by lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses and increased electric rates in Missouri and Illinois.
The following items were excluded from fourth quarter and full year 2011 and 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings, as applicable:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
2012 Earnings Guidance
"In 2012, we are taking actions to accelerate infrastructure investment and create jobs in our Illinois electric delivery and our transmission businesses. These investments will benefit customers by improving reliability and providing savings through greater
 
 
 
efficiencies, and we expect these investments to earn fair returns for our investors," said Mr. Voss.
Ameren expects 2012 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings but are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses. Core (non-GAAP) earnings and guidance also exclude any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses.
The projected decline in 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share, compared to 2011, is primarily due to expected lower margins at Ameren's merchant generation business segment and the impact of an assumed return to normal temperatures. The expected merchant generation margin decline in 2012, compared to 2011, reflects expected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation-related costs. A return to normal temperatures will reduce 2012 margins at the regulated utility business segments primarily because 2011 summer temperatures, while below those of a very hot 2010, were still much warmer than normal. The earnings impact of the above factors is expected to be mitigated by increased Missouri electric and Illinois gas rates and reduced non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses in Missouri.
Ameren expects its business segments to provide the following contributions to 2012 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share:
 
Ameren's earnings guidance for 2012 assumes normal temperatures for the full year. In addition, Ameren's future results are subject to the effects of, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center operations; energy, economic, and capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
Ameren Missouri Segment Results
Ameren Missouri segment 2011 GAAP earnings were $287 million, compared to 2010 GAAP earnings of $364 million. Core (non-GAAP) earnings for 2011 were $359
 
 
million, compared to 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $367 million. The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected a 2.6 percent decrease in electric sales to native load customers due, in part, to cooler summer and warmer winter temperatures. In addition, capitalized financing expenses were lower and depreciation expense was higher primarily due to the completion of scrubbers at the Sioux Energy Center in late 2010. Further, storm-related expenses were higher in 2011 than in 2010 and 2011 earnings included a charge resulting from a Missouri Public Service Commission requirement that certain revenues be flowed through the fuel adjustment clause. The effects of these factors were partially offset by increased electric rates and lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above, the 2011 charge related to the Taum Sauk Energy Center and 2011 employee separation charges. In addition, a charge for the impact on deferred taxes of changes in federal healthcare laws reduced 2010 earnings and net unrealized mark-to-market activity resulted in a 2010 gain.
Ameren Illinois Segment Results
Ameren Illinois segment 2011 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings were $193 million, compared to 2010 GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings of $208 million. The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected a 1.1 percent decrease in electric sales to native load customers due primarily to cooler summer and warmer winter temperatures. In addition, storm-related and depreciation expenses were higher in 2011 than in 2010. The effects of these factors were partially offset by increased electric rates and reduced interest expense. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above, a 2010 charge for the impact on deferred taxes of changes in federal healthcare laws and a 2010 gain from net unrealized mark-to-market activity.
Merchant Generation Segment Results
Merchant generation segment 2011 GAAP earnings were $45 million, compared to a 2010 GAAP loss of $409 million. Core (non-GAAP) earnings for 2011 were $72 million, compared to 2010 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $108 million. The decline in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected lower margins due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation-related expenses. This margin decline was partially offset by reduced interest expense. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above, the 2011 charge related to the closure of the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers and the 2010 charges for goodwill and other impairments. In
 
 
addition, a charge for the impact on deferred taxes of changes in federal healthcare laws reduced 2010 earnings and net unrealized mark-to-market activity resulted in a 2011 loss, compared to a 2010 gain.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Ameren's total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance exclude one or more of the following: employee separation charges, goodwill, impairment and other charges, net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses and a charge for the deferred tax impact of changes in federal health care laws. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core (non-GAAP) earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
