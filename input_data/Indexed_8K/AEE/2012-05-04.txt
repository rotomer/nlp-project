For Immediate Release
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, May 4, 2012  Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced a first quarter 2012 net loss in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $403 million, or $1.66 per share, compared to first quarter 2011 GAAP net income of $71 million, or 29 cents per share. The first quarter 2012 GAAP net loss included a noncash pretax asset impairment charge of $628 million. Excluding this charge and certain other items, Ameren recorded first quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) net income of $53 million, or 22 cents per share, compared to first quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) net income of $60 million, or 25 cents per share.
The decrease in first quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings, compared to first quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, primarily reflected lower regulated utility electric and natural gas sales and decreased margins at the merchant generation segment. The decline in utility sales was due to first quarter winter temperatures that were among the warmest on record, compared to somewhat colder than normal temperatures in the first quarter of 2011. The decreased merchant generation margins reflected reduced generation due to lower market prices for electricity. The effects of the above factors were partially offset by increased electric utility rates in Missouri, increased natural gas delivery rates in Illinois and lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, including reduced storm-related costs.
 
 
 
"While first quarter results were negatively affected by unusually warm winter weather, we continue to expect that core earnings will be in the range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share for the year," said Thomas R. Voss, chairman, president and CEO of Ameren Corporation.
"Our first quarter 2012 GAAP results included a noncash write down of our Duck Creek merchant generating energy center as a result of the sharp first quarter 2012 decline in market prices for electricity," added Voss.
The following items were excluded from first quarter 2012 and 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, as applicable:
 
 
 
A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
 
 
2012 Earnings Guidance
Ameren continues to expect 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. GAAP 2012 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.95 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share, as a result of the previously discussed first quarter 2012 asset impairment charge. Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings but are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses. Core (non-GAAP) earnings and guidance also exclude any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses.
Ameren expects its businesses to provide the following contributions to 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share:
 
Ameren's earnings guidance for 2012 assumes normal temperatures for the remaining three quarters of the year. In addition, Ameren's future results are subject to the effects of, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center operations; energy, economic, and capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
Ameren Missouri Segment Results
Ameren Missouri segment first quarter 2012 GAAP earnings were $21 million, unchanged from first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings. First quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $20 million, compared to first quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $21 million. The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected an 8 percent decline in electric sales to native load customers. These lower sales were due to near record warm winter temperatures, compared to somewhat colder than normal temperatures in the first quarter of 2011. The negative effect of warmer temperatures in the first quarter of 2012 was partially offset by increased electric rates, effective in late July 2011, and lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, including reduced storm-related costs. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by the factors mentioned above and a gain from net unrealized mark-to-market activity in the first quarter of 2012.
 
 
Ameren Illinois Segment Results
Ameren Illinois segment first quarter 2012 GAAP earnings were $27 million, compared to first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $33 million. First quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $26 million, compared to first quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $33 million. The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected a 2 percent decrease in electric sales and a 20 percent decrease in natural gas sales due to near record warm winter temperatures, compared to somewhat colder than normal temperatures in the first quarter of 2011. The earnings decrease also reflected a one-time pretax $7.5 million contribution to the Illinois Science & Energy Innovation Trust related to participation in the state's electric delivery formula ratemaking framework. This contribution is not recoverable in rates. The negative effects of these factors were partially offset by the recognition of revenue related to Illinois electric delivery formula ratemaking as well as increased natural gas delivery rates, effective in January 2012. The GAAP earnings comparison was impacted by a gain from net unrealized mark-to-market activity in the first quarter of 2012.
Merchant Generation Segment Results
Merchant generation segment first quarter 2012 GAAP losses were $363 million, compared to first quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $20 million. Core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were $14 million, compared to first quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $11 million. The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected a lower effective core income tax rate as a result of lower projected full-year 2012 core earnings, compared to 2011 core earnings. The positive effect of this factor was partially offset by decreased merchant generation margins. These lower margins reflected reduced generation due to lower market prices for electricity. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above and the previously discussed first quarter 2012 asset impairment related to the Duck Creek Energy Center. In addition, net unrealized mark-to-market activity resulted in a lesser gain in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the first quarter of 2011.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Ameren's total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance exclude one or more of the following: asset impairment charges, reduction of income tax benefit and net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core (non-GAAP) earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
