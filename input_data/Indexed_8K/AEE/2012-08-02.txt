For Immediate Release
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 2, 2012  Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced second quarter 2012 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $211 million, or 87 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2011 GAAP net income of $138 million, or 57 cents per share. Excluding certain items discussed below, Ameren recorded second quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) net income of $177 million, or 73 cents per share, compared to second quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) net income of $143 million, or 59 cents per share.
The increase in second quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings, compared to second quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, reflected increased earnings from regulated utility operations partially offset by decreased earnings from merchant generation operations. Regulated utility earnings were positively impacted by a favorable Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order related to a disputed Ameren Missouri power purchase agreement that expired in 2009, the absence in 2012 of a 2011 Ameren Missouri charge to earnings related to the fuel adjustment clause, and 2011 Missouri electric and 2012 Illinois gas rate adjustments. Other factors having a favorable effect on the regulated utility earnings comparison included reduced storm-related costs and increased electric sales to native load customers resulting from warmer temperatures. Merchant generation earnings were negatively impacted by lower market prices for electricity.
 
 
 
"Second quarter earnings benefited from warmer-than-normal temperatures, a FERC order related to a disputed power purchase agreement, and continued disciplined management of our costs," said Thomas R. Voss, chairman, president and CEO of Ameren Corporation. "The positive earnings impact of warm second quarter weather partially offset the negative impact of mild first quarter weather. Given our second quarter results, we are raising our guidance for 2012 core earnings to a range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share from our prior range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share.
"During the current extended period of very warm weather, which began with record temperatures in May, our utility systems have performed well, demonstrating the value of the significant reliability investments we have made in recent years. I commend our employees for their determination, skill and focus on safety exhibited under difficult working conditions," Voss added.
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, Ameren recorded a GAAP net loss of $192 million, or 79 cents per share, compared to GAAP net income of $209 million, or 87 cents per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2011. Excluding certain items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded core (non-GAAP) net income of $230 million, or 95 cents per share, for the first six months of 2012, compared to core (non-GAAP) net income of $203 million, or 84 cents per share, for the first six months of 2011.
The increase in core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first six months of 2012, compared to core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first six months of 2011, reflected the factors noted above in the discussion of second quarter 2012 results. The comparison of first half 2012 earnings to first half 2011 earnings was also negatively impacted by reduced electric and gas sales as a result of milder first quarter 2012 temperatures.
The following items were excluded from second quarter and six month 2012 and 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, as applicable:
 
 
 
 
A reconciliation of GAAP to core (non-GAAP) earnings per share is as follows:
 
2012 Earnings Guidance
Ameren today also increased its guidance for full-year 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings to a range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.20 to $2.50 per share. Core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance excludes the asset impairment charge of $1.55 per share discussed above. GAAP 2012 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $1.00 per share, compared to the prior range of $0.65 to $0.95 per share. This increase in the 2012 earnings guidance range reflected warmer-than-normal second quarter temperatures and the favorable FERC order related to a disputed power purchase agreement. Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings but are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses. Core
 
 
(non-GAAP) earnings and guidance also exclude any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses.
Ameren expects its businesses to provide the following contributions to 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share:
 
Ameren's earnings guidance for 2012 assumes normal temperatures for the second half of the year. July 2012 temperatures were much warmer than normal. In addition, Ameren's future results are subject to the effects of, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center operations; energy, economic, and capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
Ameren Missouri Segment Results
Ameren Missouri segment GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings were $143 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $90 million for the second quarter of 2011. The increase in earnings reflected a favorable FERC order related to a disputed power purchase agreement that expired in 2009, the absence in 2012 of a 2011 charge to earnings related to the fuel adjustment clause, and new electric rates effective in late July 2011. Other factors having a favorable effect on second quarter 2012 earnings included an increase in kilowatthour sales to native load customers due to warmer temperatures, and reduced storm-related costs. The positive effects of the above factors were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense.
Ameren Illinois Segment Results
Ameren Illinois segment second quarter 2012 GAAP earnings were $32 million, compared to second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $37 million. Second quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $33 million, compared to second quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $37 million. The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings in the second quarter of 2012 reflected increased reliability spending, excluding storm-related costs, and higher other taxes. The negative effects of the above factors were partially offset by new natural gas delivery rates effective in January 2012, an increase in
 
 
kilowatthour sales due to warmer temperatures, and lower financing costs. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above and by a $1 million loss from net unrealized mark-to-market activity in the second quarter of 2012.
Merchant Generation Segment Results
Merchant generation segment second quarter 2012 GAAP losses were $5 million, compared to second quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $15 million. Core (non-GAAP) losses for the second quarter of 2012 were $2 million, compared to second quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $20 million. The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected lower market prices for electricity. This negative factor was partially offset by reduced plant maintenance costs and depreciation expenses. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above and by a second quarter 2012 noncash income tax benefit related to the first quarter 2012 Duck Creek Energy Center asset impairment charge. This income tax benefit increased second quarter 2012 GAAP earnings by $3 million and was the result of the requirement to recognize interim period income tax expense using the annual estimated effective rate. The item is expected to have no impact on full-year 2012 merchant generation segment earnings. The GAAP earnings also included losses of $6 million and $5 million in the second quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, from net unrealized mark-to-market activity.
Ameren Other
In addition to the factors noted in the above segment discussions, second quarter 2012 GAAP earnings for Ameren were increased by a second quarter 2012 noncash income tax benefit of $39 million related to the first quarter 2012 Duck Creek Energy Center asset impairment charge. This income tax benefit was the result of the requirement to recognize interim period income tax expense using the annual estimated effective rate. The first half 2012 $45 million decrease in income tax benefit related to this asset impairment charge is projected to fully reverse over the balance of this year.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Ameren's total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance exclude one or more of the following: asset impairment charges, change in income tax benefit and net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Ameren uses core (non-GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core (non-GAAP) earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
