On August 20, 2012, Ameren Illinois Company ("Ameren Illinois"), a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation, issued and sold $400,000,000 principal amount of its 2.70% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the "New Notes"), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-182258-01), which became effective on June 21, 2012, and a Prospectus Supplement dated August 13, 2012 to a Prospectus dated June 21, 2012. Ameren Illinois received net offering proceeds of approximately $397.3 million, before expenses, upon the closing of the transaction. Ameren Illinois intends to use the net offering proceeds, together with other available cash, to provide the total amount of funds required to complete its previously announced tender offer (the "Tender Offer") to repurchase for cash its outstanding 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the "9.75% Notes") and 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the "6.25% Notes," and together with the 9.75% Notes, the "Tender Offer Notes"), including the payment of interest on the Tender Offer Notes purchased thereunder and all related fees and expenses. The maximum aggregate purchase price (including principal and premium) for the Tender Offer Notes will be $450 million (the "Maximum Tender Amount"). Ameren Illinois also expects to use the net proceeds from the offering of the New Notes to redeem, at par value, all or a portion of $51.1 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% debt maturing in 2014.
As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 10, 2012 (the "Early Tender Date"), approximately $87 million in aggregate principal amount of the 9.75% Notes and approximately $193 million in aggregate principal amount of the 6.25% Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. As more fully described in the Offer to Purchase (defined below), because the 9.75% Notes have a higher acceptance priority level than the 6.25% Notes, all 9.75% Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offer will be accepted for purchase up to the Maximum Tender Amount before any validly tendered and not validly withdrawn 6.25% Notes are accepted for purchase, up to the Maximum Tender Amount for all the Tender Offer Notes in the aggregate.
Holders who validly tendered (and did not subsequently withdraw) their Tender Offer Notes prior to the Early Tender Date, and whose Tender Offer Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer, will receive total consideration equal to $1,384.06 per $1,000 principal amount of 9.75% Notes and $1,218.36 per $1,000 principal amount of 6.25% Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the relevant series of Tender Offer Notes up to, but not including, the settlement date for such Tender Offer Notes accepted for purchase. Holders of Tender Offer Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) will receive $1,354.06 per $1,000 principal amount of 9.75% Notes and $1,188.36 per $1,000 principal amount of 6.25% Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the relevant series of Tender Offer Notes up to, but not including, the settlement date for such Tender Offer Notes accepted for purchase.
The tender offer is being made upon and is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated July 30, 2012 (the "Offer to Purchase"), and the related Letter of Transmittal.
The tender offer will expire at midnight, New York City time, on Aug. 24, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated (the "Expiration Date").
Ameren Illinois is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to report as exhibits certain documents in connection with the offering of the New Notes.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
From time to time, Ameren Illinois Company, an Illinois corporation (the "Company"), proposes to enter into one or more Pricing Agreements (each, a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein, to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its senior secured debt securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities"). The Designated Securities will be secured by a series of the Company's First Mortgage Bonds, specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "First Mortgage Bonds"), in the same aggregate principal amount and having the same stated interest rate and maturity date as the Designated Securities to which they relate.
The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or pursuant to the Indenture dated as of June 1, 2006 (as it has been or as it may be supplemented or amended, including the terms of the Designated Securities to be set forth in an order of the Company thereunder, the "Indenture")
between the Company, as successor to Illinois Power Company ("IP"), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee"). The First Mortgage Bonds will be issued under and pursuant to the Company's General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992, executed by the Company, as successor to IP, to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly BNY Midwest Trust Company, as successor trustee to Harris Trust and Savings Bank) (the "Mortgage Trustee" and, together with the Trustee, the "Trustees"), as heretofore amended and supplemented by various supplemental indentures, and as to be further amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture relating to the particular series of First Mortgage Bonds specified in Schedule II to the applicable Pricing Agreement (with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Supplemental Indenture"). The term "Mortgage," as used herein, shall be deemed to refer to such General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust as so amended and supplemented.
1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in this Underwriting Agreement or the Pricing Agreement relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters or to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each Pricing Agreement shall specify the title and aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities, the price to the public of such Designated Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the title and aggregate principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds securing such Designated Securities, the Supplemental Indenture relating to such First Mortgage Bonds, the Time of Sale and the Time of Sale Information (each as defined herein) with respect to such Designated Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the names of the Representatives of such Underwriters, if any, and the principal amount of such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set forth the date, time and manner of delivery of such Designated Securities and payment therefor. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

disapproved by the Representatives; to promptly notify the Representatives of any notice given to the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act (a "Rating Agency") of any intended decrease in any rating of any securities of the Company or of any intended change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change of any such rating, in each case by any such Rating Agency; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Designated Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Securities, of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act, of the suspension of the qualification of such Designated Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or relating to the offering of the Designated Securities, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Designated Securities or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order.
(b) If required by Rule 430B(h) under the Act, to prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than may be required by Rule 424 under the Act; and to make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved by the Representatives promptly after reasonable notice thereof.
(c) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Designated Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Designated Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
(d) To promptly furnish the Underwriters with electronic copies of the Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prepared by the Company (to the extent not previously delivered), as amended or supplemented, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Designated Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue
 
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act), such Time of Sale Information or such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as then amended or supplemented is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, or, if at any time prior to the Time of Delivery (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Information as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Information to comply with law, the Company will immediately notify the Underwriters thereof and forthwith prepare and, subject to Section 5(a) above, file with the Commission (to the extent required) and furnish to the Underwriters and to such dealers as the Representatives may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Information as may be necessary so that the statements in the Time of Sale Information as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Information will comply with law; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any Designated Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon the Representatives' request, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as the Representatives may request of any amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act.
(e) In accordance with Rule 158 under the Act, to make generally available to its securityholders and to holders of any Designated Securities, as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earning statement of the Company (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Act).
(f) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for any Designated Securities and continuing to and including the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery and which are substantially similar to such Designated Securities, without the prior written consent of the Representatives.
(g) Upon request of any Underwriter, to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to such Underwriter an electronic version of the Company's trademarks, servicemarks and corporate logo for use on the website, if any, operated by such Underwriter for the purpose of facilitating the on-line offering of the Designated Securities (the "License"); provided, however, that the License shall be used solely for the purpose described above, is granted without any fee and may not be assigned or transferred.
 
(h) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of any Designated Securities for the purposes set forth in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
(i) The Company will, pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433 under the Act.
(j) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Designated Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Designated Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives. If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Designated Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Designated Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Designated Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
(k) If at any time when Designated Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters the Company receives from the Commission a notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Representatives, (ii) promptly file a new registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to the Designated Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement or post-effective amendment to be declared effective and (iv) promptly notify the Representatives of such effectiveness. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Designated Securities to continue as contemplated in the registration statement that was the subject of the Rule 401(g)(2) notice or for which the Company has otherwise become ineligible. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new registration statement or post-effective amendment, as the case may be.
6. Whether or not any sale of the Designated Securities is consummated, the Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto, and the
 
mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and any dealers; (ii) the applicable Commission filing fees relating to the Designated Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso thereof; (iii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Underwriting Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, the Indenture, the Mortgage, any blue sky surveys, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iv) all expenses (not to exceed $5,000) in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(c) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with any blue sky surveys; (v) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (vi) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vii) the cost of preparing certificates for the Securities and the First Mortgage Bonds; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Trustees and any agent of the Trustees and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustees in connection with the Indenture, the Securities, the Mortgage and the First Mortgage Bonds; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 6. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section 6, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, any advertising expenses in connection with any offers the Underwriters may make and transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them.
7. Each Underwriter hereby represents and agrees that, except for one or more term sheets containing the information set forth in Schedule III to the applicable Pricing Agreement, it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the use of, any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company) other than (i) one or more term sheets relating to the Designated Securities which are not Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses and which contain preliminary terms of the Designated Securities and related customary information not inconsistent with the final term sheet prepared and filed by the Company pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, (ii) a free writing prospectus that contains no "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Act) that was not included (including through incorporation by reference) in the Preliminary Prospectus or a previously filed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, (iii) any Bloomberg L.P. or other electronic communication regarding comparable bond prices, (iv) any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus listed on Annex III hereto or prepared pursuant to Section 2(u) or Section 5(a) hereof, or (v) any free writing prospectus prepared by such Underwriter and approved by the Company in advance in writing.
8. The obligations of the several Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company contained herein and in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of the Time of Sale and the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed at and as of the Time of Sale and the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, as they case may be, and the following additional conditions:
 
(a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) and Rule 430A, Rule 430B or Rule 430C under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been timely filed with the Commission under the Act to the extent required by Rule 433 under the Act; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to Section 8A of the Act against the Company or related to the offering of the Designated Securities shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction.
(b) Counsel for the Underwriters shall have furnished to the Underwriters such written opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to such matters as the Underwriters may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such documents and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters. In rendering such opinion, such counsel may (i) state that such opinion is limited to matters covered by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of New York and (ii) rely as to matters of fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.

(i) Gregory L. Nelson, Esq., Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (x) with such changes therein as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Underwriters with the approval of counsel for the Underwriters, and (y) if the Time of Sale Information shall be supplemented after being furnished to the Underwriters for use in offering the Designated Securities, with changes therein to reflect such supplementation;
(ii) Craig W. Stensland, Esq., an Associate General Counsel of Ameren Services Company, an affiliate which provides legal and other professional services to the Company, in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto (x) with such changes therein as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Underwriters with the approval of counsel for the Underwriters, and (y) if the Time of Sale Information shall be supplemented after being furnished to the Underwriters for use in offering the Designated Securities, with changes therein to reflect such supplementation; and
 
(iii) Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto (x) with such changes therein as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Underwriters with the approval of counsel for the Underwriters, and (y) if the Time of Sale Information shall be supplemented after being furnished to the Underwriters for use in offering the Designated Securities, with changes therein to reflect such supplementation.
(d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Underwriters a letter, dated the date of such Pricing Agreement, and a letter dated such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives.
(e) (i) The Company shall not have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have been any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information as amended or supplemented on or prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
(f) On or prior to the Time of Delivery, the Representatives shall have received satisfactory evidence that the Designated Securities are rated as set forth in the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus referred to on Part A of Annex III hereto by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and that such ratings are in effect at the Time of Delivery.
(g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any Rating Agency, and (ii) no such Rating Agency shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities, unless such surveillance or review has been publicly announced prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement.

(i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(j) The ICC Order shall be in full force and effect at the Time of Delivery.
If any of the events specified in Sections 8(e), 8(g) or 8(h) hereof shall have occurred or the representation in Section 2(t) is incorrect in any respect, the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities may be terminated by the Representatives on notice to the Company at any time on or prior to the Time of Delivery and upon such notice being given, the parties hereto and thereto shall be released and discharged from their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder (except for the liability of the Company pursuant to Sections 6 or 12 hereof and the obligations of the parties hereto and thereto pursuant to Section 9 hereof). Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed under Rule 433(d) of the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or any such amendment or supplement, which information is specified in Section 9(b) hereof.
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement of or to the foregoing in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information, the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement of or to the foregoing, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: (i) the third paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, concerning the terms of the offering by the Underwriters, (ii) the third and fourth sentences of the fourth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, concerning market-making by the Underwriters, and (iii) the fifth paragraph of text under the caption "Underwriting" in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, concerning overallotment, stabilization and short-positions; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the
 
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability except to the extent that it has been prejudiced by such failure or from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in any such action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of any such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters
 
of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company notifies
 
the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Underwriting Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Underwriting Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
 
12. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein or the Company does not comply with its other obligations as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary.
14. This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Underwriting Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
17. This Underwriting Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
18. The Company hereby acknowledges that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriters are advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof.

ANNEX II
Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
(i) They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB");
(ii) In their opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
(iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the PCAOB of the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter(s) ended [            ] incorporated by reference into the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus;
(iv) They have compared the ratios of earnings to fixed charges in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Item 503(d) of Regulation S-K;
(v) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inspection of the minute books of the Company since the date of the latest audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (i) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter(s) ended [     ] incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or (ii) the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter(s) ended [     ] incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations adopted by the Commission;
 
(vi) nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that (i) at [     ], there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable) or decrease in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the [     ] unaudited consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter(s) ended [     ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, or (ii) for the period from [     ] to [     ], there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or net income, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur and except such other decreases as may be specified in such letter;
(vii) officials of the Company have advised them that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to [     ] are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by them with respect to changes in financial statement items after [     ] have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in paragraph (v). They have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at [     ] there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable) or decrease in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the [     ] unaudited consolidated balance sheet included in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q for the quarter(s) ended [     ] incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus; or (b) for the period from [     ] to [     ], there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated operating revenues or net income. Those officials referred to above stated that they cannot comment on any decreases in net current assets (working capital) or in stockholders' equity at [     ] compared to [     ], or decreases as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year in consolidated operating revenues or net income for the period from [     ] to [            ]. On the basis of these inquiries and their reading of the minutes as described in paragraph (v), nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that there was any such change in capital stock or increase in long-term debt (including short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt and intercompany notes payable), except in all instances for changes or increases which the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur.
(viii) In addition to the examination referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraph (v) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company, which appear in
 
the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and have found them to be in agreement.
All references in this Annex II to the Preliminary Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to the Preliminary Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) included with the Time of Sale Information (including the documents incorporated by reference therein) as defined in the Underwriting Agreement as of the date of the letter delivered on the date of the Pricing Agreement for purposes of such letter.

Payment of the principal of and interest and premium on this Note shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.12(a) of the Indenture.

Under the Indenture, one or more series of notes may be issued and, as used herein, the term "Notes" refers to the Notes of this Series and any other outstanding series of Notes. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a more complete statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Noteholders and of the terms upon which the Notes are and are to be authenticated and delivered. This Note has been issued in respect of the series designated on the first page hereof, issued in the initial aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000.
The Notes will be secured by first mortgage bonds (the "SENIOR NOTE MORTGAGE BONDS") delivered by the Company to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, issued under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust, dated as of November 1, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "MORTGAGE TRUSTEE"), as supplemented and modified (collectively, the "MORTGAGE"). Reference is made to the Mortgage and the Indenture for a description of the rights of the Trustee as holder of the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds, the property mortgaged and pledged, the nature and extent of the security and the rights of the holders of first mortgage bonds under the Mortgage and the rights of the Company and of the Mortgage Trustee in respect thereof, the duties and immunities of the Mortgage Trustee and the terms and conditions upon which the Senior Note Mortgage Bonds are secured and the circumstances under which additional first mortgage bonds may be issued.
So long as any of the Notes of this Series are outstanding, the Company will not permit a Release Date to occur.
Each Note of this Series shall be dated and issued as of the date of its authentication by the Trustee and shall bear an Original Issue Date.

Interest on this Note will accrue from and including the Original Issue Date specified above to, but excluding, March 1, 2013, and thereafter, from and including each Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date or any redemption date, as the case may be.
All or a portion of the Notes of this Series may be redeemed at the option of the Company at any time or from time to time. The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date prior to June 1, 2022 (three months prior to the Maturity Date) will be equal to the greater of the following amounts: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date; or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes of this Series being redeemed on that redemption date (not including any portion of any payments of interest accrued to the redemption date) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the Adjusted Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 15 basis points, as determined by the Reference Treasury Dealer (as defined below), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. The redemption price for the Notes of this Series to be redeemed on any redemption date on or after June 1, 2022 will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes of this Series being redeemed on the redemption date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Notes of this Series that are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date to the Holder of this Note as of the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Date. The redemption price will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The Company shall mail notice of any redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption.
Any notice of redemption at the Company's option may state that such redemption will be conditional upon receipt by the Trustee, on or prior to the redemption date, of money sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes of this Series or portions thereof called for redemption, and that if such money has not been so received, such notice will be of no force and effect and the Company will not be required to redeem such Notes or portions thereof.
"ADJUSTED TREASURY RATE" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"COMPARABLE TREASURY ISSUE" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Reference Treasury Dealer as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes of this Series to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes of this Series.
"COMPARABLE TREASURY PRICE" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (C) if only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, such quotation.
