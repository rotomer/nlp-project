For Immediate Release
 
 
 
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 9, 2012  Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) today announced third quarter 2012 net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $374 million, or $1.54 per share, compared to third quarter 2011 GAAP net income of $285 million, or $1.18 per share. Excluding certain items discussed below, Ameren recorded third quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) net income of $323 million, or $1.33 per share, compared to third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) net income of $381 million, or $1.57 per share.
The decrease in third quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings, compared to third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, reflected a decline in earnings of each of Ameren's three business segments. Ameren Illinois' earnings were negatively impacted by its Sept. 2012 rate order for electric delivery service and a change in the quarterly distribution of revenues and earnings resulting from formula ratemaking. In addition, Ameren Missouri core (non-GAAP) earnings declined due to lower electric sales and a higher effective income tax rate partially offset by the benefit of a 2011 electric rate adjustment. Third quarter 2012 temperatures, while warmer-than-normal, were similar to those experienced in the third quarter of 2011. Merchant generation segment core (non-GAAP) earnings also declined, compared to the third quarter of 2011, reflecting lower power prices and higher fuel costs.
"The third quarter was solid from an operations perspective with our system and people performing very well under extended severe weather conditions. Overall, earnings were in line with our expectations despite a challenging Illinois electric delivery rate order," said Thomas R. Voss, chairman, president and
 
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
CEO of Ameren Corporation. "Today, we have narrowed our 2012 core earnings guidance range to $2.35 to $2.45 per share from our prior range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share."
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2012, Ameren recorded GAAP net income of $182 million, or 75 cents per share, compared to GAAP net income of $494 million, or $2.05 per share, for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2011. Excluding certain items that are discussed below, Ameren recorded core (non-GAAP) net income of $553 million, or $2.28 per share, for the first nine months of 2012, compared to core (non-GAAP) net income of $585 million, or $2.42 per share, for the first nine months of 2011.
The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first nine months of 2012, compared to core (non-GAAP) earnings for the first nine months of 2011, reflected declines in Ameren Illinois and merchant generation segment earnings offset by increased Ameren Missouri earnings. Ameren Illinois' earnings were negatively impacted by a lower allowed return on equity (ROE), driven by lower Treasury bond yields under formula ratemaking for 2012, and by the utility's Sept. 2012 rate order for electric delivery service. The impact of these negative factors on earnings was partially offset by a 2012 Illinois gas rate adjustment. Merchant generation segment core (non-GAAP) earnings declined reflecting lower power prices and higher fuel costs. The increase in Ameren Missouri earnings reflected a 2011 electric rate adjustment, a favorable Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order related to a disputed power purchase agreement that expired in 2009, the absence in 2012 of a 2011 charge to earnings related to the fuel adjustment clause, and lower operations and maintenance expenses reflecting disciplined cost management and reduced storm-related costs.
The following items were excluded from third quarter and nine-month 2012 and 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings, as applicable:

2012 Earnings Guidance
Ameren narrowed its guidance for 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings to a range of $2.35 to $2.45 per share, compared to the prior range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. Core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance excludes the Duck Creek asset impairment charge of $1.55 per share discussed above. GAAP 2012 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share, compared to the prior range of $0.70 to $1.00 per share. Any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP and core (non-GAAP) earnings but are excluded from earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses.
Ameren expects its businesses to provide the following contributions to 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings per share:
 
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
Ameren's earnings guidance for 2012 assumes normal temperatures for the fourth quarter of the year. In addition, Ameren's future results are subject to the effects of, among other things, regulatory decisions and legislative actions; energy center operations; energy, economic, and capital and credit market conditions; severe storms; unusual or otherwise unexpected gains or losses; and other risks and uncertainties outlined, or referred to, in the Forward-looking Statements section of this press release.
Ameren Missouri Segment Results
Ameren Missouri segment GAAP earnings were $236 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $190 million for the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $235 million, compared to third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $248 million. The decrease in core (non-GAAP) earnings reflected lower electric sales and a higher effective income tax rate partially offset by the benefits of a 2011 electric rate adjustment. Third quarter 2012 temperatures, while warmer-than-normal, were similar to those experienced in the third quarter of 2011. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above as well as a $55 million charge in the third quarter of 2011 related to the previously-mentioned Taum Sauk disallowance and a $1 million gain in the third quarter of 2012 as opposed to a $3 million loss in the third quarter of 2011 from net unrealized mark-to-market activity.
Ameren Illinois Segment Results
Ameren Illinois segment third quarter 2012 GAAP earnings were $71 million, compared to third quarter 2011 GAAP earnings of $98 million. Third quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $70 million, compared to third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $99 million. This decline in earnings reflected the utility's Sept. 2012 rate order for electric delivery service and a change in the quarterly distribution of revenues and earnings resulting from formula ratemaking. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by the factors mentioned above as well as a $1 million gain in the third quarter of 2012 as opposed to a $1 million loss in the third quarter of 2011 from net unrealized mark-to-market activity.
Merchant Generation Segment Results
Merchant generation segment third quarter 2012 GAAP earnings were $20 million, compared to a third quarter 2011 GAAP loss of $9 million. Third quarter 2012 core (non-GAAP) earnings were $22 million, compared to third quarter 2011 core (non-GAAP) earnings of $24 million. The decrease in core earnings reflected the impact on margins of lower power prices and higher fuel costs partially offset by lower depreciation and operations and maintenance expenses. The GAAP earnings comparison was affected by
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
the factors mentioned above as well as a third quarter 2012 noncash $4 million reduction in the income tax benefit related to the first quarter 2012 Duck Creek Energy Center asset impairment charge. This reduction in income tax benefit resulted from the requirement to recognize interim period income tax expense using the annual estimated effective rate. GAAP earnings also included asset impairment and other charges of $21 million in the third quarter of 2011 related to the decision to cease operations at the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers as well as a $2 million gain in the third quarter of 2012 as opposed to a $12 million loss in the third quarter of 2011 from net unrealized mark-to-market activity.
Ameren Other
In addition to the factors noted in the above segment discussions, third quarter 2012 GAAP earnings for Ameren were increased by a third quarter 2012 noncash income tax benefit of $47 million related to the first quarter 2012 Duck Creek Energy Center asset impairment charge. This income tax benefit resulted from the requirement to recognize interim period income tax expense using the annual estimated effective rate. This item is not expected to impact full-year 2012 earnings.

Regulation G Statement
Ameren has presented certain information in this release on a diluted cents per share basis. These diluted per share amounts reflect certain factors that directly impact Ameren's total earnings per share. The core (non-GAAP) earnings per share and core (non-GAAP) earnings per share guidance exclude one or more of the following: asset impairment and other charges including the Taum Sauk regulatory disallowance, changes in the income tax benefit recognized in conjunction with asset impairment and other charges and the annual estimated effective income tax rate, and net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Ameren uses core (non-
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
GAAP) earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core (non-GAAP) earnings as primary performance measurements when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the company believes that core (non-GAAP) earnings allow the company to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods.
In providing consolidated and segment core (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, there could be differences between core (non-GAAP) earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as those listed above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such items.
