Ameren Corporation ("Ameren") and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into definitive multi-year credit facility agreements with a large and diverse group of lenders, providing substantial liquidity. These facilities cumulatively provide $2.1 billion of credit through November 14, 2017, which maturity date may be extended with the agreement of the lenders, subject to the terms of such agreements, for two additional one-year periods. The facilities currently include 24 international, national, and regional lenders with no lender providing more than $124 million of credit in aggregate.
On November 14, 2012, Ameren, Union Electric Company, doing business as Ameren Missouri ("Ameren Missouri"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a $1 billion multi-year, senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "2012 Missouri Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement dated as of September 10, 2010 (the "2010 Missouri Credit Agreement"), under which Ameren and Ameren Missouri were borrowers, was terminated contemporaneously with the entrance into the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement.
Also on November 14, 2012, Ameren, Ameren Illinois Company, doing business as Ameren Illinois ("Ameren Illinois"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a $1.1 billion multi-year, senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "2012 Illinois Credit Agreement" and, together with the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement, the "2012 Credit Agreements"). The Credit Agreement dated as of September 10, 2010 (the "2010 Illinois Credit Agreement"), under which Ameren and Ameren Illinois were borrowers, was terminated contemporaneously with the entrance into the 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement.
Contemporaneously with the entrance into each of the 2012 Credit Agreements, the Credit Agreement dated as of September 10, 2010 (the "2010 Genco Credit Agreement"), under which Ameren and Ameren Energy Generating Company ("Genco") were borrowers, was also terminated.
The obligations of each borrower under the respective 2012 Credit Agreement to which it is a party will be several and not joint, and, except under limited circumstances relating to expenses and indemnities, the obligations of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois under the respective 2012 Credit Agreements are not guaranteed by Ameren or any other subsidiary of Ameren. The maximum aggregate amount available to each borrower under each facility is as follows (such amount being such borrower's "Borrowing Sublimit"): (x) under the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement: Ameren$500 million and Ameren Missouri$800 million; and (y) under the 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement: Ameren$300 million and Ameren Illinois$800 million.
Ameren has the option to seek additional commitments from existing or new lenders to increase the total facility size of the 2012 Credit Agreements up to the following maximum amounts: in the case of the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement  $1.2 billion and in the case of the 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement  $1.3 billion. Each of the 2012 Credit Agreements will mature and expire with respect to Ameren on November 14, 2017 (unless extended as described above, but in no event, later than November 14, 2019) (such maturity date as then in effect being, the "Final Maturity Date"). Borrowing Sublimits of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois under the applicable 2012 Credit Agreement will mature and expire on November 13, 2013, subject to extension by the such borrowers with federal regulatory approvals on a 364-day basis or, upon subsequent receipt of required federal or state regulatory approvals, such later dates as requested (or permitted under such approvals), but in no event later than the Final Maturity Date. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois intend to seek regulatory approval to extend the maturity dates of their respective Borrowing Sublimits under the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement and 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement to November 14, 2017. If and when such regulatory approvals are received, no lender approval will be required to effect any such extensions. The principal amount of each revolving loan owed by a borrower under any 2012 Credit Agreement to which it is a party will be due and payable no later than the Final Maturity Date relating to such borrower under such 2012 Credit Agreement.
The obligations of all borrowers under the 2012 Credit Agreements are unsecured; provided that upon any grant of a lien (other than certain otherwise expressly permitted liens) by Ameren or any of its subsidiaries in order to secure indebtedness of the Ameren Corporation parent company, the lenders under the 2012 Credit Agreements will be entitled to equal and ratable liens on such property so encumbered in order to secure the obligations of Ameren under the 2012 Credit Agreements.
Loans are available on a revolving basis under each of the 2012 Credit Agreements and may be repaid (without premium or penalty) and, subject to satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing (as set forth below), reborrowed from time to time. At the election of each borrower, the interest rates on such loans will be the alternate base rate ("ABR") plus the margin applicable to the particular borrower and/or the Eurodollar rate plus the margin applicable to the particular borrower. The applicable margins will be determined by reference to, in the case of any borrower, such borrower's long-term unsecured credit ratings or, if no such ratings are then in effect, such borrower's corporate/issuers ratings then in effect. ABR is a fluctuating interest rate equal to the highest of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum and the one-month Eurodollar rate plus 1.00% per annum. The Eurodollar interest rate is the applicable British Bankers' Association London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars. A competitive bid rate is also available under the 2012 Credit Agreements if requested by a borrower. Letters of credit in an aggregate undrawn face amount not to exceed 25% of the applicable aggregate commitment under the respective 2012 Credit Agreements are also available for issuance for the account of the borrowers thereunder (but subject to the applicable overall combined facility borrowing limitations and the applicable Borrower Sublimits of the 2012 Credit Agreements). The applicable margins shall range from 1.00% to 2.05%, in the case of Eurodollar borrowings, and from 0.00% to 1.05%, in the case of ABR borrowings. The applicable margins for Eurodollar borrowings on the closing date were 1.275% for Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri and 1.475% for Ameren. There were no borrowings at closing. In addition, a commitment fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.45% (based on identical ratings criteria) shall be payable quarterly on the aggregate commitments. The fee rates applicable to the borrowers at closing were 0.225% for each of Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri and 0.275% for Ameren.
The 2012 Credit Agreements contain conditions to borrowings and issuances of letters of credit similar to those contained in the 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement and the 2010 Illinois Credit Agreement, including the absence of default or unmatured default, material accuracy of representations and warranties (excluding any representation after the closing date as to the absence of material adverse change or material litigation, and the absence of any notice of any violation, liability or requirement under any environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect) and required regulatory authorizations. In addition, solely as it relates to borrowings by Ameren Illinois under the 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement, it is also a condition precedent to any such borrowing that, at the time of and after giving effect to such borrowing, Ameren Illinois will not be in violation of any limitation on its ability to incur unsecured indebtedness contained in its articles of incorporation.
The 2012 Credit Agreements contain non-financial covenants including, among others, restrictions on the ability to incur liens, to transact with affiliates, to dispose of assets, to make investments in or transfer assets to its affiliates, and to merge with other entities. The 2012 Credit Agreements also contain financial covenants including, among others, a requirement that each of Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois maintain consolidated indebtedness of not more than 65% of its respective consolidated total capitalization pursuant to a defined calculation set forth in the agreements. In addition, under the 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement and, by virtue of the cross-default provisions of the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement, the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement, Ameren is required to maintain a ratio of consolidated funds from operations plus interest expense to consolidated interest expense of 2.0 to 1, to be calculated quarterly as of the end of the most recent four fiscal quarters then ending in accordance with the 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement. Failure of a borrower to satisfy a financial covenant constitutes an immediate default under the applicable 2012 Credit Agreement.
The 2012 Credit Agreements contain additional default provisions including, among others, a borrower's failure in the performance of certain nonfinancial covenants thereunder; a borrower's failure to make required payments when due thereunder; certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; judgments against a borrower or its subsidiaries in excess of $50 million in the aggregate which are not paid, stayed or otherwise discharged within 45 days; ERISA events reasonably expected to result in monetary liability resulting in a material adverse effect on such borrower; and any other breach by a borrower of the terms or provisions thereunder which is not remedied within 30 days after notice or receipt of actual knowledge thereof. The default provisions in the 2012 Credit Agreements apply separately to each borrower; provided, however, that a default of Ameren Missouri or Ameren Illinois under the applicable 2012 Credit Agreement will also be deemed to constitute a default of Ameren under such agreement. Defaults include a cross-default to a default of such borrower under any other agreement covering outstanding indebtedness of such borrower and certain subsidiaries (other than project finance subsidiaries and non-material subsidiaries) in excess of $50 million in the aggregate (including under the other 2012 Credit Agreement). However, under the default provisions of the 2012 Credit Agreements, any default of Ameren under any such 2012
Credit Agreements that results solely from a default of Ameren Missouri or Ameren Illinois thereunder does not result in a cross-default of Ameren under the other 2012 Credit Agreement. Further, the 2012 Credit Agreement default provisions provide that an Ameren default under either of the 2012 Credit Agreements does not trigger a default by Ameren Missouri or Ameren Illinois. Finally, for the purpose of determining whether any event relating solely to Genco or its subsidiaries constitutes a default with respect to Ameren under either 2012 Credit Agreement, Ameren will have the option to exclude Genco and its subsidiaries as being subsidiaries of Ameren which are subject to such 2012 Credit Agreement, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions include (i) the reduction of Borrowing Sublimits of Ameren under the respective 2012 Credit Agreements by not less than $150 million each (as determined from the highest Borrower Sublimit of Ameren that has been in effect at any time under the respective 2012 Credit Agreement) and (ii) that such default would not have a material adverse effect on Ameren (as such term is defined in the 2012 Credit Agreements).
The borrowers are permitted to use the proceeds of any borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreements for general corporate purposes, including working capital, repayment or refinancing of indebtedness outstanding from time to time and other funding needs, to repay amounts owed under the 2010 Genco Credit Agreement, the 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement and the 2010 Illinois Credit Agreement, as applicable, to fund loans under the Ameren money pool arrangements or other short-term intercompany loan arrangements and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2012 Credit Agreements.
Copies of the 2012 Missouri Credit Agreement and the 2012 Illinois Credit Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
As a condition to the effectiveness of the 2012 Credit Agreements, effective November 14, 2012, the 2010 Missouri Credit Agreement, the 2010 Illinois Credit Agreement and the 2010 Genco Credit Agreement were terminated in respect of all parties, including Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Genco.
 
See Item 1.01 above for a description of the 2012 Credit Agreements.

In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, but subject to any non-waivable provisions of the laws and/or other rules to which a Letter of Credit is subject, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest

Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements under outstanding Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of future reimbursement obligations under Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of such Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations of such Borrower under this Agreement. If either Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of any event specified in clause (i) or (ii) above with respect to such Borrower, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days after all Defaults with respect to such Borrower have been cured or waived and, if Loans or other Obligations (other than any unasserted contingent indemnity claims) of such Borrower have been accelerated, all such Loans and other Obligations of such Borrower have been repaid (or such acceleration has been rescinded). If at any time the cash collateral of either Borrower shall exceed 101% of such portion of the LC Exposure as of such date attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, the Agent shall apply such excess funds to the payment of such Borrower's Obligations or (x) if no such Obligations are then due and owing and no Default with respect to such Borrower shall exist, shall release such excess funds to such Borrower or (y) if no such Obligations are outstanding (other than contingent Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit which are fully collateralized and unasserted contingent indemnification claims), such excess amount shall be released to such Borrower notwithstanding the existence of a Default in respect of such Borrower.

The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or such Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case of payment by a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers may not terminate the Commitment of an Affected Lender if, after giving effect to such termination, (x) the Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitment (as then in effect giving effect to any increases thereof effected in accordance with the terms hereof) or (y) the Borrower Credit Exposure of either Borrower would exceed the Borrower Sublimit of such Borrower.

If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Commitment Termination Date extension request, then the Commitment Termination Date shall, as to the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the first anniversary of the Existing Commitment Termination Date. The decision of any Lender to agree or withhold agreement to any extension request shall be at the sole discretion of such Lender.

Each Lender shall, by notice to such Borrowing Subsidiary, the Company and the Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Agent's receipt of such Maturity Date Extension Request, advise such Borrowing Subsidiary and the Company whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (and, except as set forth in the following proviso, any Lender that has not so advised such Borrowing Subsidiary, the Company and the Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension); , that notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) so long as the Borrowing Subsidiary shall have received FERC authorization for short-term financings for the period through the requested Maturity Date, then upon written notice thereof to the Agent (either concurrently with the delivery of the Maturity Date Extension Request or at anytime thereafter but prior to the then effective Maturity Date) and satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the following sentence, each Lender shall be obligated to consent (and shall be deemed to have consented) to such

If requested by the Borrowing Subsidiary, the effectiveness of any such extension shall be confirmed by the Agent in writing to the Borrowing Subsidiary. Unless otherwise consented to by the Required Lenders, no extension of such Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.24 shall become effective unless the Agent shall have received (1) copies of any approvals by FERC and/or the Missouri Public Service Commission, as applicable, required for such extension and (2) legal opinions (including from Borrowing Subsidiary's in-house counsel) in substantially the form of those delivered pursuant to Section 4.1.7 solely as to the fact that any and all FERC, Missouri Public Service Commission and/or other regulatory approvals, as applicable, required to permit borrowings by and Credit Extensions to the Borrowing Subsidiary in the amount of its Borrower Sublimit through the extended Maturity Date have been obtained (to be in form and substance (to the extent of the limited scope thereof set forth above) reasonably satisfactory to the Agent).

(b) If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to the parent company of any Lender shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank shall have a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the applicable Borrower or such Lender reasonably satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to mitigate the risk to it in respect of such Lender failing to satisfy its participating interest therein.
(c) In the event that the Agent, each Borrower, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans (other than Competitive Loans and Swingline Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.
(d) Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.25 in connection with the obligations of the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Banks, the obligation of each Lender, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender to fund the full amount of its Commitment and to make Loans, Advances and other extensions of credit hereunder shall not be released or diminished in any respect by any other Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender.
 
(e) None of the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.25 shall be deemed to effect, diminish or release any rights, claims or causes of action the Borrowers may have against any Lender that becomes a Defaulting Lender.
2.26. . (a) The Borrowers may from time to time (and more than one time), by written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), executed by the Borrowers and one or more financial institutions (any such financial institution referred to in this Section being called an ""), which may include any Lender, cause new Commitments to be extended by the Augmenting Lenders or cause the existing Commitments of the Augmenting Lenders to be increased, as the case may be (the aggregate amount of such increase for all Augmenting Lenders on any single occasion being referred to as a ""), in an amount for each Augmenting Lender set forth in such notice; that (i) the amount of each Commitment Increase shall be not less than $10,000,000, except to the extent necessary to utilize the remaining unused amount of increase permitted under this Section 2.26(a) and (ii) the Aggregate Commitment shall not exceed $1,200,000,000 after giving effect to the effectiveness of any Commitment Increase. The decision of any Lender to become an Augmenting Lender shall be at the sole discretion of such Lender. Each Augmenting Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall not be subject to the approval of any other Lenders, and the Company and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Commitment of such Augmenting Lender and/or its status as a Lender hereunder (such documentation in respect of any Commitment Increase together with the notice of such Commitment Increase being referred to collectively as the "" in respect of such Commitment Increase).

Commitment Increase Amendment
(b) Upon each Commitment Increase pursuant to this Section, (i) each Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each Augmenting Lender providing a portion of such Commitment Increase, and each such Augmenting Lender will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed, a portion of such Lender's participations hereunder in outstanding Letters of Credit such that, after giving effect to such Commitment Increase and each such deemed assignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding participations hereunder in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit held by each Lender (including each such Augmenting Lender) will (subject to Section 2.25) equal such Lender's Pro Rata Share and (ii) if, on the date of such Commitment Increase, there are any Revolving Loans outstanding, the parties hereto shall, at the request of the Agent, take actions agreed upon by the Agent and the Company that will result, within a period acceptable to the Agent and the Company, in the outstanding Revolving Loans being held by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their Commitments. In determining the actions to be taken (which may include the prepayment and reborrowing of all or a portion of such Revolving Loans and/or the making of Revolving Loans on a non-pro-rata basis by Augmenting Lenders for the balance of Interest Periods in progress and at rates reflecting the Eurodollar Base Rate at the time for loans of such duration), the Agent and the Lenders will endeavor to minimize breakage costs for which the Borrowers must
 
compensate the Lenders to the extent practicable without undue complexity or administrative burdens on the Agent or the Lenders. The Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

(b) the Agent shall have received notice from the Required Lenders that the interest rate for Eurodollar Advances determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively determined by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Eurodollar Advances during such Interest Period, then (x) any Eurodollar Advances requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Floating Rate Advances, (y) any Floating Rate
 
Advances that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Advances shall be continued as Floating Rate Advances and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Advances shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current Interest Period, to Floating Rate Advances. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Agent, no further Eurodollar Advances shall be made or continued as such, nor shall any Borrower have the right to convert Floating Rate Advances to Eurodollar Advances.

Such loss or cost to any Lender in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain any such Eurodollar Advance or Fixed Rate Loan shall be an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurodollar Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (but not including the Applicable Margin applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit at the commencement of such period for a comparable period with leading banks in the London interbank eurodollar market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Defaulting Lender required to assign its Loans pursuant to Section 2.22 shall not be entitled to compensation under this Section 3.4 in connection with any such assignment.

Taxes
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of each Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by each Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
 
made. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by either Borrower to a governmental authority pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such governmental authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.
(b) The Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for, Other Taxes.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to either Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 20 days after written demand therefor (in each case setting forth the basis therefor and the manner of determination thereof), for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.1(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender, as applicable, by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(e) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times set forth herein or as are reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation
 
(other than such documentation set forth in Sections 3.5(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

provided
 
(C) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to each Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter as set forth herein or upon the reasonable request of either Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers and the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to each Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by either Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by either Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.5 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 3.5(f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.5(f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 3.5(f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 3.5(f) shall not be
 
construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(g) Each party's obligations under this Section 3.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
(h) For purposes of this Section 3.5, (i) the term "Lender" includes any applicable Lending Installation and any Issuing Bank and (ii) the term "applicable law" includes FATCA.
3.6. . The Agent, each Lender or each Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall deliver a written statement to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) as to each amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth an explanation in reasonable detail of the manner in which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on such Borrower in the absence of manifest error, and upon the reasonable request of such Borrower, such Lender shall promptly provide supporting documentation describing and/or evidencing the applicable event giving rise to such amount to the extent not inconsistent with such Lender's policies or applicable law. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type, currency and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable within fifteen (15) days (or, in the case of Section 3.5, twenty (20) days) after receipt by the applicable Borrower of such written statement, unless subject to a good faith dispute by such Borrower, notice and details of which were provided to the affected Lender prior to such due date. The obligations of each Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Borrowers shall not be responsible for any reimbursement of any such amount under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5 which shall have accrued and of which the Agent or the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have become aware more than 180 days prior to its delivery to the Borrower of notice requesting reimbursement thereof and (b) none of the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank will make any claim (nor shall any Borrower have any liability) under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 unless the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall have determined that the making of such claim is consistent with its general practices under similar circumstances in respect of similarly situated borrowers under credit agreements entitling it to make such claims.
Statements as to Claims; Survival of Indemnity
3.7. . To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. A Lender's designation of an alternative Lending Installation shall not affect the Borrowers' rights under Section 2.22 to replace a Lender.
Alternative Lending Installation
 
3.8. . Each amount payable by "the Borrowers" under this Article shall be an obligation of, and shall be discharged by (a) to the extent arising out of acts, events and circumstances related to a particular Borrower, such Borrower and (b) otherwise, both Borrowers, with each Borrower being severally liable for such Borrower's Contribution Percentage of such amount, that the Company agrees that, if the Borrowing Subsidiary shall fail to pay any amount owed by it under clause (b) of this Section after a demand shall have been made by the Person to which such amount is owed, the Company shall promptly pay such amount (the Company hereby irrevocably waiving any defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor of the obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary under this Section).

Such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall (i) be the subject of any proceeding or investigation pertaining to the release by such Borrower (or, in the case of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries) or any other Person of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment, or (ii) violate any Environmental Law; which, in the case of an event described in clause (i) or clause (ii), has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect on such Borrower or in monetary liability (in excess of any amount covered by insurance) that has not within 45 days been bonded, vacated, stayed pending appeal or discharged and could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on such Borrower.
7.14. Any material provision of any Loan Document shall fail to remain in full force or effect with respect to such Borrower or any action shall be taken to discontinue or to assert the invalidity or unenforceability of any material provision of any Loan Document with respect to such Borrower.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VII, for purposes of determining whether any event constitutes a Default with respect to the Company (at the election of the Company), Genco and its subsidiaries will not be deemed to be "Subsidiaries" of the Company if and for so long as each of the conditions set forth in clauses (a) through (c) below shall be satisfied:
 
 
 
8.1. . If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs with respect to a Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit hereunder to such Borrower (and, if such Borrower is the Borrowing
Acceleration
 
Subsidiary, the Company) shall automatically terminate and the Obligations of such Borrower (and, if such Borrower is the Borrowing Subsidiary, the Company) shall immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender. If any other Default occurs with respect to a Borrower, the Required Lenders (or the Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit hereunder to such Borrower, or declare the Obligations of such Borrower (and, in the case of a Default with respect to a Borrowing Subsidiary, of the Company) to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations of such Borrower (and, in the case of a Default with respect to the Borrowing Subsidiary, of the Company) shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which such Borrower hereby expressly waives.
If, after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to such Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Agent shall, by notice to such Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.
8.2. . None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each Borrower, the Agent and the Required Lenders and, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Agent and the other party or parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; that (i) any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by each Borrower and the Agent to correct any administrative or other manifest error, omission, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, the Lenders shall have received at least seven Business Days' prior written notice thereof and the Agent shall not have received, within seven Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such amendment and (ii) no such agreement shall (A) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (B) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (C) except as expressly otherwise provided herein, postpone the scheduled maturity date of any Loan or LC Disbursement or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (D) change Section 11.2 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, (E) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify, extend or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of the Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the applicable Borrower, the Required Lenders and the Agent if, by the terms of such agreement, (i) the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) upon the effectiveness of such amendment, each Lender not consenting to such amendment shall receive payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Advance made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.
8.3. .

Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by, or by the Agent with the consent of, the requisite number of Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.

The failure of the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve the Agent, any other Lender or any Issuing Bank of any of its obligations hereunder.

Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Borrowers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; that such consent shall not be required in the event and continuation of a Default), shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders or consented to by the Borrowers within thirty days after the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent.

If the Agent has resigned and, at such time, holds cash collateral under this Agreement, the Agent shall continue to hold such cash collateral for the benefit of the Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank until a successor Agent has been appointed.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Company, any such successor Agent shall be a Lender or, if no Lender will accept such appointment, a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $1,000,000,000 (or such lower amount as shall be acceptable to the Company). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

Pending Electric Rate Case
In February 2012, Union Electric Company ("") filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission ("") to increase its annual revenue for electric service. The currently pending request, as amended in October 2012, seeks an annual revenue increase of $323 million based on a 10.5% return on equity. The annual increase request includes $73 million related to an anticipated increase in normalized net fuel costs above the net fuel costs included in base rates previously authorized by the MoPSC in its 2011 electric rate order. The annual increase request also includes $80 million for recovery of the costs associated with energy efficiency programs under the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (""), which are discussed below. In this rate case, Ameren Missouri requested that the MoPSC approve the implementation of a storm cost tracking mechanism, as well as plant-in-service accounting treatment. The plant-in-service accounting proposal is designed to reduce the impact of regulatory lag on earnings and future cash flows related to assets placed in service between rate cases by both accruing a return on the assets and deferring depreciation expense from their in-service dates until those capitalized costs are included in rates.
Ameren Missouri
MoPSC
MEEIA
The MoPSC staff is currently recommending an increase to Ameren Missouri's annual revenues of $210 million based on a return on equity of 9%. The MoPSC staff opposed Ameren Missouri's request to implement a storm cost tracking mechanism and Ameren Missouri's plant-in-service accounting proposal. The MoPSC staff also recommended that all transmission costs currently recovered through the FAC (as defined below) be recovered through base rates. Other parties also made recommendations through testimony filed in this case.
Ameren Missouri has agreed to settlements of various issues, some of which have been approved by the MoPSC and some of which are still subject to approval by the MoPSC. One of the approved settlements will allow Ameren Missouri to retain the refund received in June 2012 from Entergy Arkansas, Inc. ("") related to a power purchase agreement that existed prior to the implementation of the FAC, which did not impact Ameren Missouri's pending request.
Entergy
The MoPSC has several important issues to consider in this case. Those issues include determining the appropriate return on equity, Ameren Missouri's request for the implementation of a storm cost tracking mechanism and plant-in-service accounting treatment, Ameren Missouri's request for recovery of its 2011 severance costs, and whether Ameren Missouri should be able to continue to employ its existing FAC, including all of the transmission costs currently included within the FAC, at the current 95% sharing level.
A decision by the MoPSC in this proceeding is expected in December 2012, with rates becoming effective on January 2, 2013. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any electric service rate change the MoPSC may approve or whether any rate increase that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the increase goes into effect.
 
As used in this Schedule 6 "FAC" means a fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism that allows Ameren Missouri to recover, through customer rates, 95% of changes in fuel (coal, coal transportation, natural gas for generation, and nuclear), emission allowances and purchased power costs, net of off-system revenues, including MISO (Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., a Regional Transmission Organization) costs and revenues, greater or less than the amount set in base rates, without a traditional rate proceeding.
MEEIA Filing
In August 2012, the MoPSC issued an order that approved a stipulation and agreement between Ameren Missouri, MoPSC staff, and other parties. The order includes megawatthour savings targets for Ameren Missouri's energy efficiency programs as well as associated cost recovery mechanisms and incentive awards. The order provides that, beginning in 2013, Ameren Missouri will invest approximately $147 million over three years for energy efficiency programs. The order allows for Ameren Missouri to collect, over the next three years, its program costs and 90% of its projected lost revenue from customers starting on the expected effective date for the pending electric service rate case, which is expected to be January 2, 2013. The remaining 10% of projected lost revenue is expected to be recovered as part of future rate proceedings.
Additionally, the order provides for an incentive award that would allow Ameren Missouri to earn additional revenues based on achievement of certain energy efficiency goals, including approximately $19 million if 100% of its energy efficiency goals are achieved during the three-year period, with the potential to earn more if Ameren Missouri's energy savings exceed those goals. Ameren Missouri must achieve at least 70% of its energy efficiency goals before it earns any incentive award. The recovery of the incentive award from customers, if the energy efficiency goals are achieved, would begin after the three-year energy efficiency plan is complete and upon the effective date of an electric service rate case or potentially with the future adoption of a rider mechanism.
The MoPSC's order will not affect Ameren Missouri rates until these rates are included in an electric service rate case. The impacts of the MoPSC's order in this MEEIA filing are expected to be included in rates set under Ameren Missouri's pending electric service rate case that was filed in February 2012. Ameren Missouri's pending electric service rate case includes an annual revenue increase request of $80 million related to its planned portfolio of energy efficiency programs included in its MEEIA filing.

EXHIBIT A
To the Lenders and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Agent
383 Madison Avenue
New York, NY 10179
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
I, Gregory L. Nelson, am the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Ameren Corporation, a Missouri corporation (the ""), and its subsidiary Union Electric Company, d/b/a Ameren Missouri, a Missouri corporation ("" and together with the Company, the "" and each a ""). I, or lawyers under my direction, have acted as counsel for each of the Borrowers in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of November 14, 2012 (the ""), among the Borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Agent. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
Company
UE
Borrowers
Borrower
Credit Agreement
Lenders
In rendering the opinion expressed below, I, or lawyers under my direction, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
In making the examinations described above, I have assumed without independent investigation the capacity of natural persons (other than the office held by each representative of the Borrowers) as reflected adjacent to such individual's signature on the Credit Agreement and the Notes (each a "" and collectively, the ""), the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of representatives of the Borrowers appearing on the Loan Documents), the authenticity of all documents furnished to me as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents furnished to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. In addition, I have assumed without independent investigation that (i) the Loan Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Lenders and the Agent, and constitute their valid, lawful and binding obligation and agreement, and (ii) there is no separate agreement, undertaking, or course of dealing modifying, varying or waiving any of the terms of the Loan Documents. As to matters of fact not independently established by me relevant to the opinions set forth herein, I have relied without independent investigation on the representations contained in the Loan Documents and in certificates of public officials and responsible representatives of each Borrower furnished to me; , , that I advise that in the course of my representation of the Borrowers, I obtained no information that leads me to believe that any such representation or certificate is untrue or misleading in any material respect.
Loan Document
Loan Documents
provided
however
Upon the basis of and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. Each of the Borrowers is a corporation, duly and properly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Missouri and has all requisite authority to conduct its business as presently conducted in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted, other than the failure of any such Borrower to be qualified to transact business in any such jurisdiction to the extent such failure could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
2. Each of the Borrowers has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Loan Documents. The execution and delivery by each of the Borrowers of the Loan Documents, and the performance by each of the Borrowers of its obligations under the Loan Documents, have been duly authorized by proper proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
3. Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrowers of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor the performance by the Borrowers of the obligations thereunder, (x) violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on such Borrower or (ii) such Borrower's articles or certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, any material instrument or any material agreement to which such Borrower is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or (y) conflict with, or constitute a default under, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of such Borrower pursuant to the terms of, any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by such Borrower, is required to be obtained by such Borrower in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings and issuances of Letters of Credit for account of such Borrower under the Loan Documents, the payment and performance by such Borrower of its Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents with respect to such Borrower.
4. Except for the Disclosed Matters, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry currently existing, or, to the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, pending or threatened against or affecting the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, which, if determined adversely to such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Loans or would adversely effect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents as to such Borrower or the ability of such Borrower to perform the transactions contemplated therein.
5. No Borrower is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
6. The Company is a "holding company" and UE is a "public utility," as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. The FERC, in accordance with Section 204 of the Federal Power Act, has issued a FERC Order dated April 9, 2012, with respect to UE, which is in full force and effect, authorizing the incurrence of short-term indebtedness by UE in an aggregate principal amount outstanding not to exceed $1 billion. The authorization under the April 9, 2012 FERC Order expires March 31, 2014. Unless such authorization is no longer required by applicable laws and regulations, additional authorization from the FERC (or any governmental agency that succeeds to the authority of the FERC) or the Missouri Public Service Commission will be necessary for UE to obtain any Advances under the Credit Agreement or to incur or issue short-term indebtedness, including Advances extended under the Credit Agreement, after March 31, 2014. No regulatory authorizations, approvals, consents, registrations, declarations or filings are required in connection with the borrowings by, and issuances of Letters of Credit for the account of, the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement or the performance by each Borrower of its Obligations under the Credit Agreement and under the other Loan Documents, except as set forth above or where the failure to have obtained, made or maintained any such authorizations, approvals, consents, registrations, declarations or filings could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Borrower.
7. In a properly presented case, a Missouri court or a federal court applying Missouri choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents and should hold that the Loan Documents are to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Missouri. In rendering the foregoing opinion, I note that by their terms the Loan Documents expressly select New York law as the law governing their interpretation. The choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents are not voidable under the laws of the State of Missouri. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Missouri court or a federal court holds that the Loan Documents are to be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, the Loan Documents would constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the Borrowers, enforceable under Missouri law (including usury provisions) against such Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
I express no opinion as to the compliance or noncompliance, or the effect of the compliance or noncompliance, of any addressee with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to it by reason of its status as or affiliation with a federally insured depository institution.
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Missouri and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Missouri and the Federal laws of the United States of America. I note that the Loan Documents are governed by the laws of the State of New York and, for purposes of the opinion expressed in opinion paragraph 2 above and with your permission, I have assumed that the laws of the State of New York do not differ from the laws of the State of Missouri in any manner that would render such opinion incorrect. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person (other than your successors and assigns as Lenders) without my prior written
 
consent. Notwithstanding anything in this opinion letter to the contrary, you may disclose this opinion (i) to prospective successors and assigns of the addressees hereof, (ii) to regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over any of the addressees hereof or their successors and assigns, and (iii) pursuant to valid legal process, in each case without my prior consent.
 
This opinion is delivered as of the date hereof and I undertake no, and disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in matters of law or fact set forth herein or upon which this opinion is based.

Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions
 
governmental authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or impose upon such Issuing Bank any restriction, reserve or capital requirement with respect to such Letter of Credit not in effect on the Closing Date for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated (or assured to its satisfaction that it will be compensated) hereunder or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense not applicable to such Issuing Bank on the Closing Date, which such Issuing Bank deems in good faith to be material to it and for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated (or assured to its satisfaction that it will be compensated) hereunder or (z) for Letters of Credit to be issued jointly for the account of either Borrower and any of its subsidiaries in accordance with Section 2.6(a), the applicable Issuing Bank has not received documentation that it shall have reasonably requested in order to comply with its obligations under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act, with respect to such subsidiaries. If the Required Lenders notify the Issuing Banks that a Default exists with respect to a requesting Borrower and instruct the Issuing Banks to suspend the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of Letters of Credit for the account of such Borrower, no Issuing Bank shall issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit for the account of such Borrower or the Company without the consent of the Required Lenders until such notice is withdrawn by the Required Lenders (and each Lender that shall have delivered such notice agrees promptly to withdraw it at such time as no Default exists).

(d) . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the applicable Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations
(e) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower for the account such Letter of Credit was issued, severally and not jointly with the other Borrower, shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by such Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, such Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.1 or 2.5 that such payment be financed with a Floating Rate Advance or a Swingline Loan to such Borrower in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Floating Rate Advance or Swingline Loan. If such Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Agent its Pro Rata Share of the payment then due from such Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.11 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.11 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall promptly pay to such Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Agent of any payment from such Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Agent shall distribute such payment to such Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of a Floating Rate Advance or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
Reimbursement
provided
mutatis
mutandis
 
(f) . Each Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section in respect of Letters of Credit issued for its account shall be several and not joint with the other Borrower, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower's obligations hereunder. None of the Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers or employees, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to a Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's wrongful honor or rejection of any drawing under such Letter of Credit to the extent arising out of the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, but subject to any non-waivable provisions of the laws and/or other rules to which a Letter of Credit is subject, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
Obligations Absolute
provided
(g) . The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
 
(h) . If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of any Letter of Credit, then, unless the Borrower for the account of which such Letter of Credit was issued shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Floating Rate Advances; that, if such Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.14 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest
provided
(i) . If (i) a Default under Section 7.2 with respect to a Borrower shall occur and be continuing or (ii) any other Default with respect to a Borrower shall occur and be continuing and the Required Lenders shall have terminated the Commitments insofar as they are available to such Borrower or accelerated the maturity of any Loans of such Borrower, in either case as a result of such Default (and unless and until any such termination or acceleration has been rescinded), then on the Business Day that such Borrower receives notice from the Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, such Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Agent, in the name of the Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 101% of the portion of the LC Exposure as of such date attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower; that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Default with respect to such Borrower described in Section 7.6 or 7.7. Such deposit shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations of such Borrower under this Agreement. The Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made only if and to the extent requested by such Borrower and then only at the option and sole discretion of the Agent, and all at such Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements under outstanding Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of future reimbursement obligations under Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of such Lenders with LC Exposures representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations of such Borrower under this Agreement. If either Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of any event specified in clause (i) or (ii) above with respect to such Borrower, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to such Borrower within three Business Days after all Defaults with respect to such Borrower have been cured or waived and, if Loans or other Obligations (other than any unasserted contingent indemnity claims) of such Borrower have been accelerated, all such Loans and other Obligations of such Borrower have been repaid (or such acceleration has been
Cash Collateralization
provided
 
rescinded). If at any time the cash collateral of either Borrower shall exceed 101% of such portion of the LC Exposure as of such date attributable to Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, the Agent shall apply such excess funds to the payment of such Borrower's Obligations or (x) if no such Obligations are then due and owing and no Default with respect to such Borrower shall exist, shall release such excess funds to such Borrower or (y) if no such Obligations are outstanding (other than contingent Obligations in respect of Letters of Credit which are fully collateralized and unasserted contingent indemnification claims), such excess amount shall be released to such Borrower notwithstanding the existence of a Default in respect of such Borrower.
(j) . From time to time, the Borrowers may by notice to the Agent and the Lenders designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below. The acceptance by a Lender of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an agreement (an ""), which shall be in a form satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Agent, shall set forth the LC Commitment of such Lender and shall be executed by such Lender, the Borrowers and the Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as an Issuing Bank. If the Commitment Termination Date shall be extended beyond the LC Commitment Termination Date of any Issuing Bank that is a Declining Lender, the appointment of such Issuing Bank shall be terminated effective as of the Existing Commitment Termination Date, at which time the Borrowers shall pay any unpaid fees accrued for the account of the terminated Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.8.2. Notwithstanding the effectiveness of any such termination, the terminated Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all rights as an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not issue any additional Letters of Credit.

(c) In the event that the Agent, each Borrower, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans (other than Competitive Loans and Swingline Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements of the other Lenders as the Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Pro Rata Share.
(d) Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.25 in connection with the obligations of the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Banks, the obligation of each Lender, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender to fund the full amount of its Commitment and to make Loans, Advances and other extensions of credit hereunder shall not be released or diminished in any respect by any other Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender.

The decision of any Lender to become an Augmenting Lender shall be at the sole discretion of such Lender.

Taxes
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of each Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by each Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by either Borrower to a governmental authority pursuant to this Section 3.5, such Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such governmental authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 20 days after written demand therefor (in each case setting forth the basis therefor and the manner of determination thereof), for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.1(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable
 
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant governmental authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender, as applicable, by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this Section 3.5(d)
(e) (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times set forth herein or as are reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 3.5(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

provided
(C) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to each Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter as set forth herein or upon the reasonable request of either Borrower or the Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers and the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to each Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by either Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by either Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.5 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.5), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 3.5 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 3.5(f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.5(f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 3.5(f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 3.5(f) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(g) Each party's obligations under this Section 3.5 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender and the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
(h) For purposes of this Section 3.5, (i) the term "Lender" includes any applicable Lending Installation and any Issuing Bank and (ii) the term "applicable law" includes FATCA.
3.6. . The Agent, each Lender or each Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall deliver a written statement to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) as to each amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth an explanation in reasonable detail of the manner in which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on such Borrower in the absence of manifest error, and upon the reasonable request of such Borrower, such Lender shall promptly provide supporting documentation describing and/or evidencing the applicable event giving rise to such amount to the extent not inconsistent with such Lender's policies or applicable law. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type, currency and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable within fifteen (15) days (or, in the case of Section 3.5, twenty (20) days) after receipt by the applicable Borrower of such written statement, unless subject to a

good faith dispute by such Borrower, notice and details of which were provided to the affected Lender prior to such due date. The obligations of each Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Borrowers shall not be responsible for any reimbursement of any such amount under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5 which shall have accrued and of which the Agent or the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have become aware more than 180 days prior to its delivery to the Borrower of notice requesting reimbursement thereof and (b) none of the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank will make any claim (nor shall any Borrower have any liability) under Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 unless the Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall have determined that the making of such claim is consistent with its general practices under similar circumstances in respect of similarly situated borrowers under credit agreements entitling it to make such claims.
3.7. . To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. A Lender's designation of an alternative Lending Installation shall not affect the Borrowers' rights under Section 2.22 to replace a Lender.
Alternative Lending Installation
3.8. . Each amount payable by "the Borrowers" under this Article shall be an obligation of, and shall be discharged by (a) to the extent arising out of acts, events and circumstances related to a particular Borrower, such Borrower and (b) otherwise, both Borrowers, with each Borrower being severally liable for such Borrower's Contribution Percentage of such amount, that the Company agrees that, if the Borrowing Subsidiary shall fail to pay any amount owed by it under clause (b) of this Section after a demand shall have been made by the Person to which such amount is owed, the Company shall promptly pay such amount (the Company hereby irrevocably waiving any defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor of the obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary under this Section).

If any other Default occurs with respect to a Borrower, the Required Lenders (or the Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the obligations of the
Acceleration
 
Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit hereunder to such Borrower, or declare the Obligations of such Borrower (and, in the case of a Default with respect to a Borrowing Subsidiary, of the Company) to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations of such Borrower (and, in the case of a Default with respect to the Borrowing Subsidiary, of the Company) shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which such Borrower hereby expressly waives.
If, after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to such Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Agent shall, by notice to such Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination.
8.2. . None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each Borrower, the Agent and the Required Lenders and, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Agent and the other party or parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; that (i) any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by each Borrower and the Agent to correct any administrative or other manifest error, omission, defect or inconsistency so long as, in each case, the Lenders shall have received at least seven Business Days' prior written notice thereof and the Agent shall not have received, within seven Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such amendment and (ii) no such agreement shall (A) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (B) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (C) except as expressly otherwise provided herein, postpone the scheduled maturity date of any Loan or LC Disbursement or any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (D) change Section 11.2 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, (E) change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify, extend or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of the Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.
Amendments
provided
provided
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the applicable Borrower, the Required Lenders and the Agent if, by the terms of such agreement, (i) the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment
 
and (ii) upon the effectiveness of such amendment, each Lender not consenting to such amendment shall receive payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Advance made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.
8.3. . No omission of the Lenders, the Agent or the Issuing Banks to exercise or delay in exercising any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding the existence of a Default or Unmatured Default or the inability of a Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Credit Extension shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by, or by the Agent with the consent of, the requisite number of Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders until all of the Obligations have been paid in full.

Headings
9.4. . The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding among the Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders, and between the Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders on one hand, and the Borrowers individually on the other hand, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among and between such parties, as the case may be, relating to the subject matter thereof (but do not supersede (a) any provisions of the fee letters related to the credit facilities established hereby or (b) the indemnification and reimbursement provisions of any commitment letter related to the credit facilities established hereby to the extent applicable to the Arrangers and the Initial Lenders (as such terms are defined therein) in their capacities as such, that in each case do not by the terms of such documents terminate upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect).
Entire Agreement
 
9.5. . The respective obligations of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of the Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve the Agent, any other Lender or any Issuing Bank of any of its obligations hereunder.

If any changes in generally accepted
Accounting
 
accounting principles are hereafter required or permitted and are adopted by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with the agreement of its independent certified public accountants and such changes result in a change in the method of calculation of any of the financial covenants, tests, restrictions or standards herein or in the related definitions or terms used therein (""), the parties hereto agree, at the request of such Borrower, the Agent or the Required Lenders, to enter into negotiations, in good faith, in order to amend such provisions in a credit neutral manner so as to reflect equitably such changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating such Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' financial condition shall be the same after such changes as if such changes had not been made; , until such provisions are amended in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company, the Agent and the Required Lenders, no Accounting Change shall be given effect in such calculations. In the event such amendment is entered into, all references in this Agreement to Agreement Accounting Principles shall mean generally accepted accounting principles as of the date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all financial statements to be delivered by such Borrower pursuant to Section 6.1 shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect at such time (subject in the case of interim financial statements, to the absence of footnotes and year-end adjustments).

Nonliability
 
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought or (b) the material breach by the party from which recovery is sought of its agreements hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (it being agreed, however, that no such breach shall be deemed to occur as a result of any reasonable assertion in good faith by the Agent, any Arranger, any Issuing Bank or any Lender that any condition to any of its obligations hereunder has not been satisfied). None of the Borrowers, the Agent, any Arranger, any Issuing Bank or any Lender shall have any liability for, and each of the Agent, each Arranger, each Issuing Bank, each Lender and each Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in connection with, arising out of or in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby; , that each Borrower shall be obligated as, and subject to the limitations, provided in Section 9.6 to indemnify the Agent, each Arranger, each Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, each Lender and their Related Parties against any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages that may be awarded against them.

10.2. . The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent shall have no implied duties or fiduciary duties to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any obligation to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in the event that and to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires such), and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders and each Issuing Bank. The Lenders and each Issuing Bank hereby acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in the event that and to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires such).

In the event that the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks.
Notice of Default
10.10. .

The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with each Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which such Borrower or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender.
Rights as a Lender
10.11. . Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender or any other Issuing Bank and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrowers and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Borrowers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; that such consent shall not be required in the event and continuation of a Default), shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders or consented to by the Borrowers within thirty days after the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrowers or any Lender or any Issuing Bank, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the Agent has resigned and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Required Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrowers shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lenders and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. If the Agent has resigned and, at such time, holds cash collateral under this Agreement, the Agent shall continue to hold such cash collateral for the benefit of the Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank until a successor Agent has been appointed. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has accepted the appointment. Unless otherwise agreed by the Company, any such successor Agent shall be a Lender or, if no Lender will accept such appointment, a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $1,000,000,000 (or such lower amount as shall be acceptable to the Company). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the resigning Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

Illinois Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act ("IEIMA")
On January 3, 2012, Ameren Illinois Company elected to participate in the performance-based formula ratemaking process established pursuant to the IEIMA by filing initial performance-based formula rates with the Illinois Commerce Commission (the ""). The initial filing was based on 2010 recoverable costs and expected net plant additions for 2011 and 2012. In September 2012, the ICC issued an order approving an Ameren Illinois Company electric delivery service revenue requirement of $779 million, which is a $55 million decrease from the electric delivery service revenue requirement allowed in the pre-IEIMA 2010 electric delivery service rate order. The rates became effective on October 19, 2012, and will be effective through the end of 2012. Ameren Illinois Company requested a rehearing of the initial filing order, which the ICC denied. In October 2012, Ameren Illinois Company filed an appeal of the ICC order to the Appellate Court of the Fourth District of Illinois. A decision by the appellate court is expected in 2013. Ameren Illinois Company believes that the ICC misapplied Illinois law, through including the use of an average rate base as opposed to a year-end rate base, the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes, the method for calculating the equity portion of Ameren Illinois Company's capital structure, and the method for calculating interest on the revenue requirement reconciliation.
ICC
The ICC's September 2012 order jeopardizes Ameren Illinois Company's ongoing ability to implement infrastructure improvements to the extent and on the timetable envisioned in the IEIMA. Until the uncertainty surrounding how the Illinois law will ultimately be implemented is removed, Ameren Illinois Company is reducing its IEIMA capital spending with a corresponding negative effect on the job creation that the legislature sought to achieve with the law. Ameren Illinois Company expects to reduce or defer a total of $30 million of its previously planned 2013 electric distribution capital expenditures.
On April 20, 2012, Ameren Illinois Company filed a request with the ICC to update its annual electric delivery service revenue requirement based on 2011 recoverable costs and expected net plant additions for 2012. The update filing will result in new electric delivery service rates on January 1, 2013. The update filing, as amended in September 2012, requested an annual revenue requirement of $796 million, which would result in an annual increase of $17 million in Ameren Illinois Company's revenues for electric delivery service above the amount allowed in the ICC initial filing order. The requested increase primarily reflects higher recoverable operating expenses, higher taxes, and a higher equity portion of the capital structure offset by a lower return on equity due to decreases in the average 30-year United States treasury bond rates. In September 2012, the ICC staff recommended a $765 million electric delivery service revenue requirement, which is $14 million below the amount allowed in the ICC initial filing order. Other parties also made recommendations through testimony filed in Ameren Illinois Company's update filing. On November 7, 2012, the administrative law judges issued a proposed order that reflected an annual revenue requirement of $764 million, which would result in an annual decrease of $15 million in Ameren Illinois Company's revenues for electric delivery service below the amount allowed in the ICC initial filing order.
 
The IEIMA provides for an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement necessary to reflect the actual costs incurred in a given year with the revenue requirement that was in effect for that year. Consequently, Ameren Illinois Company's 2012 electric delivery service revenues will be based on its 2012 actual recoverable costs, rate base, and return on common equity as calculated under the IEIMA's performance-based formula ratemaking framework. The 2012 revenue requirement under the IEIMA's formula ratemaking framework is expected to be lower than the revenue requirement included in both the ICC's 2010 electric rate order and the ICC's September 2012 order related to Ameren Illinois Company's initial IEIMA filing. As a result, Ameren Illinois Company recorded a regulatory liability to represent its estimate of the probable decrease in electric delivery service rates expected to be approved by the ICC to provide Ameren Illinois Company recovery of all prudently and reasonably incurred costs and an earned rate of return on common equity for 2012. Ameren Illinois Company's actual return on equity relating to electric delivery service cannot exceed 50 basis points above or below its allowed return. During the third quarter of 2012, Ameren Illinois Company's electric delivery service return on equity was capped at the maximum allowed return on equity based on the IEIMA formula ratemaking framework. As of September 30, 2012, Ameren Illinois Company recorded a cumulative regulatory liability of $35 million with a corresponding decrease in electric revenues for electric delivery service relating to the 2012 revenue requirement reconciliation and the return on equity collar, which will be refunded to customers during 2014 with interest pursuant to the provisions of the IEIMA.
The IEIMA requires Ameren Illinois Company to obtain ICC approval of its advanced metering infrastructure deployment plan. The advanced metering infrastructure deployment plan outlines how Ameren Illinois Company will comply with the IEIMA requirement to spend $360 million on smart grid assets over ten years on a cost-beneficial basis to its electric customers. In March 2012, Ameren Illinois Company submitted its advanced metering infrastructure deployment plan to the ICC, and the ICC subsequently denied that plan in May 2012. The ICC ruled that Ameren Illinois Company's plan did not provide enough support to prove that it was cost beneficial for electric customers. Ameren Illinois Company requested and received a rehearing from the ICC. In its rehearing request, Ameren Illinois Company submitted a modified advance metering infrastructure deployment plan designed to address the ICC's concerns about the cost justification of the plan. Ameren Illinois Company expects the ICC will issue an order later this year. If approved, the plan targets the second quarter of 2014 to begin installation of smart meters. If an advanced metering infrastructure deployment plan is ultimately not approved by the ICC, Ameren Illinois Company may be precluded from using the IEIMA's performance-based formula rates.

In rendering the opinion expressed below, I, or lawyers under my direction, have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
In making the examinations described above, I have assumed without independent investigation the capacity of natural persons (other than the office held by each representative of the Company) as reflected adjacent to such individual's signature on the Credit Agreement and the Notes (each a "" and collectively, the ""), the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of representatives of the Company appearing on the Loan Documents), the authenticity of all documents furnished to me as originals, the conformity to originals of all documents furnished to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents. In addition, I have assumed without independent investigation that (i) the Loan Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto other than the Company, and constitute their valid, lawful and binding obligations and agreements, and (ii) there is no separate agreement, undertaking, or course of dealing modifying, varying or waiving any of the terms of the Loan Documents. As to matters of fact not independently established by me relevant to the opinions set forth herein, I have relied without independent investigation on the representations contained in the Loan Documents and in certificates of public officials and responsible representatives of the Company furnished to me; , , that I advise that in the course of my representation of the Company, I have obtained no information that leads me to believe that any such representation or certificate is untrue or misleading in any material respect.

however
Upon the basis of and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company is a corporation, duly and properly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Missouri and has all requisite authority to conduct its business as presently conducted in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted, other than the failure of the Company to be qualified to transact business in any such jurisdiction to the extent such failure could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
2. The Company has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Loan Documents. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by proper proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which the Company is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
3. Neither the execution and delivery by the Company of the Loan Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, (x) violate (i) any law, rule or regulation of the State of Missouri or the United States of America, or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Company, (ii) the Company's articles of incorporation or by-laws, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, material instrument or material agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or (y) conflict with, or constitute a default under, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Company pursuant to the terms of, any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by the Company, is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings and issuances of Letters of Credit for the account of the Company under the Loan Documents, the payment and performance by the Company of the obligations thereunder or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability as to the Company of any of the Loan Documents.
4. Except for the Disclosed Matters, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry currently existing, or, to the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, pending or threatened against or affecting the Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries, which, if determined adversely to such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Borrower or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of the Loans or would adversely effect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents as to such Borrower or the ability of such Borrower to perform the transactions contemplated therein.
 
5. No Borrower is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
6. The Company is a "holding company" and Ameren Illinois is a "public utility," as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. The FERC, in accordance with Section 204 of the Federal Power Act, has issued a FERC Order dated September 20, 2012, with respect to Ameren Illinois, which is in full force and effect, authorizing the incurrence of short-term indebtedness by Ameren Illinois in an aggregate principal amount outstanding not to exceed $1 billion. The authorization under the September 20, 2012 FERC Order expires September 30, 2014 and, unless such authorization is no longer required by applicable laws and regulations, additional authorization from the FERC (or any governmental agency that succeeds to the authority of the FERC) or the Illinois Commerce Commission will be necessary for Ameren Illinois to obtain any Advances under the Credit Agreement or to incur or issue short-term indebtedness, including Advances extended under the Credit Agreement, after September 30, 2014. No regulatory authorizations, approvals, consents, registrations, declarations or filings are required in connection with the borrowings by, and issuances of Letters of Credit for the account of, the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement or the performance by each Borrower of its Obligations under the Credit Agreement and under the other Loan Documents, except as set forth above or where the failure to have obtained, made or maintained any such authorizations, approvals, consents, registrations, declarations or filings could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Borrower.
7. In a properly presented case, a Missouri court or a federal court applying Missouri choice of law rules should give effect to the choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents and should hold that the Loan Documents are to be governed by the laws of the State of New York rather than the laws of the State of Missouri. In rendering the foregoing opinion, I note that by their terms the Loan Documents expressly select New York law as the law governing their interpretation. The choice of law provisions of the Loan Documents are not voidable under the laws of the State of Missouri. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a Missouri court or a federal court holds that the Loan Documents are to be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, the Loan Documents would constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company under Missouri law (including usury provisions) in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, or similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.
I express no opinion as to the compliance or noncompliance, or the effect of the compliance or noncompliance, of any addressee with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to it by reason of its status as or affiliation with a federally insured depository institution.
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Missouri and the foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Missouri and the Federal laws of the United States of America typically relevant to a transaction of this type. I note that the Loan Documents are governed by the laws of the State of New York and, for purposes of the opinion expressed in opinion paragraph 2 above and with
 
your permission, I have assumed that the laws of the State of New York do not differ from the laws of the State of Missouri in any manner that would render such opinion incorrect. This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by any other Person (other than your successors and assigns as Lenders) without my prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything in this opinion letter to the contrary, you may disclose this opinion (i) to prospective successors and assigns of the addressees hereof, (ii) to regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over any of the addressees hereof or their successors and assigns, and (iii) pursuant to valid legal process, in each case without my prior consent.
 
This opinion is delivered as of the date hereof and I undertake no, and disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in matters of law or fact set forth herein or upon which this opinion is based.
