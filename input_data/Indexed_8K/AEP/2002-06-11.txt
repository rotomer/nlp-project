7. Indemnification and Contribution: (a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold you harmless and each person, if any, who controls you within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which you, they or any of you or them may become subject under the Act or otherwise, and to reimburse you and such controlling person or persons, if any, for any legal or other expenses incurred by you or them in connection with defending any action, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any alleged untrue statement or untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, in the Basic Prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of this Agreement), or in the Prospectus, or if the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to you any amendments or any supplements to the Prospectus, in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented except to the extent that such amendments or supplements relate solely to securities other than the Securities (provided that if such Prospectus or such Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, is used after the period of time referred to in Section 4(b) hereof, it shall contain such amendments or supplements as the Company deems necessary to comply with Section 10(a) of the Act), or arise out of or are based upon any alleged omission or omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such alleged untrue statement or omission, or untrue statement or omission which was made in the Registration Statement, in the Basic Prospectus or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or through the Representatives expressly for use therein or with any statements in or omissions from that part of the Registration Statement that shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility under the Trust Indenture Act of any indenture trustee under an indenture of the Company, and except that this indemnity shall not inure to your benefit (or of any person controlling you) on account of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arising from the sale of the Securities to any person if such loss arises from the fact that a copy of the Prospectus, as the same may then be supplemented or amended to the extent such Prospectus was provided to you by the Company (excluding, however, any document then incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference), was not sent or given by you to such person with or prior to the written confirmation of the sale involved and the alleged omission or alleged untrue statement or omission or untrue statement was corrected in the Prospectus as supplemented or amended at the time of such confirmation, and such Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, was timely delivered to you by the Company prior to the written confirmation of the sale involved. You agree promptly after the receipt by you of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 7(a) may be sought by you, or by any person controlling you, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof, but your omission so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to you or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(a). In case any such action shall be brought against you or any such person controlling you and you shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof, as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel (such 12
counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party), to direct the defense thereof at its own expense. In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel (hereinafter, Company's counsel), you or any controlling person shall have the right to employ your own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at your expense unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both you or any controlling person and the Company and you or any controlling person shall have been advised by your counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and you or any controlling person may arise (and the Company's counsel shall have concurred in good faith with such advice) and for this reason it is not desirable for the Company's counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for you or any controlling person (plus any local counsel retained by you or any controlling person in their reasonable judgment), which firm (or firms) shall be designated in writing by you or any controlling person). (b) Each Underwriter agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 7(a) hereof, but only with respect to untrue statements or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions made in the Registration Statement, or in the Basic Prospectus, or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein. The Company agrees promptly after the receipt by it of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from you on account of your agreement contained in this Section 7(b) may be sought by the Company, or by any person controlling the Company, to notify you in writing of the commencement thereof, but the Company's omission so to notify you of any such action shall not release you from any liability which you may have to the Company or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(b). (c) If recovery is not available or insufficient under Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof for any reason other than as specified therein, the indemnified party shall be entitled to contribution for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification is so unavailable or insufficient under this Section 7(c). In determining the amount of contribution to which such indemnified party is entitled, there shall be considered the portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Securities realized, the relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such 13
purpose) without reference to the considerations called for in the previous sentence. No Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter shall be obligated to contribute any amount or amounts hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total price of the Securities purchased by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. An Underwriter's obligation to contribute under this Section 7 is in proportion to its purchase obligation and not joint with any other Underwriter. (d) No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which contribution could be sought under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party. (e) In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent. The agreements contained in Section 7 hereof shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities hereunder. 8. Default of Underwriters: If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase and pay for the number of Securities which it has agreed to purchase and pay for hereunder, and the number of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the number of the Securities, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of Securities set forth opposite their names in Exhibit 1 hereto bear to the number of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein; provided that in no event shall the number of Securities which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. In the event of any such purchase, (a) the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to fix as a postponed Closing Date a date not exceeding four full business days after the date specified in Section 2 and (b) the 14
respective number of Securities to be purchased by the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be taken as the basis of their respective underwriting obligations for all purposes of this Agreement. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the number of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the number of the Securities then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter; provided, however, that the non-defaulting Underwriters may agree, in their sole discretion, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein. In the event of any such termination, the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter (except to the extent, if any, provided in Section 4(h) hereof), nor shall any Underwriter (other than an Underwriter who shall have failed or refused to purchase the Securities without some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, its termination of its obligations hereunder) be under any liability to the Company or any other Underwriter. Nothing herein contained shall release any defaulting Underwriter from its liability to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 9. Termination of Agreement by the Underwriters: This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Representatives if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, the Underwriters' ability to market the Securities shall have been materially adversely affected because: (a) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or (b) trading in the securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange, or (c) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other national or international calamity or crisis, or (d) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities. If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 9, the Representatives will promptly notify the Company by telephone or by telex or facsimile transmission, confirmed in writing. If this Agreement shall not be carried out by any Underwriter for any reason permitted hereunder, or if the sale of the Securities to the Underwriters as herein contemplated shall not be carried out because the Company is not able to comply with the terms hereof, the Company shall not be under any obligation under this Agreement and shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company shall remain liable to the 15
extent provided in Sections 4(g), 4(h) and 7 hereof) and the Underwriters shall be under no liability to the Company nor be under any liability under this Agreement to one another. 10.

EXHIBIT 1
EXHIBIT A-1 OPINION OF SIMPSON THACHER & BARTLETT (a) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of New York and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. (b) An appropriate order of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 has been obtained; such order is sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States federal or New York State governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the previsions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) not already obtained is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations with respect to the Securities and under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture. (c) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (d) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and, assuming that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. (e) The Forward Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized by the Company and, when validly executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming that the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. (f) The Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized by the Company and, when validly executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming that the Pledge Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Collateral Agent and the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Pledge Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms. (g) The Remarketing Agreement has been duly authorized by the Company and, when validly executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming that the Remarketing Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Remarketing Agent, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in A-1-1
accordance with its terms. (h) The Notes have been duly authorized and executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture. (i) The shares of Common Stock to be issued and sold by the Company pursuant to the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance upon settlement of the Forward Purchase Contracts and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. There are no preemptive rights under federal or New York law to subscribe for or to purchase such shares of Common Stock; there are no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase such shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company. (j) The Equity Units have been duly authorized, and, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, the Equity Units will be validly issued, and, assuming that the Forward Purchase Contracts and the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement are the valid and legally binding obligations of the Forward Purchase Contract Agent and the Forward Purchase Contracts have been duly authenticated by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Forward Purchase Contracts will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement; there are no preemptive rights under federal or New York law or under the Delaware General Corporation Law to subscribe for or to purchase Equity Units; there are no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase Equity Units pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company. (k) The issue and sale of the Securities by the Company and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the other Operative Documents will not violate any Federal or New York statute or any order known to us issued pursuant to any Federal or New York statute by any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties (except that various consents of, and filings with governmental authorities of, the State of New York may be required to be obtained or made, as the case may be, in connection or compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of the State of New York). (l) The statements made in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Equity Units," "Description of the Senior Notes" and "Description of the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Stock Purchase Units," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of documents referred to therein, constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such documents in all material respects. A-1-2
(m) Subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations therein, the statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax laws and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects. Our opinions set forth in paragraphs (d) - (h) above are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In addition, our opinion in paragraph (g) is further limited by considerations of public policy. Our opinion set forth in paragraph (m) above is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and other relevant authorities and law, all as in effect on the date hereof. Consequently, future changes in the law may cause the tax treatment of the transactions referred to herein to be materially different from that described above. We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs (l) and (m) above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents), we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with your representatives, with Underwriters' counsel, Dewey Ballantine LLP, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with other counsel to the Company. We did not prepare the Exchange Act Documents; however, we reviewed the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 prior to its filing with the Commission. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents) and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of June 5, 2002, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents complied as to form when filed in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) we have no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission on such effective date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained as of June 5, 2002 or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted as June 5, 2002 or omits to state any material A-1-3
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents. A-1-4
EXHIBIT A-2 OPINION OF THOMAS G. BERKEMEYER, ESQ. (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and the other Operative Documents and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated therein and compliance by the Company with their obligations thereunder do not and will not result in any violation of the charter or bylaws of the Company, will not result in the violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court having jurisdiction over the Company or its properties or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject (except for conflicts, breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the Company or materially adverse to the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the other Operative Documents). (b) The Company has full power and authority to execute and deliver the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, and the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company. (c) The Company has full power and authority to execute and deliver the Notes, and the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company. (d) The Company has full power and authority to execute and deliver the Equity Units, and the Equity Units have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company. (e) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (f) An appropriate order of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, has been obtained; such order is sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Securities by the Company; and the Commission has issued an appropriate order under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the sale of the Securities. No other approval or consent of any governmental body is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities to you or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the A-2-1
Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture. I have not considered whether any approval or consent is required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. A-2-2

(c) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (d) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and, assuming that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

(f) The Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized by the Company and, when validly executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming that the Pledge Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Collateral Agent and the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Pledge Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

In case any such action shall be brought against you or any such person controlling you and you shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof, as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party), to direct the defense thereof at its own expense. In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel (hereinafter, Company's counsel), you or any controlling person shall have the right to employ your own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at your expense unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both you or any controlling person and the Company and you or any controlling person shall have been advised by your counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and you or any controlling person may arise (and the Company's counsel shall have concurred in good faith with such advice) and for this reason it is not desirable for the Company's counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for you or any controlling person (plus any local counsel retained by you or any controlling person in their reasonable judgment), which firm (or firms) shall be designated in writing by you or any controlling person). (b) Each Underwriter agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 7(a) hereof, but only with respect to untrue statements or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions made in the Registration Statement, or in the Basic Prospectus, or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such 11
Underwriter expressly for use therein. The Company agrees promptly after the receipt by it of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from you on account of your agreement contained in this Section 7(b) may be sought by the Company, or by any person controlling the Company, to notify you in writing of the commencement thereof, but the Company's omission so to notify you of any such action shall not release you from any liability which you may have to the Company or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(b). (c) If recovery is not available or insufficient under Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof for any reason other than as specified therein, the indemnified party shall be entitled to contribution for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification is so unavailable or insufficient under this Section 7(c). In determining the amount of contribution to which such indemnified party is entitled, there shall be considered the portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Shares realized, the relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) without reference to the considerations called for in the previous sentence. No Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter shall be obligated to contribute any amount or amounts hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total price of the Shares purchased by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. An Underwriter's obligation to contribute under this Section 7 is in proportion to its purchase obligation and not joint with any other Underwriter. (d) No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which contribution could be sought under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party. (e) In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent. The agreements contained in Section 7 hereof shall remain in full force and effect 12
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Shares hereunder. 8. Default of Underwriters: If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase and pay for the number of Shares which it has agreed to purchase and pay for hereunder, and the number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the number of the Shares, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the number of Shares set forth opposite their names in Exhibit 1 hereto bear to the number of Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein; provided that in no event shall the number of Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. In the event of any such purchase, (a) the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to fix as a postponed Closing Date a date not exceeding four full business days after the date specified in Section 2 and (b) the respective number of Shares to be purchased by the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be taken as the basis of their respective underwriting obligations for all purposes of this Agreement. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the number of the Shares then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter; provided, however, that the non-defaulting Underwriters may agree, in their sole discretion, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein. In the event of any such termination, the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter (except to the extent, if any, provided in Section 4(h) hereof), nor shall any Underwriter (other than an Underwriter who shall have failed or refused to purchase the Shares without some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, its termination of its obligations hereunder) be under any liability to the Company or any other Underwriter. Nothing herein contained shall release any defaulting Underwriter from its liability to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 9. Termination of Agreement by the Underwriters: This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Representatives if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, the Underwriters' ability to market the Shares shall have been materially adversely affected because: (a) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or 13
(b) trading in the securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange, or (c) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other national or international calamity or crisis, or (d) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities. If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 9, the Representatives will promptly notify the Company by telephone or by telex or facsimile transmission, confirmed in writing. If this Agreement shall not be carried out by any Underwriter for any reason permitted hereunder, or if the sale of the Shares to the Underwriters as herein contemplated shall not be carried out because the Company is not able to comply with the terms hereof, the Company shall not be under any obligation under this Agreement and shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company shall remain liable to the extent provided in Sections 4(g), 4(h) and 7 hereof) and the Underwriters shall be under no liability to the Company nor be under any liability under this Agreement to one another. 10.

EXHIBIT 1
EXHIBIT A-1 OPINION OF SIMPSON THACHER & BARTLETT (a) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of New York and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. (b) An appropriate order of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 has been obtained; such order is sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States federal or New York State governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the previsions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) not already obtained is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations with respect to the Shares and under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture. (c) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (d) The Shares have been authorized by the Company, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. (e) There are no preemptive rights under federal or New York law to subscribe for or to purchase the Shares; there are no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company. (f) The issue and sale of the Shares by the Company and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement will not violate any Federal or New York statute or any order known to us issued pursuant to any Federal or New York statute by any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties (except that various consents of, and filings with governmental authorities of, the State of New York may be required to be obtained or made, as the case may be, in connection or compliance with the provisions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of the State of New York). (g) The statements made in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Common Stock," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Company's Common Stock (including the Shares), constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such Common Stock in all material respects. A-1-1
(h) Subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations therein, the statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax laws and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects. Our opinion set forth in paragraph (h) above is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and other relevant authorities and law, all as in effect on the date hereof. Consequently, future changes in the law may cause the tax treatment of the transactions referred to herein to be materially different from that described above. We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs (l) and (m) above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents), we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with your representatives, with Underwriters' counsel, Dewey Ballantine LLP, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with other counsel to the Company. We did not prepare the Exchange Act Documents; however, we reviewed the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 prior to its filing with the Commission. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents) and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of June 5, 2002, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents complied as to form when filed in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) we have no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission on such effective date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained as of June 5, 2002 or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted as June 5, 2002 or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents. A-1-2
EXHIBIT A-2 OPINION OF THOMAS G. BERKEMEYER, ESQ. (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance of the Shares and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated therein and compliance by the Company with their obligations thereunder do not and will not result in any violation of the charter or bylaws of the Company will not result in the violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court having jurisdiction over the Company or its properties or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject (except for conflicts, breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the Company or materially adverse to the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement). (b) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (c) An appropriate order of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, has been obtained; such order is sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company; and the Commission has issued an appropriate order under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the sale of the Shares. No other approval or consent of any governmental body is required for the issuance and sale of the Shares to you or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture. I have not considered whether any approval or consent is required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. A-2-1
EXHIBIT B OPINION OF DEWEY BALLANTINE LLP (a) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of New York and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. (b) An appropriate order of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 has been obtained; such order is sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States federal or New York State governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the previsions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) not already obtained is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations with respect to the Shares and under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture.

(d) The Shares have been authorized by the Company, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(f) The statements made in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Common Stock," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Company's Common Stock (including the Shares), constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such Common Stock in all material respects.

Section 3.9 Definitive Certificates. If 24
(i) a Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Equity Units and Stripped Units or ceases to be eligible as a "clearing agency" under the Exchange Act and a successor Clearing Agency is not appointed within 90 days after such discontinuance pursuant to Section 3.8, (ii) the Company elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency with respect to the Equity Units and Stripped Units, or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing a default by the Company in respect of its obligations under one or more Forward Purchase Contracts, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes, the Equity Units, the Pledge Agreement or any other principal agreements or instruments executed in connection with the offering of Equity Units then upon surrender of the Global Certificates representing the Book-Entry Interests with respect to the Equity Units and Stripped Units by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to be delivered to Clearing Agency Participants in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. The Company and the Agent shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on and shall be protected in relying on such instructions. Section 3.10 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Certificates. (a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate at the cost of the Holder, evidencing the same number of Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. (b) If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity at the cost of the Holder as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Agent that such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, a Certificate on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Stock Purchase Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Agent shall (i) if the Stock Purchase Date has occurred, 25
deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Forward Purchase Contracts forming a part of the Equity Units or Stripped Units evidenced by such Certificate, or (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Notes, the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article V. (d) Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Company and the Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Agent) connected therewith.

(f) The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. Section 3.11 Persons Deemed Owners. (a) Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered as the owner of the Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, for the purpose of receiving interest payments on the Notes, receiving payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, performance of the Forward Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever (subject to Section 4.1(a) and 5.2(a)), whether or not any such payments shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company nor the Agent, nor any agent of the Company or the Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Agent or any agent of the Company or the Agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any Clearing Agency (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Certificate or impair, as between such Clearing Agency and owners of beneficial interests in such Global Certificate, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of such Clearing Agency (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Certificate. None of the Company, the Agent, or any agent of the Company or the Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on 26
account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Certificate or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Section 3.12 Cancellation.

The Company may at any time deliver to the Agent for cancellation any Certificates previously authenticated, executed and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon Issuer Order, be promptly cancelled by the Agent. No Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Certificates cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All cancelled Certificates held by the Agent shall be disposed of by the Agent in accordance with its customary procedures. (b) If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate is cancelled or delivered to the Agent for cancellation. Section 3.13 Establishment of Stripped Units. (a) Unless a successful remarketing or a Tax Event Redemption has occurred, a Holder may separate the Pledged Notes from the related Forward Purchase Contracts in respect of the Equity Units held by such Holder by substituting for such Pledged Notes Treasury Securities that will pay, on the Stock Purchase Date, an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes (a "Collateral Substitution"), at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, by (i) depositing with the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of such Equity Units, and (ii) transferring the related Equity Units to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Treasury Securities to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Notes underlying such Equity Units, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may not separate the Pledged Notes from the related Forward Purchase Contracts in respect of the Equity Units held by such Holder during the periods beginning on the fourth Business Day prior to any Remarketing Period and ending on the third Business Day after the end of such Remarketing Period. Upon receipt of the Treasury Securities described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the 27
Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Notes from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Equity Units; (ii) transfer the Pledged Notes to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver to such Holder a Stripped Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 evidencing the same number of Forward Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Equity Units. (b) Holders who elect to separate the Pledged Notes from the related Forward Purchase Contract and to substitute Treasury Securities for such Pledged Notes shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent in respect of the substitution, and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees or expenses. (c) Holders may make Collateral Substitutions if Treasury Securities are being substituted for Pledged Notes, only in integral multiples of 20 Equity Units. (d) In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.13 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Equity Units or fails to deliver an Equity Units Certificate to the Agent after depositing Treasury Securities with the Collateral Agent, the Pledged Notes constituting a part of such Equity Units, and any distributions on such Pledged Notes shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Equity Units are so transferred or the Equity Units Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to an Equity Units Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Agent that such Equity Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. (e) Except as described in this Section 3.13, for so long as the Forward Purchase Contract underlying an Equity Unit remains in effect, such Equity Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Equity Unit in respect of the Note or the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the Forward Purchase Contract comprising such Equity Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as an Equity Unit. Section 3.14 Reestablishment of Equity Units. (a) Unless a successful remarketing or a Tax Event Redemption has occurred, a Holder of Stripped Units may reestablish Equity Units at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, by (i) depositing with the Collateral Agent the Notes then comprising such number of Equity Units as is equal to such Stripped Units and (ii) transferring such Stripped Units to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form 28
of Exhibit D hereto, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Notes to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying such Stripped Units, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder may not reestablish Equity Units during the periods beginning on the fourth Business Day prior to any Remarketing Period and ending on the third Business Day after the end of such Remarketing Period. Upon receipt of the Notes described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Treasury Securities from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Stripped Units; (ii) transfer the Pledged Treasury Securities to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver an Equity Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 evidencing the same number of Forward Purchase Contracts as were evidenced by the cancelled Stripped Units. (b) Holders of Stripped Units may reestablish Equity Units only in integral multiples of 20 Stripped Units for 20 Equity Units. (c) Except as provided in this Section 3.14, for so long as the Forward Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and Forward Purchase Contract comprising such Stripped Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Stripped Unit. (d) Holders of Stripped Units who reestablish Equity Units shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent in respect of the substitution, and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees or expenses. (e) In the event a Holder who reestablishes Equity Units pursuant to this Section 3.14 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Stripped Units or fails to deliver a Stripped Units Certificate to the Agent after depositing Pledged Notes with the Collateral Agent, the Treasury Securities constituting a part of such Stripped Units, and any distributions on such Treasury Securities shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Stripped Units are so transferred or the Stripped Units Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to a Stripped Units Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Agent that such Stripped Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. 29
Section 3.15 Transfer of Collateral Upon Occurrence of Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event and the transfer to the Agent by the Collateral Agent of the Notes, the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying the Equity Units or the Stripped Units, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent shall request transfer instructions with respect to such Notes or the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from each Holder by written request mailed to such Holder at its address as it appears in the Equity Units Register or the Stripped Units Register, as the case may be. Upon book-entry transfer of the Equity Units or Stripped Units or delivery of an Equity Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate to the Agent with such transfer instructions, the Agent shall transfer the Notes, the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, to such Holder by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with such instructions. In the event a Holder would be entitled to receive less than $1,000 principal amount at maturity of any Treasury security, the Agent shall dispose of such Treasury security for cash and deliver such cash to the Holder. In the event a Holder of Equity Units or Stripped Units fails to effect such transfer or delivery, the Notes, the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, underlying such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and any distributions thereon, shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until (i) such Equity Units or Stripped Units are transferred or the Equity Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate is surrendered or such Holder provides satisfactory evidence that such Equity Units Certificate or Stripped Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company; and (ii) the expiration of the time period specified in the abandoned property laws of the relevant State. Section 3.16 No Consent to Assumption. Each Holder of Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, by acceptance thereof, shall be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the Forward Purchase Contract by the Company, any receiver, liquidator or person or entity performing similar functions or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. ARTICLE IV. THE NOTES Section 4.1 Payment of Interest; Rights to Interest Payments Preserved; Notice. (a) A payment on any Note, Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, which is paid on any Payment Date other than a Payment Date with respect to the Stated Amount due on Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Agent from the Collateral Agent (if the Collateral Agent is the 30
registered owner thereof) as provided by the terms of the Pledge Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name the Equity Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Equity Units Certificates) of which such Note or the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, is a part is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. (b) Each Equity Units Certificate evidencing Notes delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Equity Units Certificate shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid which were carried by the Notes and Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such other Equity Units Certificate. (c) In the case of any Equity Units with respect to which Early Settlement of the underlying Forward Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date, Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Forward Purchase Contract is effected on a Merger Early Settlement Date, Cash Settlement is effected on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, or a Collateral Substitution is effected, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, payments on the Note or the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying such Equity Units otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement, Cash Settlement or Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, and such payments shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Equity Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Equity Units Certificates) was registered at the close of business on the Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Equity Units with respect to which Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement of the underlying Forward Purchase Contract is effected, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution has been effected, payments on the related Notes or payments on the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, that would otherwise be payable after the applicable Settlement Date or after such Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such Equity Units; provided, that to the extent that such Holder continues to hold the Separate Notes that formerly comprised a part of such Holder's Equity Units, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the payments on such Separate Notes. Section 4.2 Notice and Voting. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of Equity Units a notice (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to 31
instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes underlying their Equity Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Equity Units on such record date, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of Pledged Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of an Equity Unit, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Note underlying such Equity Units. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Equity Units to timely instruct the Agent in order to enable the Agent to vote such Pledged Notes. Section 4.3 Tax Event Redemption. Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to the earlier of a successful remarketing of the Notes or the Stock Purchase Date, the Company may elect to instruct in writing the Collateral Agent to apply, and upon such written instruction, the Collateral Agent shall apply, out of the aggregate Redemption Price for the Notes that are components of Equity Units, an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount for the Notes that are components of Equity Units to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Equity Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such aggregate Redemption Price to the Agent for payment to the Holders of such Equity Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Notes, and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of an Equity Units to purchase the Common Stock under the Forward Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Equity Units. Following the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to the earlier of a successful remarketing of the Notes or the Stock Purchase Date, the Holders of Equity Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Equity Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V and VI of the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Note shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Equity Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Treasury Portfolio for Notes as collateral. The Company shall cause notice of any Tax Event Redemption to be mailed, at least 30 calendar days but not more than 60 calendar days before such Tax Event Redemption Date, to each Holder of Equity Units including Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption after the earlier of a successful remarketing of the Notes or the Stock Purchase Date, the Redemption Price will be payable in cash to the holders of the Notes. ARTICLE V. THE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS; THE REMARKETING Section 5.1 Purchase of Shares of Common Stock. 32
(a) Each Forward Purchase Contract shall, unless an Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with Section 5.9, or a Merger Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with Section 5.10, obligate the Holder of the related Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $50 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Units of which such Forward Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to, (i) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than or equal to $49.08 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.0187 shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract, (ii) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price, but is greater than $40.90, the number of shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract equal to $50 divided by the Applicable Market Value, and (iii) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or less than $40.90, 1.2225 shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6 and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share. As provided in Section 5.12, no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Forward Purchase Contracts. Promptly after the calculation of the Settlement Rate and the Applicable Market Value, the Company shall give the Agent notice thereof. All calculations and determinations of the Settlement Rate and the Applicable Market Value shall be made by the Company or its agents based on their good faith calculations, and the Agent shall have no responsibility with respect thereto. (b) The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not 33
suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. (c) Each Holder of Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, by its acceptance thereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the related Forward Purchase Contract on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder), agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Forward Purchase Contracts, and consents to the provisions hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to and agrees to be bound by the Pledge of the Notes, the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; provided that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, under the Forward Purchase Contract may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. Each Holder of Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.4 and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect of the Notes, the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or the Treasury Securities, to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Common Stock under the Forward Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Forward Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payment. (d) Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee) under the terms of this Agreement, the Forward Purchase Contracts underlying such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement, and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Forward Purchase Contracts underlying the Certificates so transferred and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. Section 5.2 Contract Adjustment Payments. (a) Contract Adjustment Payments shall accrue on each Forward Purchase Contract constituting a part of an Equity Unit or Stripped Unit at 3.50% per year of the Stated Amount of such Equity Unit or Stripped Unit, from June 11, 2002 through and including the Stock Purchase Date, provided that no Contract Adjustment Payment shall accrue after an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement. Subject to Section 5.3 herein, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Forward Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date in such coin or currency of 34
the United States as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payments. The Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the office in New York, New York, maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to the account designated to the Agent by a prior written notice by such Person delivered at least five Business Days prior to the applicable Payment Date. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), if any, shall cease. (c) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the re-establishment of an Equity Unit) any other Certificate shall carry the rights to Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued and unpaid, and to accrue Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, which were carried by the Forward Purchase Contracts underlying such other Certificates. (d) Subject to Sections 5.9 and 5.10, in the case of any Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Forward Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date or a Merger Early Settlement Date, respectively, or in respect of which Cash Settlement of the underlying Forward Purchase Contract is effected on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution or an establishment or re-establishment of an Equity Units pursuant to Section 3.14 is effected, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Adjustment Payments on the Forward Purchase Contract underlying such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Cash Settlement, Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement, Collateral Substitution or establishment or re-establishment of Equity Units, and such Contract Adjustment Payments shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Equity Units or Stripped Units (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Equity Units or Stripped Units with respect to which Cash Settlement, Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Forward Purchase Contract is effected on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, an Early Settlement Date or Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution or an establishment or re-establishment of an Equity Unit has been effected, Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement Date, or Merger Early Settlement Date, Collateral Substitution or such establishment or re-establishment with respect to such Forward Purchase Contract shall not be payable. Section 5.3 Deferral of Contract Adjustment Payments. 35
(a) The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer each such deferred Contract Adjustment Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Equity Units and Stripped Units, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 5.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments accrued thereon, being referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section 5.3. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Stock Purchase Date and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Forward Purchase Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Holder's right to receive Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, will terminate. If Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments are deferred until the Stock Purchase Date, all payments in respect thereof shall be made in cash on the Stock Purchase Date. (b) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Forward Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. (c) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Common Stock other than: (i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of Common Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers or directors or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its right to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; 36
(iii) the purchase of fractional interests of the Common Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Common Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Common Stock (or rights to acquire Common Stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of Common Stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of the Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Common Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future. Section 5.4 Payment of Purchase Price; Remarketing. (a) Unless a Tax Event Redemption, successful remarketing, Termination Event, Merger Early Settlement or Early Settlement has occurred, each Holder of an Equity Unit may pay in cash ("Cash Settlement") the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to a Forward Purchase Contract if such Holder notifies the Agent by use of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto of its intention to make a Cash Settlement. Such notice shall be made on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. The Agent shall promptly notify the Collateral Agent of the receipt of such a notice from a Holder intending to make a Cash Settlement. (i) A Holder of an Equity Unit who has so notified the Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement is required to pay the Purchase Price to the Collateral Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer, in each case payable to or upon the order of the Company. Any cash received by the Collateral Agent will be paid to the Company on the Stock Purchase Date in settlement of the Forward Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. (ii) If a Holder of an Equity Unit fails to notify the Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with this paragraph (a), the Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Notes pursuant to the remarketing as described in paragraph 5.4(b) below. If a Holder of an Equity Unit does notify the Agent as provided in this paragraph (a) of its intention to pay the Purchase Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph (a)(i) above, the Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Notes pursuant to the remarketing as described in paragraph 5.4 (b) below. (b) The Company has engaged the Remarketing Agent to sell the Notes of (A) Holders of Equity Units, other than Holders that have elected not to participate in the 37
remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (g) below, and (B) holders of Separate Notes that have elected to participate in the remarketing pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement. On the seventh Business Day prior to the Remarketing Date, the Agent shall give Holders of Equity Units and holders of Separate Notes notice of the remarketing (the form of which notice to be provided by the Company) in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in The City of New York, which is expected to be The Wall Street Journal, including the specific U.S. Treasury security or securities (including the CUSIP number and/or the principal terms of such Treasury security or securities) described in subsection (g) below, that must be delivered by Holders of Equity Units that elect not to participate in the remarketing pursuant to subsection (g) below, no later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fourth Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any Subsequent Remarketing Period, as applicable. The Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as applicable, the Remarketing Agent and the Collateral Agent of the aggregate number of Notes of Equity Units Holders to be remarketed. On the third Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as applicable, no later than by 10:00 a.m. New York City time, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Custodial Agent will notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate number of Separate Notes to be remarketed. On the third Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as applicable, the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver for remarketing to the Remarketing Agent all Notes to be remarketed. (c) Upon receipt of such notice from the Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Remarketing Date, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) establish a rate of interest that, in the opinion of the Remarketing Agent, will, when applied to the outstanding Notes, enable the then current aggregate market value of the Notes to have a value equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value as of the Remarketing Date or as of any Subsequent Remarketing Date, as the case may be (the "Reset Rate") and (ii) sell such Notes on such date at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value. (d) If the remarketing occurs prior to the fourth Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent will use the proceeds from a successful remarketing to purchase the appropriate U.S. Treasury securities (the "Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration") with the CUSIP numbers, if any, selected by the Remarketing Agent, described in clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of Remarketing Value related to the Notes of Holders of Equity Units or that were remarketed. On or prior to the third Business Day following the Remarketing Date or any Subsequent Remarketing Date the Remarketing Agent shall deliver such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration to the Agent, which shall thereupon deliver such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration to the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will thereupon apply such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, to secure such Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts. If the remarketing 38
occurs on or after the fourth Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the proceeds of the remarketing will not be used to purchase the Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration, but such proceeds will be paid to the Agent in direct settlement of the obligations of the Holders under the related Forward Purchase Contracts to purchase Common Stock of the Company. The Remarketing Agent will deduct as a remarketing fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the total proceeds from the remarketing (the "Remarketing Fee"). The Remarketing Agent will remit (1) the remaining portion of the proceeds from the remarketing attributable to the Separate Notes to the Custodial Agent for the benefit of the holders of Separate Notes that were remarketed and (2) the remaining portion of the proceeds, less those proceeds used to purchase the Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration or to pay the Company in direct settlement of the Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts, to the Agent for payment to the Holders of the Equity Units that were remarketed, all determined on a pro rata basis, in each case, on or prior to the third Business Day following such Remarketing Date or Subsequent Remarketing Date. Holders whose Notes are so remarketed will not otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. (e) (i) If, in spite of using its commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value, the Remarketing Agent will again attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the two immediately following Business Days. If the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on either of those days, it will attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the three Business Days immediately preceding June 16, 2005. If the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on any of those days, it will attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the three Business Days immediately preceding July 16, 2005. If the Remarketing Agent cannot establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value either on any of the two Business Days immediately following the Remarketing Date or on any of the three Business Days immediately preceding June 16, 2005 or on any of the three Business Days immediately preceding July 16, 2005, the remarketing in each period will be deemed to have failed (each, a "Failed Remarketing"). If the Remarketing Agent cannot establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on any of the three Business Days immediately preceding July 16, 2005, the Remarketing Agent will further attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the three Business Days immediately preceding August 12, 2005. If, in spite of using its commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent fails to remarket the Notes 39
underlying the Equity Units at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, a "Last Failed Remarketing" will be deemed to have occurred. (ii) Within three Business Days following the end of the Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return any Notes delivered to it to the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, as applicable, together with written notice from the Remarketing Agent of such Last Failed Remarketing. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, may exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to such Notes, including those actions specified in Section 5.4(f) below, and the Holders of Equity Units, by their acceptance of the Equity Units shall be deemed to have agreed to such exercise by the Collateral Agent in such case; provided, that if upon the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent delivers any Notes to the Company in full satisfaction of the Holder's obligation under the related Forward Purchase Contracts, any accumulated and unpaid interest on such Notes will become payable by the Company to the Agent for payment to the Holder of the Equity Units to which such Notes relate. Such payment will be made by the Company on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Agent. The Company will publish notice by means of Bloomberg and Reuters newswires of any Remarketing Period during which no successful remarketing occurred, such notice to be published not later than the fourth Business Day following the end of such Remarketing Period. The Company will also cause a notice of the Last Failed Remarketing to be published on the fourth Business Day following the date of the Last Failed Remarketing in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in The City of New York, which is expected to be The Wall Street Journal. (f) With respect to any Notes which constitute part of Equity Units which are subject to the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and Section 5.4 (j) below, may, among other things, permit the Company to cause the Notes to be sold or to retain and cancel such Notes, in either case, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts and the Holders of the Equity Units, by their acceptance of the Equity Units shall be deemed to have agreed to such action by the Collateral Agent. (g) A Holder of Equity Units may elect not to participate in the remarketing and retain the Notes underlying such Equity Units by notifying the Agent of such election and delivering the specific U.S. Treasury security or securities (including the CUSIP number and/or the principal terms of such security or securities) identified by the Agent that constitute the U.S. Treasury securities described in clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of Remarketing Value relating to the retained Notes (as if only such Notes were being remarketed) (the "Opt-out Treasury Consideration") to the Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on the fourth Business Day prior to the Remarketing Date (or, in the case of a Failed Remarketing, not later than 10:00 a.m. on the fourth Business Day immediately prior to the subsequent Remarketing Period). Upon receipt thereof by the Agent, the Agent shall 40
deliver such Opt-out Treasury Consideration to the Collateral Agent, which will, for the benefit of the Company, thereupon apply such Opt-out Treasury Consideration to secure such Holder's obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts. On the first Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date (or, in the case of a Failed Remarketing, the subsequent Remarketing Period), the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver the Pledged Notes of such Holder to the Agent. Within three Business Days following any Remarketing Period, (A) if the remarketing was successful, the Agent shall distribute such Notes to the new holders thereof, and (B) if there was a Failed Remarketing, the Agent will deliver such Notes to the Collateral Agent, which will, for the benefit of the Company, thereupon apply such Notes to secure such Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts and return the Opt-out Treasury Consideration delivered by such Holders to such Holders. A Holder that does not so deliver the Opt-out Treasury Consideration pursuant to this clause (g) shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the remarketing. (h) Upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying the Stripped Units and the Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, underlying the Equity Units, on the Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price applicable to such Units, as payment for the Common Stock issuable upon settlement thereof without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Units. In the event the payments in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio underlying a Unit are in excess of the Purchase Price under the Forward Purchase Contract being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent will distribute such excess to the Agent for the benefit of the Holder of such Units when received. (i) Any distribution to Holders of excess funds and interest described in Section 5.4(c) and (d) above shall be payable at the Office of the Agent in The City of New York maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Holder or the holder of Separate Notes, as applicable, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the relevant Register or by wire transfer to an account specified by the Holder or the holder of Separate Notes, as applicable. (j) The obligations of each Holder to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and except to the extent paid by Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holder, and in no event will any Holder be liable for any deficiency between such proceeds and the Purchase Price. (k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Common Stock in respect of a Forward Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, unless the Company shall have received payment in full for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder by such Holder in the manner herein set forth. 41
(l) In the event of a successful remarketing, the interest rate on all of the outstanding Notes (whether or not included in the remarketing) shall be adjusted to the Reset Rate. Section 5.5 Issuance of Shares of Common Stock. Unless a Termination Event shall have occurred on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date or an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred with respect to all of the outstanding Units, on the Stock Purchase Date, upon its receipt of payment for the shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holders pursuant to the provisions of this Article and subject to Section 5.4, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates or book-entry interests representing the newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates or book-entry interests for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Stock Purchase Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "Forward Purchase Contract Settlement Fund") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Agent on or after the Stock Purchase Date, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or book-entry interest representing that number of whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article V (after taking into account all Equity Units and Stripped Units then held by such Holder) together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.12 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Forward Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Forward Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Forward Purchase Contract is registered, no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of such Certificate or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. Section 5.6 Adjustment of Settlement Rate. (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc. (l) Stock Dividends. In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, as in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date 42
fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (2) Stock Purchase Rights. In case the Company shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock (not being available on an equivalent basis to Holders of the Equity Units and Stripped Units upon settlement of the Forward Purchase Contracts underlying such Equity Units and Stripped Units) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (3) Stock Splits; Reverse Splits. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of 43
Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (4) Debt or Asset Distributions. (i) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in paragraph (2) of this Section, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend, shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in the next paragraph, or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section), the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (4) is applicable, paragraph (2) of this Section shall not be applicable. (ii) In the case of a Spin-Off, the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by multiplying the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate under this paragraph 4(ii) will occur at the earlier of (1) the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off and (2) the date of the securities being offered in the Initial Public Offering of the Spin-Off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-Off. 44
(5) Cash Distributions. In case the Company shall, (i) by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.6(b) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this Section) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (ii) the aggregate amount of any other distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made and (iii) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value as of the date of the expiration of the tender or exchange offer referred to below (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of consideration payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of the distribution described in clause (i) above and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made, exceeds 15% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on such date for determination, the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the combined amount distributed or payable in the transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date for determination and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such date for determination. (6) Tender Offers. In case (i) a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) that combined together with (ii) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), as 45
of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender or exchange offer, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section or this paragraph (6) has been made and (iii) the aggregate amount of any distributions to all holders of the Company's Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) of this Section or this paragraph (6) has been made, exceeds 15% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time, then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time less (y) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above (assuming in the case of clause (i) the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the Expiration Time and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares"). (7) Reclassification. The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.6(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve (i) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this Section), and (ii) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately 46
prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective," as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this Section). (8) "Current Market Price". The "Current Market Price" of the Common Stock means (a) on any day the average of the Sales Prices for the 5 consecutive Trading Days preceding the earlier of the day preceding the day in question and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring computation, (b) in the case of any Spin-Off that is effected simultaneously with an Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-Off, the Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day on which the Initial Public Offering price of the securities being distributed in the Spin-Off is determined, and (c) in the case of any other Spin-Off, the average of the Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the first 10 Trading Days after the effective date of such Spin-Off. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. (9) Calculation of Adjustments. All adjustments to the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; provided, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. If an adjustment is made to the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of this Section 5.6(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in Section 5.1(a) will apply on the Stock Purchase Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of this Section 5.6(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, immediately before such adjustment; provided, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph 47
(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) or (10) of this Section 5.6(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable. (10) Increase of Settlement Rate. The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, in addition to those required by this Section, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons. (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. In the event of (1) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation), (2) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, (3) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition), or (4) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any such event, a "Reorganization Event"), each share of Common Stock covered by each Forward Purchase Contract forming a part of an Equity Unit or Stripped Unit, as the case may be, immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be converted for purposes of the Forward Purchase Contract into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distributions thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Stock Purchase Date) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that (i) is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates, and (ii) failed to exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a 48
Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-electing Share"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares). On the Stock Purchase Date, the Settlement Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on the Stock Purchase Date of such securities, cash or other property. In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.6. Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. Section 5.7 Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events. (a) Whenever the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall: (i) forthwith compute the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, and the Applicable Market Value in accordance with Section 5.6 and prepare and transmit to the Agent an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rate and the Applicable Market Value, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, pursuant to Section 5.6 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide a written notice to the Holders of the Equity Units and Stripped Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, and the Applicable Market Value was determined and setting forth the adjusted Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, and the Applicable Market Value. (b) The Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Equity Units and Stripped Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rate or Early Settlement Rate, as applicable, and the Applicable Market Value, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered with respect to any Forward Purchase Contract; and the 49
Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Forward Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Section 5.8 Termination Event; Notice. The Forward Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Equity Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Notes or the appropriate Treasury Consideration or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, forming a part of such Equity Units, and the Stripped Units shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Treasury Securities forming a part of such Stripped Units, in each case in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 of the Pledge Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the applicable Register. Section 5.9 Early Settlement. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, Forward Purchase Contracts underlying Equity Units or Stripped Units may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("Early Settlement") at any time not later than 10:00 a.m. on the seventh Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Forward Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the related Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, shall deliver such Certificate to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount (the "Early Settlement Amount") equal to (A) the product of (i) the Stated Amount of such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, multiplied by (ii) the number of Forward Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Forward Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Forward Purchase Contracts; provided that no payment shall be required pursuant to clause (B) of this sentence if the Company shall have elected to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments that would otherwise be payable on such Payment Date and further provided that, at that time, if so required by the United States federal securities laws, a registration statement is in effect and a prospectus is available covering the shares of the Common Stock of the Company to be delivered in respect of the Forward Purchase Contracts being settled. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and subject to Section 5.2(d), no 50
payment or adjustment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Forward Purchase Contract on any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Forward Purchase Contract or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Forward Purchase Contracts underlying any Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, such day shall be the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, shall be the next succeeding Business Day. (b) Holders of Equity Units may settle only in units of 20 and integral multiples of 20. If a successful remarketing or a Tax Event Redemption has occurred, Holders of Stripped Units may effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.9 only in integral multiples of 32,000. (c) Upon Early Settlement of any Forward Purchase Contract by the Holder of the related Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, 1.0187 shares of Common Stock for each Equity Unit or Stripped Unit on account of such Forward Purchase Contract (the "Early Settlement Rate"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted. As promptly as practicable after Early Settlement of Forward Purchase Contracts in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, the Company shall issue and shall deliver to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office a certificate or certificates or book entry interest for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12. (d) No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date the Company shall cause (i) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Forward Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, and (ii) the related Pledged Notes or Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of Equity Units, or the related Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of Stripped Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or the Holder's designee. (e) Upon Early Settlement of any Forward Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of shares of Common Stock from the Company and the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from the Collateral Agent, as applicable, the Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, (i) transfer to the Holder the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case 51
may be, forming a part of such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, and (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates or book-entry interest for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12. (f) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Forward Purchase Contracts underlying less than all the Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement the Company shall execute and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder thereof and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, as to which Early Settlement was not effected. Section 5.10 Early Settlement Upon Merger.

On or before the fifth Business Day after the consummation of a Cash Merger, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Agent, shall give all Holders notice of the occurrence of the Cash Merger and of the right of Merger Early Settlement arising as a result thereof. The Company shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Agent and the Collateral Agent. Each such notice shall contain: (i) the date, which shall be not less than 20 nor more than 30 calendar days after the date of such notice, on which the Merger Early Settlement will be effected (the "Merger Early Settlement Date"); (ii) the date, which shall be on or one Business Day prior to the Merger Early Settlement Date, by which the Merger Early Settlement right must be exercised; (iii) the Settlement Rate in effect as a result of such Cash Merger and the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable by the Holder upon settlement of each Forward Purchase Contract pursuant to Section 5.6(b); (iv) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the Purchase Price payable by the Holder to settle the Forward Purchase Contract will be offset against the amount of cash so receivable upon exercise of Merger Early Settlement, as applicable; and (v) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Merger Early Settlement right. 52

(c) On the Merger Early Settlement Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) the net cash, securities and other property to be received by such exercising Holder, equal to the Settlement Rate as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6, in respect of the number of Forward Purchase Contracts for which such Merger Early Settlement right was exercised, and (ii) the related Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, in the case of Equity Units, or Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of Stripped Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee.

No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Stock Purchase Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of any Forward Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one Forward Purchase Contract shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Forward Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Forward Purchase Contracts on the applicable Settlement Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, the Company, through the Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional share in an amount equal to the value of such fractional share times the Applicable Market Value. The Company shall provide the Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.12 in a timely manner. Section 5.13 Tax Treatment. The Company covenants and agrees and each Holder, by purchasing the Equity Units agrees, (i) to treat a Holder's acquisition of the Equity Units as the acquisition of the Note and Forward Purchase Contract constituting the Equity Units, (ii) to treat a Holder's acquisition of the Stripped Units as the acquisition of the Treasury Security and Forward Purchase Contract constituting the Stripped Unit, (iii) to treat each Holder as the owner of the related Notes, Treasury Consideration, Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be and (iv) to allocate the purchase price of the Equity Unit between the Note and Forward Purchase Contract as $50 and $0, respectively.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. Section 6.4 Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy upon a default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such right. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Holders. Section 6.5 Undertaking For Costs. All parties to this Agreement agree, and each Holder of Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, by its acceptance of such Equity Units or Stripped Units, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Agreement, or in any suit against the Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Agent, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable 55

(Form of Reverse of Equity Units Certificate) Each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2002 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Forward Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Forward Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Equity Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Equity Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $50 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement with respect to the Units of which such Forward Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than or equal to $49.08 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.0187 shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $40.90, the number of shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract equal to the Stated Amount of the related Equity Units divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to $40.90, 1.2225 shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Forward Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities A-7
exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. Each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, and may be settled on the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, all in accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Equity Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting a Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, (ii) by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Consideration acquired from the proceeds of a remarketing of the related Pledged Notes underlying the Equity Units represented by this Equity Units Certificate, (iii) if the Holder has elected not to participate in the remarketing, by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Consideration deposited by such Holder in respect of such Forward Purchase Contract, or (iv) if a Tax Event Redemption has occurred prior to the successful remarketing of the Notes, by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio purchased by the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Holder of this Equity Units Certificate. If, as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, upon the occurrence of the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, exercises its rights as a secured creditor with respect to the Pledged Notes related to this Equity Units Certificate, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Pledged Notes will become payable by the Company to the Holder of this Equity Units Certificate in the manner provided for in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Forward Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates or book-entry interest therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes, but only to the extent instructed by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Holders of Equity Units a notice (a) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation, (b) stating that each such Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes constituting a part of such Holder's Equity Units and (c) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Equity Units on such record date, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of Pledged Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of an Equity Unit, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Note evidenced by such Equity Units. A-8
The Equity Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Equity Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Equity Units Certificate will be registered and Equity Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. The Equity Units Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. The Holder of an Equity Units may substitute for the Pledged Notes securing its obligations under the related Forward Purchase Contract Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, the Units for which such Pledged Treasury Securities secure the Holder's obligation under the Forward Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "Stripped Unit." A Holder that elects to substitute a Treasury Security for Pledged Notes thereby creating Stripped Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Forward Purchase Contract underlying an Equity Unit remains in effect, such Equity Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Equity Unit in respect of the Pledged Note and Forward Purchase Contract constituting such Equity Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as an Equity Unit. A Holder of Stripped Units may reestablish Equity Units by delivering to the Collateral Agent Notes in exchange for the release of the Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Forward Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Equity Units Certificate evidencing such Forward Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the office of the Agent in the City of New York or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Equity Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing at least five Business Days prior to the applicable Payment Date. The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 5.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Adjustment Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Stock Purchase Date and no such A-9
deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Forward Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its Common Stock other than (i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of Common Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers or directors or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its rights to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of any series of the Company's Common Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Common Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Common Stock (or rights to acquire Common Stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of Common Stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of any series of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Common Stock); or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future. The Forward Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights and obligations of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, and the rights of the Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Equity Units Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Notes, Pledged Treasury Consideration or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement.

(Reverse of Stripped Units Certificate) Each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2002 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Forward Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Forward Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Stripped Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $50 (the "Purchase Price"), a number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the Settlement Rate, unless, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement with respect to the Stripped Units of which such Forward Purchase Contract is a part. The "Settlement Rate" is equal to (a) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than or equal to $49.08 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 1.0187 shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract, (b) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price but is greater than $40.90, the number of shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract equal to the Stated Amount of the related Stripped Units divided by the Applicable Market Value and (c) if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal $40.90, 1.2225 shares of Common Stock per Forward Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Forward Purchase Contracts, as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, as reported by The NASDAQ Stock Market, or, if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or, if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities B-5
exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. Each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby may be settled prior to the Stock Purchase Date through Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, and may be settled on the Stock Purchase Date through Cash Settlement, all in accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Stripped Units Certificate shall pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Forward Purchase Contract evidenced hereby (i) by effecting an Early Settlement, Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement or (ii) by application of payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Securities underlying the Stripped Units represented by this Stripped Units Certificate. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Forward Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates or book-entry interest therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. The Stripped Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Stripped Units and any integral multiple thereof.

No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. The Holder of a Stripped Unit may substitute for the Pledged Treasury Securities securing its obligations under the related Forward Purchase Contract Notes in accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such substitution, the Units for which such Pledged Notes secure the Holder's obligation under the Forward Purchase Contract shall be referred to as an "Equity Unit." A Holder that elects to substitute Notes for Pledged Treasury Securities, thereby reestablishing Equity Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Forward Purchase Contract underlying a Stripped Unit remains in effect, such Stripped Units shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Stripped Units in respect of the Pledged Treasury Security and the Forward Purchase Contract constituting such Stripped Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Stripped Unit.

Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be payable at the Office of the Agent in the City of New York or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at B-6
such address as it appears on the Stripped Units Register or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person in writing at least five Business Days prior to the applicable Payment Date. The Company shall have the right, at any time prior to the Stock Purchase Date, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its election to defer Contract Adjustment Payments as provided in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. Any Contract Adjustment Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, bear additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon at the rate of 5.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments").

In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Forward Purchase Contracts until a Payment Date prior to the Stock Purchase Date, then all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until the Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its Common Stock other than (i) purchases, redemptions or acquisitions of shares of Common Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers or directors or a stock purchase or dividend reinvestment plan, or the satisfaction by the Company of its obligations pursuant to any contract or security outstanding on the date the Company exercises its rights to defer the Contract Adjustment Payments; (ii) as a result of a reclassification of the Company's Capital Stock or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for another class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of any series of the Company's Common Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Common Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in any series of the Company's Common Stock (or rights to acquire Common Stock) or repurchases, acquisitions or redemptions of Common Stock in connection with the issuance or exchange of any series of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of the Company's Common Stock; or (v) redemptions, exchanges or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan or the declaration or payment thereunder of a dividend or distribution of or with respect to rights in the future.

and the obligation of the Company to pay Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Stock Purchase Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred.

Any such interest not punctually paid or duly provided for with respect to any Interest Payment Date falling after the Stock Purchase Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holders on such regular record date, and may be paid to the person or persons in whose name the Senior Notes are registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered holders of the Senior Notes not less than ten (10) days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in Section 2.03 of the Original Indenture.

(d) Payment of the principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be made at an Office or Agency of the Company or at the Office of the Agent in The City of New York in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment 5
is legal tender for payment of public and private debts, with any such payment that is due on the Stated Maturity of any Senior Notes being made upon surrender of such Senior Notes to the Office or Agency of the Company or at the Office of the Agent in The City of New York. Payments of interest will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled hereto. SECTION 1.4. Denominations. The Senior Notes shall be issued in denominations of $50 and integral multiples of $50. SECTION 1.5. Global Securities. (a) The Senior Notes that, in accordance with the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, are no longer part of the Equity Units will be issued initially in the form of one or more global securities (the "Global Securities") registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Except under the limited circumstances described below or in Section 1.3 above, Senior Notes represented by such Global Securities will not be exchangeable for, and will not otherwise be issuable as, Senior Notes in definitive form. The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or to a successor Depository or its nominee. (b) Owners of beneficial interests in such a Global Security will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and no Global Security representing a Senior Note shall be exchangeable, except for another Global Security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of DTC or its nominee or to a successor Depository or its nominee or except as described below. The rights of owners of beneficial interests in such a Global Security shall be exercised only through DTC. (c) A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of persons other than DTC or its nominee only if (i) DTC notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a Depository for such Global Security and no successor Depository shall have been appointed by the Company within 90 days of receipt by the Company of such notification, or if at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 at a time when DTC is required to be so registered to act as such Depository and no successor Depository shall have been appointed by the Company within 90 days after it becomes aware of such cessation, or (ii) the Company in its sole discretion determines that it no longer has any senior debt securities represented by global securities or that it will permit a Global Security to be exchangeable or an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding 6
sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as DTC shall direct. SECTION 1.6. Remarketing. (a) The Pledged Notes comprising part of Equity Units and the Separate Notes of holders of Separate Notes that have elected to participate in the Remarketing shall be remarketed by the Remarketing Agent on the Remarketing Date. A Holder of Equity Units may elect not to participate in a Remarketing and retain the Senior Notes underlying such Equity Units by notifying the Forward Purchase Contract Agent of such election and delivering the Opt-out Treasury Consideration to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. on the fourth Business Day prior to the Remarketing Date, as applicable (or, in the case of a Failed Remarketing, not later than 10:00 a.m. on the fourth Business Day immediately prior to the subsequent Remarketing Period). Upon receipt thereof by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall deliver such Opt-out Treasury Consideration to the Collateral Agent, which will, for the benefit of the Company, thereupon apply such Opt-out Treasury Consideration to secure such Holder's obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts. On the first Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date (or, in the case of a Failed Remarketing, the subsequent Remarketing Period), the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver the Pledged Notes to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent. Within three Business Days following any Remarketing Period (A) if the Remarketing was successful, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall distribute such Notes to the new Holders thereof and (B) if there was a Failed Remarketing, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent will deliver such Notes to the Collateral Agent, which will, for the benefit of the Company, thereupon apply such Notes that are a component of Equity Units to secure such Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts, return any Opt-out Treasury Consideration delivered by such Holders to such Holders and return the Separate Notes to the holders thereof. A Holder that does not so deliver the Opt-out Treasury Consideration or has not settled the related Purchase Contract through a Cash Settlement or an Early Settlement pursuant to Sections 5.4 and 5.9 of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement shall be deemed to have elected to participate in the Remarketing. (b) On the seventh Business Day prior to the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, the Company shall give Holders of Equity Units and Holders of Separate Notes notice of the Remarketing in an Authorized Newspaper, including the specific U.S. Treasury security or securities (including the CUSIP number and/or the principal terms of such Treasury security or securities) that must be delivered by Holders of Equity Units that elect not to participate in the Remarketing pursuant to Section 5.4(g) of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, no later than 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the seventh Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date. Not later than seven nor more than 15 calendar days prior to any Remarketing Period, the Company shall request DTC (or any successor Clearing Agency) to notify, directly or indirectly, each Beneficial Owner or Clearing Agency Participant holding Equity Units or Stripped Units and each Beneficial Owner of a Separate Note of 7
the Remarketing and of the procedures that must be followed in connection with the Remarketing. (c) The Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Date preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as applicable, the Remarketing Agent and the Collateral Agent of the aggregate number of Senior Notes of Equity Units Holders to be remarketed. On the third Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as applicable, no later than by 10:00 a.m. New York City time, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Custodial Agent will notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate number of Separate Notes to be remarketed. On the third Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as applicable, the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will deliver for Remarketing to the Remarketing Agent all Notes to be remarketed. Upon receipt of such notice from the Forward Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Remarketing Date, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to establish a Reset Rate pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Reset Rate and remarket such Senior Notes pursuant to the Remarketing procedures in the Remarketing Agreement. (d) The right of each Holder of Senior Notes to have its Senior Notes tendered for purchase will be limited to the extent that (i) the Remarketing Agent conducts a Remarketing pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) the Remarketing Agent is able to find a purchaser or purchasers for the tendered Senior Notes and (iii) such purchaser or purchasers deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent. (e) Upon receipt of the notice provided above in paragraph (c) from the Forward Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Remarketing Date, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) establish a rate of interest that, in the opinion of the Remarketing Agent, will, when applied to the outstanding Notes, enable the then current aggregate market value of the Notes to have a value equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value as of the Remarketing Date or as of any Subsequent Remarketing Date, as the case may be (the "Reset Rate") and (ii) sell such Notes on such date at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value. (f) If, in spite of using its commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value, the Remarketing Agent will again attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the two immediately following Business Days. If the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the 8
Remarketing Value on any of those days, it will attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the three Business Days immediately preceding June 16, 2005. If the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on any of those days, it will attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the three Business Days immediately preceding July 16, 2005. If the Remarketing Agent cannot establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value either on any of the two Business Days immediately following the Remarketing Date or on any of the three Business Days immediately preceding June 16, 2005 or on any of the three Business Days immediately preceding July 16, 2005, the remarketing in each period will be deemed to have failed (each, a "Failed Remarketing"). If the Remarketing Agent cannot establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on any of the three Business Days immediately preceding July 16, 2005, the Remarketing Agent will further attempt to establish the Reset Rate and remarket the Notes included in the remarketing at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value on each of the three Business Days immediately preceding August 12, 2005. If, in spite of using its commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent fails to remarket the Notes underlying the Equity Units at a price equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, a "Last Failed Remarketing" will be deemed to have occurred. (g) If a successful Remarketing shall have occurred prior to the fourth Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent will, in accordance with the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement: (i) deduct and retain for itself the Remarketing Fee; (ii) use the proceeds from such successful Remarketing to purchase the Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration with the CUSIP numbers, if any, selected by the Remarketing Agent, described in clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of Remarketing Value related to the Senior Notes of Holders of Equity Units that were remarketed; (iii) if any Separate Notes were remarketed, remit to the Collateral Agent for payment to the Holders of such Separate Notes sold in the Remarketing the remaining proceeds from such successful Remarketing attributable to the Separate Notes; and 9
(iv) if there remain any proceeds from such successful Remarketing, after the application of such proceeds as set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this sentence, then remit such remaining proceeds to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the Equity Units that were remarketed, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement. (h) In the case of a successful Remarketing occurring prior to the fourth Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, on or prior to the third Business Day following the Remarketing Date or any Subsequent Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall deliver such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, which shall thereupon deliver such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration to the Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will thereupon apply such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, to secure such Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts. (i) If a successful Remarketing shall have occurred on or after the fourth Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent will, in accordance with the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement: (i) deduct and retain for itself the Remarketing Fee; (ii) pay the proceeds from such successful Remarketing to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, which shall thereupon deliver such proceeds to the Collateral Agent which, for the benefit of the Company, will thereupon apply such proceeds, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement in direct settlement of the Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts; (iii) if any Separate Notes were remarketed, remit to the Collateral Agent for payment to the Holders of such Separate Notes sold in the Remarketing the remaining proceeds from such successful Remarketing attributable to the Separate Notes; and (iv) if there remain any proceeds from such successful Remarketing, after the application of such proceeds as set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this sentence, then remit such remaining proceeds to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the Equity Units that were remarketed, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement. (j) If a successful Remarketing occurs, by approximately 4:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the Remarketing Date, the Remarketing Agent shall advise, by telephone (promptly confirmed in writing in the case of clause (i)): (i) the Company, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary, DTC and the Trustee of the Reset Rate 10
determined in the Remarketing; (ii) each purchaser (or the Depository Participant thereof) of Senior Notes in the Remarketing of the Reset Rate and the number of Senior Notes such purchaser is to purchase; and (iii) each purchaser to give instructions to its Depository Participant to pay the purchase price on the date of settlement for such Remarketing in same day funds against delivery of the remarketed Senior Notes purchased through the facilities of DTC. (k) Any distribution to Holders of excess funds and interest described in this Section 1.6 shall be payable at the Office of the Agent in The City of New York maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Holder or the holder of Separate Notes, as applicable, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the relevant Register or by wire transfer to an account specified by the Holder or the holder of Separate Notes, as applicable. (l) If a Failed Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent and the Company, as applicable, shall take the following actions: (i) the Remarketing Agent shall notify by telephone the Company, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Trustee, that a Failed Remarketing has occurred, whereupon the Company shall notify the Clearing Agency, by telephone, that a Failed Remarketing has occurred; (ii) with respect to any Remarketing Period during which no successful Remarketing occurred, the Company shall publish notice by means of Bloomberg and Reuters newswires, such notice to be published no later than the fourth Business Day following the end of such Remarketing Period; (iii) the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate in accordance with clause (ii) of the Reset Rate definition; and (iv) the Remarketing Agent shall remit, within three Business Days following the end of a Remarketing Period which constituted a Failed Remarketing, the Pledged Notes that were to be remarketed to the Collateral Agent and the Separate Notes that were to be remarketed to the Custodial Agent. (m) If upon a Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent delivers any Senior Notes to the Company in full satisfaction of the Holder's obligation under the related Forward Purchase Contracts, any accumulated and unpaid interest on such Notes will become payable by the Company to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holder of the Equity Units to which such Notes relate. Such payment will be made by the Company on or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Stock Purchase Date in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Forward 11
Purchase Contract Agent. Upon the occurrence of a Last Failed Remarketing, the Company will retain and dispose of the Pledged Notes of all Holders in satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the related Forward Purchase Contracts. The Company will publish notice by means of Bloomberg and Reuters newswires of any Remarketing Period during which no successful Remarketing occurred, such notice to be published not later than the fourth Business Day following the end of such Remarketing Period. The Company will cause a notice of the Last Failed Remarketing to be published on the fourth Business Day following the date of the Last Failed Remarketing in an Authorized Newspaper. (n) In the event of a Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate that shall apply to the Senior Notes held by the Holders of Equity Units that elected not to participate in the remarketing and Holders of Separate Notes according to the following method, provided that in no event shall the Reset Rate exceed the maximum rate permitted by state usury laws and other applicable laws. After the Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will take the average of the interest rates quoted to it by three nationally recognized investment banks selected by the Company, which are underwriters or dealers in debt securities similar to the Senior Notes, that in their judgment reflects an accurate market rate of interest applicable to the Senior Notes at that time. Following receipt of these quotes, the Remarketing Agent will have the right, in its sole judgment, to either recalculate the average based on only two of the quoted interest rates if one of the three quotes, in the Remarketing Agent's sole discretion, did not reflect market conditions or, alternatively, determine a consensus among the investment banks rather than a strict mathematical average by taking into account all relevant qualitative and quantitative factors. These factors may include, but shall not limited to, maturity of the Senior Notes, the credit rating and credit risk of the Company and companies of similar industries, the then yield to maturity of the Senior Notes and the state of the markets for primary and secondary sales of similar debt securities.

On the third Business Day immediately prior to the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the Collateral Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the number of such Separate Notes to be remarketed. The Collateral Agent will hold such Separate Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account. A holder of Separate Notes electing to have its Separate Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw such election by written notice to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D to the Pledge Agreement, on or prior to the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date or the first day of a subsequent Remarketing Period, upon which notice the Collateral Agent will return such Separate Notes to such holder. (b) On the third Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, the Collateral Agent at the written direction of the Remarketing Agent will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for Remarketing all Separate Notes delivered to the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 4.5(d) of the Pledge Agreement and not withdrawn pursuant to the terms thereof prior to such date. If the holder of the Separate Notes delivers only such notice but not the Separate Notes subject to such notice, then none of such holder's Separate Notes shall be included in the Remarketing. Once the holder of Separate Notes elects to participate in 13
the Remarketing, such Separate Notes will be remarketed in the Remarketing, unless such notice is properly withdrawn.

(ii) Significant Subsidiary means, at any particular time, any direct subsidiary of the Company whose consolidated gross assets or consolidated gross revenues (having regard to the Company's direct beneficial interest in the shares, or the like, of that subsidiary) represent at least 25% of the Company's consolidated gross assets or consolidated gross revenues appearing in the most recent audited financial statements of the Company as of the date of determination. (b) The provisions of Article Ten of the Original Indenture shall be applicable to the Senior Notes. SECTION 1.11. Defeasance.

(a) If a Tax Event shall occur, the Company may, at its option, redeem the 14
Senior Notes in whole (but not in part) at any time at a price per Senior Note equal to the Redemption Price. Installments of interest on the Senior Notes that are due and payable on or prior to the date of redemption (the "Tax Event Redemption Date") will be payable to the Holders of the Senior Notes registered as such on the Record Date next preceding such Tax Event Redemption Date. If, following the settlement of the Forward Purchase Contracts and following the occurrence of a Tax Event, the Company, at its option, redeems the Senior Notes, the proceeds of the redemption will be payable in cash to the Holders of the Senior Notes. (b) If the Company exercises its option to redeem the Senior Notes following the occurrence of a Tax Event prior to the Remarketing Date, or if there has not been a successful Remarketing prior to the Stock Purchase Date, the Company shall in the notice to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture specify the Redemption Price. Upon the specification of the Redemption Price by the Company, the Company shall appoint the Collateral Agent to acquire the Treasury Portfolio in consultation with the Company and in accordance with the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall then apply, out of the aggregate Redemption Price for the Senior Notes that are components of Equity Units, an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount for the Senior Notes that are components of Equity Units to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Equity Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion, if any, of such aggregate Redemption Price to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Equity Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Notes, and will be pledged to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of an Equity Unit to purchase the Common Stock under the Forward Purchase Contract constituting a part of such Equity Units. Payment of the Redemption Price to Holders of Separate Notes shall be made in cash on the Tax Event Redemption Date. (c) If a Tax Event Redemption occurs after the earlier of a successful Remarketing or the Stock Purchase Date, payment of the Redemption Price to each Holder of Senior Notes shall be made by the Trustee (subject to its receipt of funds), no later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Tax Event Redemption Date, by check or wire transfer in immediately available funds (provided the necessary wire instructions have been provided to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the Tax Event Redemption Date) at such place and to such account as may be designated by each such Holder of Senior Notes, including the Collateral Agent. If the Trustee holds immediately available funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Senior Notes, then, on such Tax Event Redemption Date, such Senior Notes will cease to be Outstanding. (d) The Trustee shall have no duty or liability to determine or verify the Redemption Price. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Tax Event Redemption Date to each registered Holder of the Senior Notes to be repaid at its registered address. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Tax Event Redemption Date interest shall cease to accrue on the Senior Notes, whether or not such Senior Notes have been received by the Company, and all other rights of the Holders in respect of the Senior Notes shall terminate and lapse (other than the right to receive the Redemption Price 15
upon delivery of such Senior Notes but without interest on such Redemption Price). SECTION 1.13. Tax Treatment.

[Reverse of Note] American Electric Power Company, Inc. 5.75% Senior Notes Due August 16, 2007 This Senior Note is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of May 1, 2001 (the "Original Indenture"), as previously supplemented and as to be supplemented by a third supplemental indenture, dated as of June 11, 2002 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture" and the Original Indenture, as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, a New York banking corporation, as trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Senior Note is one of a series designated as 5.75% Senior Notes Due August 16, 2007 of the Company (hereinafter called the "Senior Notes"), issued under the Original Indenture, which is limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000. Neither the Original Indenture nor the Senior Notes limit or otherwise restrict the amount of indebtedness which may be incurred or other securities which may be issued by the Company. The Senior Notes issued under the Indenture are direct, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on August 16, 2007. The Senior Notes rank on parity with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Senior Notes will bear interest as set forth on the face hereof and in the Third Supplemental Indenture. The Reset Rate will be the interest rate per annum that is determined by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement as follows: (i) in connection with a successful Remarketing, the rate of interest that will, when applied to the Outstanding Notes, enable the then current aggregate market value of the Notes to have a value equal to approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value as of the Remarketing Date or as of any Subsequent Remarketing Date, as the case may be, or (ii) upon the occurrence of a Failed Remarketing the rate of interest applicable to the Senior Notes initially until (A) the Senior Notes are successfully remarketed pursuant to the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement or (B) if the Last Failed Remarketing shall have occurred, in accordance with the method as described below. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate, if any, permitted by applicable law. In the event of a Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall determine the Reset Rate that shall apply to the Senior Notes held by the Holders of Equity Units that elected not to participate in the remarketing and Holders of Separate Notes according to the following method. After the Last Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will take the average of the interest rates quoted to it by three nationally recognized investment banks selected A-5
by the Company, which are underwriters or dealers in debt securities similar to the Senior Notes, that in their judgment reflects an accurate market rate of interest applicable to the Senior Notes at that time. Following receipt of these quotes, the Remarketing Agent will have the right, in its sole judgment, to either recalculate the average based on only two of the quoted interest rates if one of the three quotes, in the Remarketing Agent's sole discretion, did not reflect market conditions or, alternatively, determine a consensus among the investment banks rather than a strict mathematical average by taking into account all relevant qualitative and quantitative factors. These factors may include, but shall not limited to, maturity of the Senior Notes, the credit rating and credit risk of the Company and companies of similar industries, the then yield to maturity of the Senior Notes and the state of the markets for primary and secondary sales of similar debt securities. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity except pursuant to a Tax Event in accordance with the Third Supplemental Indenture. If a Tax Event shall occur, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Senior Notes in whole (but not in part) at any time at a price per Senior Note equal to the Redemption Price. Installments of interest on the Senior Notes that are due and payable on or prior to the date of redemption will be payable to the Holders of the Senior Notes registered as such at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Tax Event Redemption Date. If, following the settlement of the Forward Purchase Contracts and following the occurrence of a Tax Event, the Company, at its option, redeems the Senior Notes, the proceeds of the redemption will be payable in cash to the Holders of the Senior Notes. The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in the Senior Notes, each beneficial holder of Senior Notes will be deemed to have agreed (1) for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes to treat the acquisition of an Equity Unit as the acquisition of the Senior Note and the Forward Purchase Contract constituting the Equity Unit, (2) to treat the Senior Notes as indebtedness that is subject to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1275-4 (the "Contingent Payment Regulations") for United States federal income tax purposes and (3) to be bound by the Company's determination of the "comparable yield" and "projected payment schedule," within the meaning of the Contingent Payment Regulations, with respect to the Senior Notes for United States federal income tax purposes. A Holder of Senior Notes may obtain the amount of original issue discount, issue date, yield to maturity, comparable yield and projected payment schedule by submitting a written request for it to the Company at the following address: American Electric Power, Investor Relations, One Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215. The Senior Notes are not entitled to any sinking fund. The Senior Notes that are a component of Equity Units or that so elect under Section 1.7 of the Indenture will be subject to Remarketing and, in the case of a Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party of the Pledged Notes with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and Section 5.4 of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, may, among other things, permit the Company to cause the Senior Notes to be sold or to retain and cancel such Senior Notes, in either case, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts. A-6
If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Senior Indenture provides that in certain circumstances such declaration and its consequences may be waived by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then Outstanding. However, any such consent or waiver by the Holder shall not affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series affected by such supplemental indenture or indentures at the time outstanding voting as one class, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of a Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to the Indenture, without the consent of the holder of each Senior Note then outstanding and affected; (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Senior Notes, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, or reduce the percentage of Senior Notes, the holders of which are required to waive any default and its consequences, without the consent of the holder of each Senior Note then outstanding and affected thereby; or (iii) modify any provision of Section 6.01(c) of the Indenture (except to increase the percentage of principal amount of securities required to rescind and annul any declaration of amounts due and payable under the Senior Notes), without the consent of the holder of each Senior Note then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the Holders of the Senior Notes of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. Restrictive Covenants Limitation upon Liens of Certain Subsidiaries For so long as any Senior Notes of this series remain outstanding, the Company will not create or incur or allow any of its subsidiaries to create or incur any pledge or security interest on any of the capital stock of a Public Utility Subsidiary held by the Company or one of its subsidiaries or a Significant Subsidiary. A-7

(b) Prior to or concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the initial Holders of the Equity Units, shall cause the Notes comprising a part of the Equity Units to be Transferred to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company. (c) The pledge provided in this Section 2.1 is herein referred to as the "Pledge" and the Notes (or the Notes that are delivered pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof), Treasury Consideration, Treasury Securities or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio subject to the Pledge, excluding any Notes or Treasury Securities released from the Pledge as provided in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 hereof, respectively, are herein referred to as "Pledged Notes," "Pledged Treasury Consideration," "Pledged Treasury Securities" or "Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio," respectively.

The grant of such power-of-attorney shall not be deemed to require of the Collateral Agent any specific duties or obligations not otherwise assumed by the Collateral Agent hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary be responsible for the preparation or filing of any financing or continuation statements in the appropriate jurisdictions or responsible for maintenance or perfection of any security interest hereunder. (d) The Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall file with the Internal Revenue Service and deliver to the Holders Forms 1099 (or successor or comparable forms), to the extent required by law, with respect to payments by the Holders. Neither the Securities Intermediary nor the Collateral Agent shall have any tax reporting duties hereunder. 7

ARTICLE IV SUBSTITUTION, RELEASE, REPLEDGE AND SETTLEMENT OF NOTES SECTION 4.1 Collateral Substitution and the Creation of Stripped Units. Unless a successful remarketing or a Tax Event Redemption has occurred, at any time on or prior to the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, a Holder of Equity Units shall have the right to substitute Treasury Securities for the Pledged Notes securing such Holder's obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts comprising a part of such Equity Units, in integral multiples of 20 Equity Units by (a) Transferring to the Collateral Agent Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of such Equity Units and (b) delivering such Equity Units to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, accompanied by a 9

SECTION 4.5 Remarketing; Application of Proceeds; Settlement. (a) Pursuant to the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall notify, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as the case may be, the Remarketing Agent and the Collateral Agent of the aggregate number of Notes comprising part of Equity Units to be remarketed. The Collateral Agent shall, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, as the case may be, without any instruction from Holders of Equity Units, Transfer the Pledged Notes to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing. Upon completion of a successful remarketing which occurs prior to the fourth Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, after deducting as the remarketing fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the total proceeds of such remarketing of Pledged Notes, the Remarketing Agent will Transfer the Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration purchased from the proceeds of the remarketing to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, which shall thereupon Transfer such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration to the Collateral Agent. Upon receipt of the Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration from the Forward Purchase Contract Agent following a successful remarketing, (i) the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, shall thereupon hold in the Collateral Account such Agent-purchased Treasury Consideration (as defined in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement) to secure such Equity Units Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts and to fund the quarterly interest payment or payments due to Equity Units Holders on the Stock Purchase Date, 12
and (ii) the remaining portion, if any, of the proceeds of such successful remarketing shall be distributed by the Remarketing Agent to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to such Equity Units Holders participating in such remarketing. On the Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent shall, at the direction of the Company, (i) apply that portion of the payments received in respect of the Pledged Treasury Consideration equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the related Equity Units to satisfy in full the obligations of such Equity Units Holders to pay the Purchase Price under the related Forward Purchase Contracts and (ii) apply the remaining portion to pay the quarterly interest payment due to Equity Units Holders on such Stock Purchase Date, which quarterly interest payment shall be paid on the Pledged Notes in an amount equal to the Coupon Rate for such quarterly interest payment. Upon completion of a successful remarketing which occurs on or after the fourth Business Day preceding the Stock Purchase Date, after deducting as the remarketing fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the total proceeds of such remarketing of Pledged Notes, the Remarketing Agent will deliver the proceeds of such remarketing to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, which shall thereupon deliver such proceeds to the Collateral Agent. Upon receipt of the proceeds from the Forward Purchase Contract Agent following a successful remarketing, (i) the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, shall thereupon apply such proceeds in direct settlement of the Equity Units Holders' obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts and (ii) the remaining portion, if any, of the proceeds of such successful remarketing shall be distributed by the Remarketing Agent to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to such Equity Units Holders participating in such remarketing. (b) The Remarketing Agent shall make one or more attempts to remarket the Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement. If by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Stock Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent has failed to remarket the Notes at approximately, but not less than, 100.25% of the Remarketing Value (as described in the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement), the Last Failed Remarketing shall be deemed to have occurred. Within three Business Days following the Last Failed Remarketing, the Notes delivered to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4.5(a) hereof shall be returned to the Collateral Agent, together with written notice from the Remarketing Agent of such Last Failed Remarketing. In this case, the Remarketing Agent shall advise the Collateral Agent in writing that it cannot remarket the related Pledged Notes of such Holders of Equity Units and the Holders of Equity Units that have not made a Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement shall be deemed to have directed the Company to retain or dispose of the Pledged Notes in satisfaction of their obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts. The Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company will, at the written direction of the Company, retain or dispose of the Pledged Notes in accordance with applicable law and satisfy in full, from any such disposition or retention, such Holders' obligations to pay the Purchase Price for the Common Stock; provided, that if upon the Last Failed Remarketing, the Collateral Agent exercises such rights for the benefit of the Company with respect to such Notes, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes will become 13
payable by the Company to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the Equity Units to which such Notes relate in accordance with the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement. (c) In the event a Holder of Stripped Units has not effected a Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the Forward Purchase Contracts underlying its Stripped Units, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Forward Purchase Contracts from the payments received in respect of the related Pledged Treasury Securities. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder, the Collateral Agent shall apply such payments to the settlement of such Forward Purchase Contracts on the Stock Purchase Date. In the event the payments received in respect of the related Pledged Treasury Securities are in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price under the Forward Purchase Contracts being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent shall distribute such excess, when received, to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of such Holders of the Stripped Units. (d) On or prior to the fourth Business Day preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding the last Payment Date before the Stock Purchase Date, holders of Separate Notes may elect to have their Separate Notes remarketed by Transferring their Separate Notes and delivering a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, to the Custodial Agent. On the third Business Day prior to the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the number of such Separate Notes to be remarketed. The Custodial Agent will hold such Separate Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account. A holder of Separate Notes electing to have its Separate Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw such election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, on or prior to the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date or first day of a subsequent Remarketing Period, upon which notice the Custodial Agent will return such Separate Notes to such holder. On the third Business Day immediately preceding the Remarketing Date or the first day of any subsequent Remarketing Period, the Custodial Agent at the written direction of the Remarketing Agent will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all Separate Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to this Section 4.5(d) and not withdrawn pursuant to the terms hereof prior to such date. After deducting as the remarketing fee an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the total proceeds of such remarketing of such Separate Notes, the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent the portion of the proceeds from such remarketing, if successful, equal to the amount calculated in respect of such Separate Notes as set forth in Section 1.6 of the Supplemental Indenture. If, despite using its commercially reasonable best efforts, the Remarketing Agent advises the Custodial Agent in writing that there has been a Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Separate Notes to the Custodial Agent for redelivery to such holders of such Separate Notes. 14

Subject to the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Notes or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement; provided, that the Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or, as the case may be, shall not refrain from exercising such right if, in the judgment of the Company, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse affect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Notes; and provided, further, that the Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Notes, including notice of any meeting at which holders of Notes are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Notes, the Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefor from the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, execute and deliver to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Notes (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent with respect to the Pledged Notes. ARTICLE VI RIGHTS AND REMEDIES; TAX EVENT REDEMPTION SECTION 6.1 Rights and Remedies of the Collateral Agent. (a) In addition to the rights and remedies available at law or in equity, after an event of default under the Forward Purchase Contracts, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor thereto) as in effect in the State of New York from time to time (the "Code") (whether or not the Code is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and the TRADES Regulations and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted. Wherever reference is made in this Agreement to any section of the Code, such reference shall be deemed to include a reference to any provision of the Code, which is a successor to, or amendment of, such section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such remedies may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) retention of the Pledged Notes or other Collateral in full satisfaction of the Holders' 15
obligations under the Forward Purchase Contracts or (ii) sale of the Pledged Notes or other Collateral in one or more public or private sales, in each case at the written direction of the Company. (b) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, in the event the Collateral Agent is unable to make payments to the Company on account of any Pledged Treasury Consideration, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities as provided in Article III hereof in satisfaction of the obligations of the Holder of the Equity Units or Stripped Units of which such Pledged Treasury Consideration, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities, as applicable, are a part under the related Forward Purchase Contracts, the inability to make such payments shall constitute an event of default under the Forward Purchase Contracts and the Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise, with reference to such Pledged Treasury Consideration, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities, as applicable, and such obligations of such Holder, any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Code and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise granted herein or under any other law. (c) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to receive and collect all payments of (i) the principal amount of, or interest on, the Pledged Notes, or (ii) the principal amount of, or interest (if any) on, the Pledged Treasury Consideration, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities, subject, in each case, to the provisions of Article III, and as otherwise granted herein. (d) The Forward Purchase Contract Agent, individually and as attorney-in-fact for each Holder of Equity Units and Stripped Units, agrees that, from time to time, upon the written request of the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company), the Forward Purchase Contract Agent or such Holder shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company) may reasonably request in order to maintain the Pledge, and the perfection and priority thereof, and to confirm the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company) hereunder, except for liability for its own negligent act, its own negligent failure to act, its bad faith or its own willful misconduct. SECTION 6.2 Substitutions. Whenever a Holder has the right to substitute Treasury Securities or Notes for Collateral held by the Collateral Agent, such substitution shall not constitute a novation of the security interest created hereby. 16
SECTION 6.3 Tax Event Redemption. Upon the occurrence of a Tax Event Redemption prior to the earlier of a successful remarketing of the Pledged Notes or the Stock Purchase Date, the aggregate Redemption Price payable on the Tax Event Redemption Date with respect to such Pledged Notes shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent by the Trustee at or prior to 12:00 p.m., New York City time, by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and at such account as may be designated by the Collateral Agent in exchange for the Pledged Notes. In the event the Collateral Agent receives such Redemption Price, the Collateral Agent will, at the written direction of the Company, apply an amount, out of such Redemption Price, equal to the aggregate Tax Event Redemption Principal Amount with respect to the Pledged Notes to purchase from the Quotation Agent the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such Redemption Price to the Forward Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Equity Units. The Collateral Agent shall Transfer the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Account to secure the obligation of all Holders of Equity Units to purchase Common Stock of the Company under the Forward Purchase Contracts constituting a part of such Equity Units, in substitution for the Pledged Notes. Thereafter the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Treasury Portfolio as it had in respect of the Pledged Notes as provided in Articles II, III, IV, V and VI, and any reference herein to the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio, and any reference herein to interest on the Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to distributions on such Treasury Portfolio. ARTICLE VII REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; COVENANTS SECTION 7.1 Representations and Warranties. The Holders from time to time, acting through the Forward Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby represent and warrant to the Collateral Agent, which representations and warranties shall be deemed repeated on each day a Holder Transfers Collateral that: (a) such Holder has the power to grant a security interest in and lien on the Collateral; (b) such Holder is the sole beneficial owner of the Collateral and, in the case of Collateral delivered in physical form, is the sole holder of such Collateral and is the sole beneficial owner of, or has the right to Transfer, the Collateral it Transfers to the Collateral Agent, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance, call, liability to pay money or other restriction other than the security interest and lien granted under Section 2.1 hereof; 17
(c) upon the Transfer of the Collateral to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will have a valid and perfected first priority security interest therein (assuming that any central clearing operation or any Intermediary or other entity not within the control of the Holder involved in the Transfer of the Collateral, including the Collateral Agent, gives the notices and takes the action required of it hereunder and under applicable law for perfection of that interest and assuming the establishment and exercise of control pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof); and (d) the execution and performance by the Holder of its obligations under this Agreement will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on the Collateral other than the security interest and lien granted under Section 2.1 hereof or violate any provision of any existing law or regulation applicable to it or of any mortgage, charge, pledge, indenture, contract or undertaking to which it is a party or which is binding on it or any of its assets. SECTION 7.2 Covenants. The Holders from time to time, acting through the Forward Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any covenant made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby covenant to the Collateral Agent that for so long as the Collateral remains subject to the Pledge: (a) neither the Forward Purchase Contract Agent nor such Holders will create or purport to create or allow to subsist any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge or any other security interest whatsoever over the Collateral or any part of it other than pursuant to this Agreement; and (b) neither the Forward Purchase Contract Agent nor such Holders will sell or otherwise dispose (or attempt to dispose) of the Collateral or any part of it except for the beneficial interest therein, subject to the pledge hereunder, transferred in connection with the sale or other disposition of the Equity Units and Stripped Units. ARTICLE VIII THE COLLATERAL AGENT SECTION 8.1 Appointment, Powers and Immunities.

Each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary: (i) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be inferred 18
from this Agreement against any of them, nor shall any of them be bound by the provisions of any agreement by any party hereto beyond the specific terms hereof; (ii) shall not be responsible for any recitals contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by it under, this Agreement, the Equity Units or Stripped Units or the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement (other than as against the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be), the Equity Units or Stripped Units or the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any failure by the Company or any other Person (except the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or for the perfection, priority or, except as expressly required hereby, existence, validity, perfection or maintenance of any security interest created hereunder; (iii) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder (except in the case of the Collateral Agent, pursuant to written directions furnished under Section 8.2 hereof, subject to Section 8.6 hereof); (iv) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct; and (v) shall not be required to advise any party as to selling or retaining, or taking or refraining from taking any action with respect to, the Equity Units or Stripped Units or other property deposited hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, during the term of this Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall take all reasonable action in connection with the safekeeping and preservation of the Collateral hereunder. (b) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder. In no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary be liable for any amount in excess of the value of the Collateral or for any special, indirect, individual or consequential damages or lost profits or loss of business, arising in connection with this Agreement even if the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage being incurred and regardless of the form of action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent and the Securities Intermediary, each in its individual capacity, hereby waive any right of setoff, 19

Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall impair the right of the Collateral Agent in its discretion to take any action or omit to take any action which it deems proper and which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 8.3 Reliance. Each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled conclusively to rely upon any certification, order, judgment, opinion, notice or other communication (including, without limitation, any thereof by telephone or facsimile) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons (without being required to determine the correctness of any fact stated therein), and upon advice and statements of legal counsel and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, 20

SECTION 8.5 Non-Reliance on Collateral Agent. None of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Equity Units or Stripped Units of this Agreement, the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, the Equity Units or Stripped Units or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the Forward Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder of Equity Units or Stripped Units.

SECTION 8.6 Compensation and Indemnity.

Intermediary, as the case may be, for all services rendered by each of them hereunder, and (b) to indemnify the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and their officers, directors and agents for, and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its powers and duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of such powers and duties or collecting such amounts. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall each promptly notify the Company of any third-party claim which may give rise to the indemnity hereunder and give the Company the opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and no such claim shall be settled without the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The provisions of this Section 8.6 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary or the termination of this Agreement. SECTION 8.7 Failure to Act. In the event of any ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement or any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the parties hereto or any other Person with respect to any funds or property deposited hereunder, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled, after prompt notice to the Company and the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, at its sole option, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with respect to such property or funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall continue, and none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be or become liable in any way to any of the parties hereto for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled to refuse to act until either (i) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing, reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, or (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall have received security or an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, sufficient to save the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, harmless from and against any and all loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense which the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may incur by reason of its acting without willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may in addition elect to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders as the Collateral 22
Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may deem necessary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be required to take any action that is in its opinion contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability. SECTION 8.8 Resignation. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as provided below, (a) the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Forward Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Equity Units and Stripped Units, (b) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company and (c) if the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent. The Forward Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence. The Company shall promptly notify the Forward Purchase Contract Agent of any removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (b) of the second preceding sentence. Upon notice of any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agent's, the Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's giving of notice of resignation or such removal, then the retiring Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, may at the Company's expense petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be. Each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be a bank which has an office in New York, New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or any affiliate of a bank holding company having such capital and surplus.

by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor after the payment of any outstanding fees, expenses and indemnities due and owing to such retiring party. The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Section 8.8, and Section 8.6 hereof, shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary hereunder. Any corporation into which the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, in its individual capacity, may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Collateral Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be respectively, under this Agreement without further act. SECTION 8.9 Right to Appoint Agent or Advisor. The Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint or consult with agents or advisors in connection with any of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith. The appointment of agents (other than legal counsel) pursuant to this Section 8.9 shall be subject to prior consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. SECTION 8.10 Survival. The provisions of this Article VIII shall survive termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. SECTION 8.11 Exculpation. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall any of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or their officers, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement to any third party for indirect, special, punitive or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them, and regardless of the form of action. 24

It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

If the Company shall so determine, new Certificates so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent and the Company, to any such amendment may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement in exchange for outstanding Certificates.

No failure on the part of any party hereto or any of its agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party hereto or any of its agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. SECTION 10.2 GOVERNING LAW.

hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under Section 3 shall have been paid in full; provided, however, that if any Remarketing Agent resigns, then, with respect to such Remarketing Agent, the obligations set forth in Section 3 hereof shall not survive the termination of this Agreement and no fee shall be payable to such Remarketing Agent in such capacity. In addition, each current and former Remarketing Agent shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Sections 9, 10 and 12(b) of this Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of such Remarketing Agent or termination of this Agreement. Section 9. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. ---------------------------------------------- The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions hereof. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement. In the absence of a final judicial determination of willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it which purports to conform to the requirements hereunder as to the truth of the statements expressed therein. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to be signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent shall not have any obligation to determine whether there is any limitation under applicable law on the Reset Rate on the Notes or, if there is any such limitation, the maximum permissible Reset Rate on the Notes, and it shall rely solely upon timely written notice from the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof as to whether or not there is any such limitation and, if so, the maximum permissible Reset Rate. The Remarketing Agent shall not incur any liability under this Agreement to any beneficial owner or holder of Notes, or other securities, either in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, for any action or failure to act in connection with the remarketing of the Notes or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such liability has, by final judicial determination, resulted from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of the Remarketing Agent or from its failure to fulfill its express obligations hereunder. The provisions of this Section 9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall also continue to apply to every Remarketing Agent notwithstanding its resignation or removal. The Remarketing Agent will act as the agent of the Holders. Section 10. Indemnification. ---------------- The Company agrees to indemnify the Remarketing Agent for, and to hold it harmless from and against, any loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its powers and duties under this Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of such powers and duties or collecting such amounts. The Remarketing Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any third
party claim which may give rise to the indemnity hereunder and give the Company the opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and no such claim shall be settled without the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Section 11. Governing Law. -------------- This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Section 12. Term of Agreement. ------------------ (a) Unless otherwise terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof and except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from the date hereof until the third Business Day immediately following the earlier of (i) a successful remarketing, and (ii) the Stock Purchase Date. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of the second and third sentences of Section 8 hereof and the provisions of Sections 3, 9, 10 and 12(b) hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that if any Remarketing Agent resigns, then the obligations set forth in section 3 hereof shall not survive the termination of this Agreement and no fee shall be payable to such remarketing agent in such capacity. (b) All representations and warranties included in this Agreement or contained in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent or any of its controlling persons, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, and shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Section 13. Successors and Assigns. ----------------------- The rights and obligations of the Company and the Forward Purchase Contract Agent (both in its capacity as Forward Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact for the Holders) hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other person (except pursuant to sections 7.9, 7.10 and 7.11 and Article IX of the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement) without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and obligations of the Remarketing Agent hereunder may not be assigned or delegated to any other person without the prior written consent of the Company, except that the Remarketing Agent shall have the right to appoint additional remarketing agents as provided herein. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, the Forward Purchase Contract Agent and the Remarketing Agent and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The terms "successors" and "assigns" shall not include any purchaser of Notes merely because of such purchase.
Section 14. Headings. --------- Section headings have been inserted in this Agreement as a matter of convenience of reference only, and such section headings are not a part of this Agreement and will not be used in the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. Section 15. Severability. ------------- If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, inoperative or unenforceable as applied in any particular case in any or all jurisdictions because it conflicts with any provisions of any constitution, statute, rule or public policy or for any other reason, then, to the extent permitted by law, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case, circumstances or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provision or provisions of this Agreement, as the case may be, invalid, inoperative or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. Section 16. Counterparts. ------------- This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be regarded as an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same document.

Exhibit 5.a.1 June 11, 2002 American Electric Power Company, Inc. 1 Riverside Plaza Columbus, Ohio 43215 Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel to American Electric Power Company, Inc. a New York corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-86050), as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to (i) 16,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $6.50 per share (the "Common Stock") and (ii) 6,000,000 9.25% Equity Units of the Company, consisting of (a) a Forward Purchase Contract (the "Forward Purchase Contracts") and (b) a 5.75% Senior Note (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes were issued under an Indenture dated as of May 1, 2001, as amended and supplemented by a Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 11, 2002 (the "Senior Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Senior Trustee"). The Forward Purchase Contracts were issued pursuant to a Forward Purchase Contract Agreement (the "Forward Purchase Contract Agreement") dated as June 11, 2002 between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Forward Purchase Contract Agent (the "Forward Purchase Contract Agent"). We have examined the Registration Statement, a form of the share certificate, the Senior Indenture and the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement, which have been filed with the Commission as exhibits to the Registration Statement. We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records, agreements, instruments and other documents and have made such other and further investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions expressed herein. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company.
2 In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We also have assumed that: (1) the Senior Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Senior Trustee and (2) the Forward Purchase Contract Agreement is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Forward Purchase Contract Agent. Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Common Stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 2. Assuming the due authentication thereof by the Senior Trustee, the Senior Notes constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms. 3. Assuming the due authentication thereof by the Forward Purchase Contract Agent, the Forward Purchase Contracts constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms. Our opinions set forth in paragraph 2 and 3 above are subject to the effects of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York and the Federal law of the United States. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as Exhibit 5.a.1 to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Opinions" in the Prospectus included in the Registration Statement. Very truly yours SIMPSON THACHER & BARTLETT

Exhibit 8.1 June 6, 2002 RE: Issuance and Sale of Equity Units --------------------------------- American Electric Power Company, Inc. One Riverside Plaza Columbus, Ohio 43215 Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as tax counsel to American Electric Power Company, Inc., a New York corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation and filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") of the Prospectus Supplement dated June 5, 2002 to the Prospectus dated May 17, 2002 (together, the "Prospectus"), which formed a part of the Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Registration Statement"), in respect of the issuance of 6,000,000 (plus an additional 900,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full by the underwriters) Equity Units (the "Equity Units"), consisting of units initially comprised of (i) a purchase contract under which the holder agrees to purchase, and the Company agrees to sell, shares of common stock of the Company on or before August 16, 2005 (a "Purchase Contract") and (ii) a 5.75% Company Senior Note due August 16, 2007 having a $50 stated principal amount (a "Senior Note"). All capitalized terms used in this opinion letter and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Registration Statement.
-2- In delivering this opinion letter, we have reviewed and relied upon (i) the Prospectus; (ii) a form of the Indenture; (iii) a form of the Third Supplemental Indenture; (iv) a form of the Senior Note; (v) a form of the Purchase Contract Agreement; (vi) forms of the Global Stripped Units Certificates; (vii) forms of the Global Equity Units Certificates; (viii) a form of the Remarketing Agreement; (ix) a form of the Pledge Agreement; and (x) a form of the Underwriting Agreement. We also have examined and relied upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records of the Company and such other documents, certificates, representations and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. In such examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as drafts or as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In addition, we also have assumed that factual representations made to us are true, correct and complete and that the transactions related to the issuance of the Equity Units and the Senior Notes will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the documents and forms of documents described herein. If any of the above described assumptions are untrue for any reason or if the issuance of the Equity Units and the Senior Notes is consummated in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner in which it is described in the Registration Statement, our opinion as expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon. Based on the foregoing, it is our opinion that the statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described
-3- therein in all material respects. We express no opinion with respect to the transactions referred to herein or in the Prospectus other than as expressly set forth herein. Our opinion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and other relevant authorities and law, all as in effect on the date hereof. Consequently, future changes in the law may cause the tax treatment of the transactions referred to herein to be materially different from that described in the Prospectus. We disclaim any undertaking to advise you of any subsequent changes of the matters stated, represented or assumed herein or any subsequent changes in applicable law, regulations or interpretations thereof. We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the federal law of the United States. We consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus that forms a part of the Registration Statement. Very truly yours, SIMPSON THACHER & BARTLETT
