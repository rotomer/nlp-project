You agree promptly after the receipt by you of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 7(a) may be sought by you, or by any person controlling you, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof, but your omission so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to you or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(a). In case any such action shall be brought against you or any such person controlling you and you shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof, as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party), to direct the defense thereof at its own expense. In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel (hereinafter, Company's counsel), you or any controlling person shall have the right to employ your own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at your expense unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both you or any controlling person and the Company and you or any controlling person shall have been advised by your counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and you or any controlling person may arise (and the Company's counsel shall have concurred in good faith with such advice) and for this reason it is not desirable for the Company's counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for you or any controlling person (plus any local counsel retained by you or any controlling person in their reasonable judgment), which firm (or firms) shall be designated in writing by you or any controlling person). (b) Each Underwriter agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 7(a) hereof, but only with respect to untrue statements or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions made in the Registration Statement, or in the Basic Prospectus, or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Representatives on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein. The Company agrees promptly after the receipt by it of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from you on account of your agreement contained in this Section 7(b) may be sought by the Company, or by any person controlling the Company, to notify you in writing of the commencement thereof, but the Company's omission so to notify you of any such action shall not release you from any liability which you may have to the Company or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(b). (c) If recovery is not available or insufficient under Section 7(a) or 7(b) hereof for any reason other than as specified therein, the indemnified party shall be entitled to contribution for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification is so unavailable or insufficient under this Section 7(c). In determining the amount of contribution to which such indemnified party is entitled, there shall be considered the portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Shares realized, the relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) without reference to the considerations called for in the previous sentence. No Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter shall be obligated to contribute any amount or amounts hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total price of the Shares purchased by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. An Underwriter's obligation to contribute under this Section 7 is in proportion to its purchase obligation and not joint with any other Underwriter. (d) No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which contribution could be sought under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party. (e) In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent. The agreements contained in Section 7 hereof shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Shares hereunder. 8. Default of Underwriters: If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase and pay for the number of Shares which it has agreed to purchase and pay for hereunder, and the number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the number of the Shares, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the number of Shares set forth opposite their names in Exhibit 1 hereto bear to the number of Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein; provided that in no event shall the number of Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. In the event of any such purchase, (a) the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to fix as a postponed Closing Date a date not exceeding four full business days after the date specified in Section 2 and (b) the respective number of Shares to be purchased by the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be taken as the basis of their respective underwriting obligations for all purposes of this Agreement. If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the number of the Shares then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter; provided, however, that the non-defaulting Underwriters may agree, in their sole discretion, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein. In the event of any such termination, the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter (except to the extent, if any, provided in Section 4(h) hereof), nor shall any Underwriter (other than an Underwriter who shall have failed or refused to purchase the Shares without some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, its termination of its obligations hereunder) be under any liability to the Company or any other Underwriter. Nothing herein contained shall release any defaulting Underwriter from its liability to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 9. Termination of Agreement by the Underwriters: This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by the Representatives if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in the Representatives' reasonable judgment, the Underwriters' ability to market the Shares shall have been materially adversely affected because: (a) trading in securities on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been generally suspended by the Commission or by the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in the securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange, or (b) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other national or international calamity or crisis, or (c) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities. If the Representatives elect to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 9, the Representatives will promptly notify the Company by telephone or by telex or facsimile transmission, confirmed in writing.

(b) An appropriate order of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 has been obtained; such order is sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company; and no other order, consent or other authorization or approval of any United States federal or New York State governmental body (other than in connection or in compliance with the previsions of the securities or "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction, as to which we express no opinion) not already obtained is legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the performance by the Company of its obligations with respect to the Shares and under the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture. (c) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.

(g) The statements made in the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Common Stock," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Company's Common Stock (including the Shares), constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such Common Stock in all material respects. (h) Subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations therein, the statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption "United States Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax laws and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects. Our opinion set forth in paragraph (h) above is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and other relevant authorities and law, all as in effect on the date hereof. Consequently, future changes in the law may cause the tax treatment of the transactions referred to herein to be materially different from that described above. We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraphs (l) and (m) above. In the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents), we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, with your representatives, with Underwriters' counsel, Dewey Ballantine LLP, with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP and with other counsel to the Company. We did not prepare the Exchange Act Documents; however, we reviewed the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, [2001] prior to its filing with the Commission. Based upon our examination of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Exchange Act Documents, our investigations made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (excluding the Exchange Act Documents) and our participation in the conferences referred to above, (i) we are of the opinion that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of February , 2003, complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and that the Exchange Act Documents complied as to form when filed in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no opinion with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents, and (ii) we have no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date (including the Exchange Act Documents on file with the Commission on such effective date), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents) contained as of February , 2003 or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted as February , 2003 or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents. EXHIBIT A-2 OPINION OF THOMAS G. BERKEMEYER, ESQ. (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance of the Shares and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated therein and compliance by the Company with their obligations thereunder do not and will not result in any violation of the charter or bylaws of the Company will not result in the violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ or decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or court having jurisdiction over the Company or its properties or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it may be bound or to which any of its properties may be subject (except for conflicts, breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the Company or materially adverse to the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement). (b) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (c) An appropriate order of the Commission legally required for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, has been obtained; such order is sufficient for the issuance and sale of the Shares by the Company; and the Commission has issued an appropriate order under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the sale of the Shares. No other approval or consent of any governmental body is required for the issuance and sale of the Shares to you or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Supplemental Indenture. I have not considered whether any approval or consent is required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
