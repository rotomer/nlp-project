Prior to joining AEP, Morris was chairman, president and chief executive officer of Northeast Utilities System. "On behalf of the shareholders, customers and employees of AEP I want to express my heartfelt thanks to Linn for his years of dedicated leadership," Morris said. "I'm especially grateful for his help in making my move to AEP a very easy one." "Mike has stepped into his new duties and made a very smooth transition," Draper said. "It is the appropriate time for me to step down and give Mike full leadership of the company." Draper will remain in an advisory capacity with AEP through April.
