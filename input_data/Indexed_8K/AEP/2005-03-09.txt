Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. In February, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of common shares up to an aggregate purchase price of $500 million. On March 8, 2005, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with Merrill Lynch International ("Merrill") pursuant to which the Company repurchased, in an accelerated share repurchase transaction, 12.5 million shares of common stock. The initial price paid per share was $34.63. The repurchase was funded from available cash on hand. The repurchased shares are subject to a future contingent-purchase price adjustment expected to be settled during the second quarter of 2005. The purchase price adjustment will be based upon the prices actually paid by Merrill during the repurchase period and certain other provisions. The common shares repurchased by AEP will be held as treasury stock. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
