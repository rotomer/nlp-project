Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant On March 30, 2005, American Electric Power Company, Inc. ("AEP") entered into a new 5-Year $1,500,000,000 Credit Agreement, dated as of March 30, 2005 (the "Credit Agreement") among American Electric Power Company, Inc., a group of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement is available for working capital and other general corporate purposes of AEP (including, without limitation, to backstop commercial paper issued by AEP). AEP also has the ability to issue letters of credit against the Credit Agreement in an amount up to $200,000,000 in total. The Credit Agreement expires on March 30, 2010. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type, including a requirement that AEP represent that no "material adverse change" has occurred at the time of a new borrowing under the Credit Agreement. A "material adverse change" under the Credit Agreement is any material adverse change (i) in the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or operations of AEP and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) that is reasonably likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement against AEP or the ability of AEP to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement. The base line for any determination of a relative material adverse change is December 31, 2004. If on any date on or before the date of any drawing AEP's rating by Standard & Poor's is BBB or higher and AEP's rating by Moody's is Baa2 or higher, or if the drawing is to retire maturing commercial paper, AEP is not required to represent that no material adverse change of the type described in clause (i), above, has occurred. AEP also is required to maintain its percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%. The Credit Agreement replaces a $1,000,000,000 credit agreement maturing in May 2005, and a $750,000,000 credit agreement maturing in May 2006.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
