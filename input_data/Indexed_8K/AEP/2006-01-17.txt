ITEM: Material Impairments
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
Following the January 12, 2006 public meeting of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the Texas Commission), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) and AEP Texas Central Company (TCC) believe that the Texas Commission has substantially completed its deliberations on TCCs true-up application filed in May, 2005. Based on TCCs understanding of deliberations during several public meetings held to discuss the application, TCC anticipates that the Texas Commission will issue an order that will reduce the amount requested in TCCs true-up application. The major factors contributing to the reduction in TCCs request include the Texas Commissions disallowance of approximately 90% of TCCs proposed wholesale capacity auction true-up and associated carrying costs, a disallowance based on the conclusion that TCC failed to mitigate stranded costs in the sale of its interest in the South Texas Project nuclear generating plant, and the Texas Commissions reduction of TCCs net stranded generation costs by the present value of deferred investment tax credits and excess deferred federal income taxes related to generation plant.
The Texas Commission is not expected to issue its formal written decision until February, 2006 and it is possible that the Texas Commission could modify its views prior to issuing its formal written decision. Based on its analysis of the Texas Commissions deliberations, TCC anticipates recording a charge to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (and a reduction of true-up cash flows in the future) of approximately $384 million ($
250 million,
after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2005. TCC will reduce its recorded net true-up regulatory asset, inclusive of carrying costs, from approximately $1.7 billion to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2005. The ultimate amount of such charge and related cash flows will depend upon the final action of the Texas Commission.
TCC believes that significant aspects of the decisions made to date by the Texas Commission are contrary to both the statute by which the legislature restructured the electric industry in Texas and the regulations and orders the Texas Commission has issued in implementing that statute. TCC will evaluate whether it will seek rehearing of the Texas Commissions rulings once the final written order is issued. TCC may also consider contesting certain of the Texas Commissions rulings through appeals to Texas state courts. Although TCC believes it has meritorious arguments, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome of any requested rehearings or appeals. As a result, TCC expects to record the above impairment charges based on its interpretations of the Texas Commissions deliberations to date.
