On February 27, 2006, the Human Resources Committee (the HR Committee) of the Board of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) approved the performance metrics that will be used to determine the amount of the awards under AEPs Senior Officer Incentive Plan (the SOIP) for 2006 for AEPs executive officers. The performance metrics are based on (i) safety performance, (ii) operations measures, such as plant availability, (iii) results of regulatory proceedings and (iv) strategic initiatives, such as diversity and strategic development of new generation assets. Each of the performance metrics will be weighted at 25%. The overall funding level for AEPs incentive plans, including the SOIP, will be based on the extent to which AEPs earnings per share meets or exceeds the 2006 target approved by AEPs Board of Directors. However, this overall funding level may be adjusted, either positively or negatively, by the HR Committee.
On February 28, 2006, the independent members of the AEP Board of Directors awarded Michael G. Morris a bonus award of $2,250,000 for 2005.
