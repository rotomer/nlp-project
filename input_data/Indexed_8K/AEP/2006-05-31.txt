On May 25, 2006, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (the Registrant) received notice that the American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan, the American Electric Power System Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan, the American Electric Power System Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan and the American Electric Power Company, Inc. Retainer Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the Plans) will be changing record keepers (currently Fidelity Investments) effective July 1, 2006, and a number of the Plans investment options will change. The notice states that, as a result, participants temporarily will be unable to reallocate investments in their individual accounts, and, to the extent applicable, obtain loans from the Plans or obtain a distribution from the Plans. This period, during which participants will be unable to exercise these rights otherwise available under the Plans, is called a blackout period.
The blackout period is expected to begin on June 27, 2006 for the American Electric Power System Retirement Savings Plan (the last day for participants to change future investment elections and deferral elections at the current record keeper, Fidelity) and June 30, 2006 for the other plans (the last day for participants in each of the Plans to access their accounts through the Fidelity phone line and to make investment exchanges, including those involving
the AEP Stock Fund). The blackout period is expected to end and all of the Plans are expected resume operations with JPMorgan providing administrative and recordkeeping services on July 5, 2006.
 
The Registrant received the notice required by Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, on May 25, 2006.
Inquiries
concerning the blackout should be directed to JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services, as the plan recordkeeper, at

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
