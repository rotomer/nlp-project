ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
     The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K,  is being furnished, not filed, under Item 7.01.
   
 
On July 5, 2006, the Supreme Court of Ohio vacated the order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approving the Rate Stabilization Plan (RSP) of Columbus Southern Power Company and Ohio Power Company (together, AEP Ohio).
 
In its order, the Ohio Supreme Court vacated AEP Ohios RSP and remanded it to the PUCO for further proceedings, similar to the Courts remand of First Energys RSP in May of this year. In the earlier Court decision, the Court remanded the First Energy RSP on the grounds that the RSP did not provide customers with a competitive bid generation supply option, as contemplated by the Ohio electric utility industry restructuring law. AEP Ohio has ten days to file a request for reconsideration. If AEP Ohio does not request reconsideration or if the Court turns down a request, the RSP will return to the PUCO for reconsideration, which is currently considering how to address the First Energy RSP.
Under Ohio legal precedents, AEP Ohio believes it can continue to collect rates reflecting the RSP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
