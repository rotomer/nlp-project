On August 30, 2006, the Board of Directors of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) approved the sale of AEPs DOW Cogeneration Facility (Facility) in Plaquemine, Louisiana to The Dow Chemical Company for $64 million and other consideration. The Board approved the sale following consideration of various operating options associated with the Facility. As a result of the Board approval, in the third quarter of 2006 the Facility will be reported as Held For Sale in AEPs Consolidated Balance Sheets and AEP expects to report a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million ($136 million after tax). The sale is expected to close in December 2006. The sale is subject to federal regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
Upon closing, AEP will repay its recorded $525 million lease financing obligation with the proceeds from the sale and corporate borrowings.
