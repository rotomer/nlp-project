On October 10, 2006, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) established an ongoing earnings guidance range of $2.85 and $3.05 per share in 2007, $3.00 and $3.30 per share in 2008 and $3.15 and $3.45 per share in 2009. In providing ongoing earnings guidance, there could be differences between ongoing earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for matters such as, but not limited to, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. AEP management is not able to estimate the impact, if any, on GAAP earnings of these items. Therefore, AEP is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for earnings guidance. AEP uses ongoing earnings guidance as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding its earnings outlook and results. AEP also uses ongoing earnings data internally to measure performance against budget and to report to AEPs board of directors.
On October 10, 2006, AEP also announced (1) that its management would recommend in October 2006 that the AEP board of directors increase the quarterly dividend by $0.02 per share beginning in December 2006 which would increase the annual dividend approximately five percent to $1.56 per share from $1.48 per share, and (2) that it was reducing its combined 2007 and 2008 capital investment forecast by $528 million.
