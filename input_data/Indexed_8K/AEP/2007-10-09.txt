ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
As previously disclosed,the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the states of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maryland, Rhode Island and Massachusetts (the States) and fourteen special interest groups alleged that Appalachian Power Company (APCo), Columbus Southern Power Company (CSP), Indiana Michigan Power Company (I&M) and Ohio Power Company (OPCo) (collectively, the AEP Subsidiaries) modified certain of their coal-fired generating plants in violation of the New Source Review requirements of the Clean Air Act. The EPA filed its complaints against the AEP Subsidiaries in two cases pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.
 
On October 9, 2007, American Electric Power Company (AEP) and the AEP Subsidiaries announced that they have reached a settlement agreement with the EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the States and the special interest groups. Under the settlement agreement, AEP agreed to annual sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) emission limits for sixteen of the AEP Subsidiaries coal-fired power plants located in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia. In addition to completing the installation of previously announced environmental retrofit projects at many of the plants, including the installation of flue gas desulfurization (FGD or scrubbers) equipment at Kentucky Power Companys Big Sandy Plant and at OPCos Muskingum River Plant by the end of 2015, AEP agreed to install selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and FGD emissions control equipment on AEP Generating Companys and I&Ms jointly owned generating units at the Rockport Plant. Unit 1 at the Rockport Plant will be retrofit by the end of 2017, and Unit 2 will be retrofit by the end of 2019. AEP also agreed to install selective non-catalytic reduction, a NOX-reduction technology, by the end of 2009 at APCOs Clinch River Plant.
AEP also agreed to operate its SCRs year round during 2008 at APCos Mountaineer Plant, OPCos Muskingum River Plant and APCos and OPCos jointly owned Amos Plant, and agreed to plant-specific SO2 emission limits for APCos Clinch River Plant and OPCos Kammer Plant.
Under the settlement agreement, AEP will pay a $15 million civil penalty to the DOJ and provide $36 million for environmental projects coordinated with the federal government and $24 million to the States for environmental mitigation.
The settlement agreement, upon approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, will resolve all issues related to various parties claims against the AEP Subsidiaries in the two pending New Source Review cases. The settlement agreement is in the form of a consent decree and has been lodged with the U.S. District Court. The settlement agreement is subject to final approval by the Court, and is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Disputes submitted to dispute resolution under this Section shall, in the first instance, be the subject of informal negotiations among the disputing Parties.  Such period of informal negotiations shall not extend beyond thirty (30) days from the date of the first meeting among the disputing Parties representatives unless they agree in writing to shorten or extend this period.  During the informal negotiations period, the disputing Parties may also submit their dispute to a mutually agreed upon alternative dispute resolution (ADR) forum if the Parties agree that the ADR activities can be completed within the 30-day informal negotiations period (or such longer period as the Parties may agree to in writing).
 
170.
  
If the disputing Parties are unable to reach agreement during the informal negotiation period, the Plaintiffs shall provide Defendants with a written summary of their position regarding the dispute.  The written position provided by Plaintiffs shall be considered binding unless, within forty-five (45) days thereafter, Defendants seek judicial resolution of the dispute by filing a petition with this Court.  The Plaintiffs may respond to the petition within forty-five (45) days of filing.  In their initial filings with the Court under this Paragraph, the disputing Parties shall state their respective positions as to the applicable standard of law for resolving the particular dispute.
 
171.
  
The time periods set out in this Section may be shortened or lengthened upon motion to the Court of one of the Parties to the dispute, explaining the Partys basis for seeking such a scheduling modification.
 
172.
  
This Court shall not draw any inferences nor establish any presumptions adverse to any disputing Party as a result of invocation of this Section or the disputing Parties inability to reach agreement.
 
173.
  
As part of the resolution of any dispute under this Section, in appropriate circumstances the disputing Parties may agree, or this Court may order, an extension or modification of the schedule for the completion of the activities required under this Consent Decree to account for the delay that occurred as a result of dispute resolution.  Defendants shall be liable for stipulated penalties for their failure thereafter to complete the work in accordance with the extended or modified schedule, provided that Defendants shall not be precluded from asserting that a Force Majeure Event has caused or may cause a delay in complying with the extended or modified schedule.
 
174.
  
The Court shall decide all disputes pursuant to applicable principles of law for resolving such disputes.  In their initial filings with the Court under Paragraph 170, the disputing Parties shall state their respective positions as to the applicable standard of law for resolving the particular dispute.
 
 
175.
  
Unless expressly stated otherwise in this Consent Decree, in any instance where otherwise applicable law or this Consent Decree requires Defendants to secure a permit to authorize construction or operation of any device contemplated herein, including all preconstruction, construction, and operating permits required under state law, Defendants shall make such application in a timely manner.  Defendants shall provide Notice to Plaintiffs under Section XVIII (Notices), for each Unit that Defendants submit an application for any permit described in this Paragraph 175.
 
176.
  
Notwithstanding the previous Paragraph, nothing in this Consent Decree shall be construed to require Defendants to apply for or obtain a PSD or Nonattainment NSR permit for physical changes in, or changes in the method of operation of, any AEP Eastern System Unit that would give rise to claims resolved by Paragraph 132 and 133, subject to Paragraphs 134 through 138, or Paragraphs 139 and 141 of this Consent Decree.
 
177.
  
When permits are required as described in Paragraph 175, Defendants shall complete and submit applications for such permits to the appropriate authorities to allow time for all legally required processing and review of the permit request, including requests for additional information by the permitting authorities.  Any failure by Defendants to submit a timely permit application for any Unit in the AEP Eastern System shall bar any use by Defendants of Section XIV (Force Majeure) of this Consent Decree, where a Force Majeure claim is based on permitting delays.
 
178.
  
Notwithstanding the reference to Title V permits in this Consent Decree, the enforcement of such permits shall be in accordance with their own terms and the Act.  The Title V permits shall not be enforceable under this Consent Decree, although any term or limit established by or under this Consent Decree shall be enforceable under this Consent Decree regardless of whether such term or limit has or will become part of a Title V permit, subject to the terms of Section XXVI (Conditional Termination of Enforcement Under Decree) of this Consent Decree.
 
179.
  
Within three (3) years from the Date of Entry of this Consent Decree, and in accordance with federal and/or state requirements for modifying or renewing a Title V permit, Defendants shall amend any applicable Title V permit application, or apply for amendments to their Title V permits, to include a schedule for any Unit-specific performance, operational, maintenance, and control technology requirements established by this Consent Decree including, but not limited to, required emission rates or other limitations.  For Units subject to a requirement to Retire, Retrofit, or Re-power, Defendants shall apply to modify, renew, or obtain any applicable Title V permit to include a schedule for any Unit-specific performance, operation, maintenance, and control technology requirements established by this Consent Decree including, but not limited to, required emission rates or other limitations, within (12) twelve months of making such election to Retire, Retrofit, or Re-power.
 
180.
  
Within one (1) year from commencement of operation of each pollution control device to be installed, upgraded, and/or operated under this Consent Decree, Defendants shall apply to include the requirements and limitations enumerated in this Consent Decree into federally-enforceable non-Title V permits and/or site-specific amendments to the applicable state implementation plans to reflect all new requirements applicable to each Unit in the AEP Eastern System, the Plant-Wide Annual Rolling Average Tonnage Limitation for SO at Clinch River, and the Plant-Wide Annual Tonnage Limitation for SO at Kammer.

181.
  
Defendants shall provide the United States with a copy of each application for a federally-enforceable non-Title V permit or amendment to a state implementation plan, as well as a copy of any permit proposed as a result of such application, to allow for timely participation in any public comment period.
 
182.
  
Prior to termination of this Consent Decree, Defendants shall obtain enforceable provisions in their Title V permits for the AEP Eastern System that incorporate (a) any Unit-specific requirements and limitations of this Consent Decree, such as performance, operational, maintenance, and control technology requirements, (b) the Plant-Wide Annual Rolling Average Tonnage Limitation for SO at Clinch River and the Plant-Wide Annual Tonnage Limitation for SO at Kammer, and (c) the Eastern System-Wide Annual Tonnage Limitations for SO and NO.  If Defendants do not obtain enforceable provisions for the Eastern System-Wide Annual Tonnage Limitations for SO and NO in such Title V permits, then the requirements in Paragraphs 86 and 67 shall remain enforceable under this Consent Decree and shall not be subject to termination.

If Defendants sell or transfer to an entity unrelated to Defendants (Third-Party Purchaser) part or all of Defendants Ownership Interest in a Unitin the AEP Eastern System, Defendants shall comply with the requirements of Section XIX (Sales or Transfers of Operational or Ownership Interests) with regard to that Unit prior to any such sale or transfer unless, following any such sale or transfer, Defendants remain the holder of the Title V permit for such facility.
 
 
184.
  
Any authorized representative of the United States, including attorneys, contractors, and consultants, upon presentation of credentials, shall have a right of entry upon the premises of any facility in the AEP Eastern System at any reasonable time for the purpose of:

 Defendants shall retain, and instruct their contractors and agents to preserve, all non-identical copies of all records and documents (including records and documents in electronic form) now in their or their contractors or agents possession or control (with the exception of their contractors copies of field drawings and specifications), and that directly relate to Defendants performance of their obligations under this Consent Decree until six (6) years following completion of performance of such obligations.  This record retention requirement shall apply regardless of any corporate document retention policy to the contrary.
 
186.
  
All information and documents submitted by Defendants pursuant to this Consent Decree shall be subject to any requests under applicable law providing public disclosure of documentsunless (a) the information and documents are subject to legal privileges or protection or (b) Defendants claim and substantiate in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 2 that the information and documents contain confidential business information.
 
 
187.
  
Nothing in this Consent Decree shall limit the authority of EPA to conduct tests and inspections at Defendants facilities under Section 114 of the Act, 42 U.S.C.  7414, or any other applicable federal or state laws, regulations, or permits.

189.
  
All notifications, communications, or submissions made pursuant to this Section shall be sent as follows:  (a) by overnight mail or overnight delivery service to the United States; and (b) by electronic mail to all Plaintiffs, if practicable, but if not practicable, then by overnight mail or overnight delivery service to the States and Citizen Plaintiffs.  All notifications, communications, and transmissions sent by overnight delivery service shall be deemed submitted on the date they are delivered to the delivery service.
 
190.
  
Any Party may change either the notice recipient or the address for providing notices to it by serving all other Parties with a notice setting forth such new notice recipient or address.
 
191.
  
If Defendants propose to sell or transfer an Operational or Ownership Interest to an entity unrelated to Defendants (Third Party), they shall advise the Third Party in writing of the existence of this Consent Decree prior to such sale or transfer, and shall send a copy of such written notification to the Plaintiffs pursuant to Section XVIII (Notices) of this Consent Decree at least sixty (60) days before such proposed sale or transfer.
 
192.
  
No sale or transfer of an Operational or Ownership Interest shall take place before the Third Party and Plaintiffs have executed, and the Court has approved, a modification pursuant to Section XXII (Modification) of this Consent Decree making the Third Party a party to this Consent Decree and jointly and severally liable with Defendants for all the requirements of this Decree that may be applicable to the transferred or purchased Interests.
 
193.
  
This Consent Decree shall not be construed to impede the transfer of any Interests between Defendants and any Third Party so long as the requirements of this Consent Decree are met.  This Consent Decree shall not be construed to prohibit a contractual allocation  as between Defendants and any Third Party  of the burdens of compliance with this Decree, provided that both Defendants and such Third Party shall remain jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the Consent Decree applicable to the transferred or purchased Interests.
 
194.
  
If the Plaintiffs agree, the Plaintiffs, Defendants, and the Third Party that has become a party to this Consent Decree pursuant to Paragraph 192, may execute a modification that relieves Defendants of liability under this Consent Decree for, and makes the Third Party liable for, all obligations and liabilities applicable to the purchased or transferred Interests.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Defendants may not assign, and may not be released from, any obligation under this Consent Decree that is not specific to the purchased or transferred Interests, including the obligations set forth in Section VIII (Environmental Mitigation Projects), Paragraphs 86 and 67, and Section IX (Civil Penalty).  Defendants may propose and the Plaintiffs may agree to restrict the scope of the joint and several liability of any purchaser or transferee for any obligations of this Consent Decree that are not specific to the transferred or purchased Interests, to the extent such obligations may be adequately separated in an enforceable manner.
 
195.
  
Defendants may propose and Plaintiffs may agree to restrict the scope of joint and several liability of any purchaser or transferee for any AEP Eastern System obligations to the extent such obligations may be adequately separated in an enforceable manner using the methods provided by or approved under Section XVI (Permits).
 
196.
  
Paragraphs 191-195 of this Consent Decree do not apply if an Interest is sold or transferred solely as collateral security in order to consummate a financing arrangement (not including a sale-leaseback), so long as Defendants: (a) remain the operator (as that term is used and interpreted under the Clean Air Act) of the subject AEP Eastern System Unit(s); (b) remain subject to and liable for all obligations and liabilities of this Consent Decree; and (c) supply Plaintiffs with the following certification within thirty (30) days of the sale or transfer:
 
.  We, the Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel of American Electric Power Service Corp. (AEP), hereby jointly certify under Title 18 U.S.C. Section 1001, on our own behalf and on behalf of AEP, that any change in AEPs Ownership Interest in any AEP Eastern System Unit that is caused by the sale or transfer as collateral security of such Ownership Interest in such Unit(s) pursuant to the financing agreement consummated on [insert applicable date] between AEP and [insert applicable entity]: a) is made solely for the purpose of providing collateral security in order to consummate a financing arrangement; b) does not impair AEPs ability, legally or otherwise, to comply timely with all terms and provisions of the Consent Decree entered in Civil Action No. C2-99-1250 (AEP I) and , Civil Action Nos. C2-04-1098 and C2-05-360 (AEP II); c) does not affect AEPs operational control of any Unit covered by that Consent Decree in a manner that is inconsistent with AEPs performance of its obligations under the Consent Decree; and d) in no way affects the status of AEPs obligations or liabilities under that Consent Decree.

The effective date of this Consent Decree shall be the Date of Entry.
 
198.
  
The Court shall retain jurisdiction of this case after the Date of Entry of this Consent Decree to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions of this Consent Decree and to take any action necessary or appropriate for its interpretation, construction, execution, modification, or adjudication of disputes.  During the term of this Consent Decree, any Party to this Consent Decree may apply to the Court for any relief necessary to construe or effectuate this Consent Decree.
 
199.
  
The terms of this Consent Decree may be modified only by a subsequent written agreement signed by the Plaintiffs and Defendants.  Where the modification constitutes a material change to any term of this Decree, it shall be effective only upon approval by the Court.
 
200.
  
This Consent Decree is not a permit.  Compliance with the terms of this Consent Decree does not guarantee compliance with all applicable federal, state, or local laws or regulations.  The limitations and requirements set forth herein do not relieve Defendants from any obligation to comply with other state and federal requirements under the Clean Air Act at any Units covered by this Consent Decree, including the Defendants obligation to satisfy any state modeling requirements set forth in a state implementation plan.
 
201.
  
This Consent Decree does not apply to any claim(s) of alleged criminal liability.
 
202.
  
In any subsequent administrative or judicial action initiated by any of the Plaintiffs for injunctive relief or civil penalties relating to the facilities covered by this Consent Decree, Defendants shall not assert any defense or claim based upon principles of waiver,  , collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, claim preclusion, or claim splitting, or any other defense based upon the contention that the claims raised by any of the Plaintiffs in the subsequent proceeding were brought, or should have been brought, in the instant case; provided, however, that nothing in this Paragraph affects the validity of Paragraphs Paragraph 132 and 133, subject to Paragraphs 134 through 138, or Paragraphs 139 and 141.

203.
  
Except as specifically provided by this Consent Decree, nothing in this Consent Decree shall relieve Defendants of their obligation to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  Subject to the provisions in Section X (Resolution of Civil Claims Against Defendants), nothing contained in this Consent Decree shall be construed to prevent or limit the rights of the Plaintiffs to obtain penalties or injunctive relief under the Act or other federal, state, or local statutes, regulations, or permits.
 
204.
  
At any time prior to termination of this Consent Decree, Defendants may request approval from Plaintiffs to implement other control technology for SO or NO than what is required by this Consent Decree.  In seeking such approval, Defendants must demonstrate that such alternative control technology is capable of achieving pollution reductions equivalent to an FGD (for SO) or SCR (for NO) at the Units in the AEP Eastern System at which Defendants seek approval to implement such other control technology for SO or NO.  Approval of such a request is solely at the discretion of the Plaintiffs.

Nothing in this Consent Decree is intended to, or shall, alter or waive any applicable law (including but not limited to any defenses, entitlements, challenges, or clarifications related to the Credible Evidence Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 8314 (Feb. 24, 1997)) concerning the use of data for any purpose under the Act generated either by the reference methods specified herein or otherwise.
 
206.
  
Each limit and/or other requirement established by or under this Consent Decree is a separate, independent requirement.
 
207.
  
Performance standards, emissions limits, and other quantitative standards set by or under this Consent Decree must be met to the number of significant digits in which the standard or limit is expressed.  For example, an Emission Rate of 0.100 is not met if the actual Emission Rate is 0.101.  Defendants shall round the fourth significant digit to the nearest third significant digit, or the third significant digit to the nearest second significant digit, depending upon whether the limit is expressed to three or two significant digits.  For example, if an actual Emission Rate is 0.1004, that shall be reported as 0.100, and shall be in compliance with an Emission Rate of 0.100, and if an actual Emission Rate is 0.1005, that shall be reported as 0.101, and shall not be in compliance with an Emission Rate of 0.100.  Defendants shall report data to the number of significant digits in which the standard or limit is expressed.
 
208.
  
This Consent Decree does not limit, enlarge, or affect the rights of any Party to this Consent Decree as against any third parties.
 
209.
  
This Consent Decree constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive agreement and understanding among the Parties with respect to the settlement embodied in this Consent Decree, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings among the Parties related to the subject matter herein.  No document, representation, inducement, agreement, understanding, or promise constitutes any part of this Consent Decree or the settlement it represents, nor shall they be used in construing the terms of this Consent Decree.
 
210.
  
Except for Citizen Plaintiffs, each Party to this action shall bear its own costs and attorneys fees.  Defendants shall reimburse the Citizen Plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  7604(d), and the agreement between counsel for Defendants and Citizen Plaintiffs within thirty (30) days of the Date of Entry of this Consent Decree.
 
211.
  
Each undersigned representative of the Parties certifies that he or she is fully authorized to enter into the terms and conditions of this Consent Decree and to execute and legally bind to this document the Party he or she represents.
 
212.

213.
  
Each Party hereby agrees to accept service of process by mail with respect to all matters arising under or relating to this Consent Decree and to waive the formal service requirements set forth in Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and any applicable Local Rules of this Court including, but not limited to, service of a summons.
 
214.
  
The Parties agree and acknowledge that final approval by the United States and the entry of this Consent Decree is subject to the procedures of 28 C.F.R.  50.7, which provides for notice of lodging of this Consent Decree in the Federal Register, an opportunity for public comment, and the right of the United States to withdraw or withhold consent if the comments disclose facts or considerations which indicate that the Consent Decree is inappropriate, improper, or inadequate.  The Defendants shall not oppose entry of this Consent Decree by this Court or challenge any provision of this Consent Decree unless the United States has notified the Defendants, in writing, that the United States no longer supports entry of the Consent Decree.
 
215.
  
  As soon as Defendants complete a construction project or any other requirement of this Consent Decree that is not ongoing or recurring, Defendants may, by motion to this Court, seek termination of the provision or provisions of this Consent Decree that imposed the requirement.
Termination as to Completed Tasks.
 
216.
  
  After Defendants:
Conditional Termination of Enforcement Through the Consent Decree.
then Defendants may so certify these facts to the Plaintiffs and this Court.  If the Plaintiffs do not object in writing with specific reasons within forty-five (45) days of receipt of Defendants certification, then, for any Consent Decree violations that occur after the filing of notice, the Plaintiffs shall pursue enforcement of the requirements contained in the Title V permit through the applicable Title V permit and not through this Consent Decree.
 
217.
  
  Notwithstanding Paragraph 216, if enforcement of a provision in this Consent Decree cannot be pursued by a Party under the applicable Title V permit, or if a Consent Decree requirement was intended to be part of a Title V Permit and did not become or remain part of such permit, then such requirement may be enforced under the terms of this Consent Decree at any time.
Resort to Enforcement under this Consent Decree.
 
218.
  
Upon approval and entry of this Consent Decree by the Court, this Consent Decree shall constitute a final judgment among the Parties.
