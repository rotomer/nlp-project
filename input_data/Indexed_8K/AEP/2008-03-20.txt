Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.
 
               
(a)
Any Officers Certificate may be based (without further examination or investigation), insofar as it relates to or is dependent upon legal matters, upon an opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless, in any case, such officer has actual knowledge that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which such Officers Certificate may be based as aforesaid are erroneous.
 
               
Any Opinion of Counsel may be based (without further examination or investigation), insofar as it relates to or is dependent upon factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Company, upon a certificate of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company, as the case may be, unless such counsel has actual knowledge that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous.

Whenever, subsequent to the receipt by the Trustee of any Board Resolution, Officers Certificate, Opinion of Counsel or other document or instrument, a clerical, typographical or other inadvertent or unintentional error or omission shall be discovered therein, a new document or instrument may be substituted therefor in corrected form with the same force and effect as if originally filed in the corrected form and, irrespective of the date or dates of the actual execution and/or delivery thereof, such substitute document or instrument shall be deemed to have been executed and/or delivered as of the date or dates required with respect to the document or instrument for which it is substituted. Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if any such corrective document or instrument indicates that action has been taken by or at the request of the Company which could not have been taken had the original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be and remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that such action was a result of willful misconduct or bad faith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Securities issued under the authority of such defective document or instrument shall nevertheless be the valid obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of this Indenture equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Securities, except as aforesaid.
 
SECTION 104.
          
Acts of Holders.

Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the Act of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments and so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 901) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.
 
               
(c)
The ownership, principal amount (except as otherwise contemplated in clause (y) of the first proviso to the definition of Outstanding) and serial numbers of Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the Security Register.
 
               
(d)
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, election, waiver or other Act of a Holder shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
 
               
(e)
Until such time as written instruments shall have been delivered to the Trustee with respect to the requisite percentage of principal amount of Securities for the action contemplated by such instruments, any such instrument executed and delivered by or on behalf of a Holder may be revoked with respect to any or all of such Securities by written notice by such Holder or any subsequent Holder, proven in the manner in which such instrument was proven.
 
               
(f)
Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after any Act of Holders may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any action taken by such Act of Holders. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to such action may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series or Tranche.
 
               
(g)
The Company may, at its option, by Company Order, as appropriate, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act solicited by the Company, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so; provided, however, that the Company may not fix a record date for the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next sentence. In addition, the Trustee may, at its option, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to join in the giving or making of any Notice of Default, any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 802, any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 807 or any direction referred to in Section 812. If any such record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, or such notice, declaration, request or direction, may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining (i) whether Holders of the requisite proportion of the Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such Act (and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of the record date) and/or (ii) which Holders may revoke any such Act (notwithstanding subsection (e) of this Section ); and any such Act, given as aforesaid, shall be effective whether or not the Holders which authorized or agreed or consented to such Act remain Holders after such record date and whether or not the Securities held by such Holders remain Outstanding after such record date.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.
 
               
Any notice required by this Indenture may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event otherwise to be specified therein, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
          
SECTION 107.

The signature of any or all of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
 
               
A Security bearing the manual or facsimile signature of an individual who was at the time of execution an Authorized Officer of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that any such individual
 
 
 
has ceased to be an Authorized Officer prior to the authentication and delivery of the Security or did not hold such office at the date of such Security.
 
               
The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of a series, for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance with the Company Order referred to below, upon receipt by the Trustee of:
 
               
(a)
the instrument or instruments establishing the form or forms and terms of the Securities of such series, as provided in Sections 201 and 301;
 
               
(b)
a Company Order requesting the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and, to the extent that the terms of such Securities shall not have been established in an indenture supplemental hereto or in a Board Resolution, or in an Officers Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or Board Resolution, all as contemplated by Sections 201 and 301, either (i) establishing such terms or (ii) in the case of Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, specifying procedures, acceptable to the Trustee, by which such terms are to be established (which procedures may provide, to the extent acceptable to the Trustee, for authentication and delivery pursuant to oral or electronic instructions from the Company or any agent or agents thereof, which oral instructions are to be promptly confirmed electronically or in writing), in either case in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuant to clause (a) above;
 
               
(c)
Securities of such series, each executed on behalf of the Company by an Authorized Officer of the Company;
 
               
(d)
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:
 
               
(i)
(A) the forms of such Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and the forms of the Securities have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
               
(ii)
(A) the terms of such Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and the terms of the Securities have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
               
(iii)
such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will have been duly issued under this Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits provided by this Indenture, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy and insolvency laws and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
 
provided, however, that, with respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be provided with such Opinion of Counsel only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication and delivery of Securities of such series, and that in lieu of the opinions described in clauses (ii) and (iii) above such Opinion of Counsel may, alternatively, state, respectively,
 
          
(x) that, when the terms of such Securities shall have been established pursuant to a Company Order or Orders or Orders or pursuant to such procedures as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order or Orders, all as contemplated by and in accordance with the instrument or instruments delivered pursuant to clause (a) above, such terms will have been duly authorized by the Company, and will have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
 
 
          
(y) that such Securities, when (1) executed by the Company, (2) authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture, (3) issued and delivered by the Company and (4) paid for, all as contemplated by and in accordance with the aforesaid Company Order or Orders or specified procedures, as the case may be, will have been duly issued under this Indenture and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to enforcement, to laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy and insolvency laws and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
 
               
With respect to Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the forms and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 and this Section, as applicable, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such series, unless and until such opinion or other documents have been superseded or revoked or expire by their terms. In connection with the authentication and delivery of Securities of a series, pursuant to a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall be entitled to assume that the Companys instructions to authenticate and deliver such Securities, do not violate any applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or commission having jurisdiction over the Company.
 
               
If the forms or terms of the Securities of any series have been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or an Officers Certificate as permitted by Sections 201 or 301, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issuance of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will adversely affect the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
               
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of securities, or any Tranche thereof, each Security, shall each be dated the date of its authentication.
 
               
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, or any Tranche thereof, no Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or its agent by manual signature of an authorized officer thereof, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder to the Company, or any Person acting on its behalf, but shall never have been issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits hereof.
 
SECTION 304.
          
Temporary Securities.
 
               
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities; provided, however, that temporary Securities need not recite specific redemption, sinking fund, conversion or exchange provisions.
 
               
If temporary Securities of any series or Tranche are issued, the Company shall cause definitive Securities of such series or Tranche to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series or Tranche, the temporary Securities of such series or Tranche shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series or Tranche, upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series or Tranche
 
 
 
at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such series or Tranche, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series or Tranche, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Securities of the same series or Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
 
               
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and Tranche and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder.
 
SECTION 305.
          
Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
 
               
The Company shall cause to be kept in one of the offices or agencies designated pursuant to Section 602, with respect to the Securities of each series or any Tranche thereof, a register (the Security Register) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities of such series or Tranche and the registration of transfer thereof. The Company shall designate one Person to maintain the Security Register for the Securities of each series, and such Person is referred to herein, with respect to such series, as the Security Registrar. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may designate one or more of its offices or an office of any Affiliate as an office in which a register with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche or Tranches thereof, shall be maintained, and the Company may designate itself or any Affiliate as the Security Registrar with respect to one or more of such series. The Security Register shall be open for inspection by the Trustee and the Company at all reasonable times.
 
               
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of such series or Tranche at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 602 in a Place of Payment for such series or Tranche, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
 
               
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, any Security of such series or Tranche may be exchanged at the option of the Holder for one or more new Securities of the same series and Tranche, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities, which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
               
All Securities delivered upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company evidencing the same obligation, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
               
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed or shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
               
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, with respect to Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, no service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 406 or 1206 not involving any transfer.
 
               
The Company shall not be required to execute or to provide for the registration of transfer of or the exchange of (a) Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, during a period of 15 days immediately preceding the date notice is to be given identifying the serial numbers of the Securities of such series or Tranche called for
 
 
 
redemption or (b) any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
          
SECTION 306.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
 
               
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
               
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to their satisfaction of the ownership of and the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably required by them to save each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, new Security of the same series and Tranche, and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
               
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
               
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) in connection therewith.
 
               
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone other than the Holder of such new Security, and any such new Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly issued hereunder.
 
               
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
SECTION 307.
          
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
 
               
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
               
Subject to Section 312, any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called Defaulted Interest) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the related Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:
 
               
(a)
The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a date (a Special Record Date) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory
 
 
 
to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall promptly cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date.
 
               
(b)
The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
 
               
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
          
SECTION 308.
Persons Deemed Owners.
 
               
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether not such Security be overdue, and none of the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever or which the Company shall not have issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee.

Computation of Interest.
 
               
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, or Tranche thereof, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, and with respect to any period less than a full calendar month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during such period.
 
 
 
          
SECTION 311.
Payment to Be in Proper Currency.
 
               
In the case of any Security denominated in any currency other than Dollars or in a composite currency (the Required Currency), except as otherwise specified with respect to such Security as contemplated by Section 301, the obligation of the Company to make any payment of the principal thereof, or the premium, if any, or interest, if any, thereon, shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender by the Company, or recovery by the Trustee, in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the Trustee timely holding the full amount of the Required Currency then due and payable. If any such tender or recovery is in a currency other than the Required Currency, the Trustee may take such actions as it considers appropriate to exchange such currency for the Required Currency. The costs and risks of any such exchange, including without limitation the risks of delay and exchange rate fluctuation, shall be borne by the Company and the Company shall remain fully liable for any shortfall or delinquency in the full amount of Required Currency then due and payable, and in no circumstances shall the Trustee be liable therefor except in the case of its negligence or willful misconduct. The Company hereby waives any defense of payment based upon any such tender or recovery which is not in the Required Currency, or which, when exchanged for the Required Currency by the Trustee, is less than the full amount of Required Currency then due and payable.
 
SECTION 312.
          
Extension of Interest Payment.
 
               
The Company shall have the right at any time, so long as no Event of Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of any series, to extend interest payment periods from time to time on all Securities of such series, if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Securities and upon such terms as may be specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Securities.
 
          
SECTION 313.
Additional Interest.
 
               
So long as any Preferred Securities remain outstanding, if the Trust which issued such Preferred Securities shall be required to pay, with respect to its income derived from the interest payments on the Securities of any series, any amounts for or on account of any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed by the United States, or any other taxing authority, then, in any such case, the Company will pay as interest on such series such additional interest (Additional Interest) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received and retained by such Trust after the payment of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges shall result in such Trusts having such funds as it would have had in the absence of any such payments.
 
               
Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of interest on the Securities, such mention shall be deemed to include the payment of Additional Interest to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest is, was or would be payable in respect thereof.
 
          
SECTION 314.
CUSIP Numbers.
 
               
The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP or other similar numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Company or the Trustee may use CUSIP or such other numbers in notices or redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, in which case neither the Company nor the Trustee, nor any agent of either of them, shall have any liability in respect of any CUSIP or such other numbers used on any such notice, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

SECTION 402.
Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
 
               
The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or an Officers Certificate. The Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee and, in the case of Securities of series held by a Trust, the Property Trustee under the related Trust Agreement in writing of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of such Securities to be redeemed, provided that the Trustee be given a draft notice least 15 days prior to the giving of the notice of redemption. In the case of any redemption of Securities (a) prior the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture or (b) pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.
 
          
SECTION 403.
Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.
 
               
If less than all the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee from the Outstanding Securities of such series or Tranche not previously called for redemption, by such method as shall be provided for such particular series or Tranche, or in the absence of any such provision, by such method of random selection as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may, in any case, provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to any authorized denomination for Securities of such series or Tranche) of the principal amount of Securities of such series or Tranche of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or Tranche; provided, however, that if, as indicated in an Officers Certificate, the Company shall have offered to purchase all or any principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding of any series, or any Tranche thereof, and less than all of such Securities as to which such offer was made shall have been tendered to the Company for such purchase, the Trustee, if so directed by Company Order, shall select for redemption all or any principal amount of such Securities which have not been so tendered.
 
               
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected to be redeemed in part, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
 
               
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
          
SECTION 404.
Notice of Redemption.
 
               
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities in accordance with Section 301, notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106 to the Holders of Securities to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date.
 
               
All notices of redemption shall state:
 
               
(a)
the Redemption Date,
 
               
(b)
the Redemption Price, or the formula pursuant to which the Redemption Price is to be determined if the Redemption Price cannot be determined at the time the notice is given,
 
               
(c)
if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series or Tranche are to be redeemed, the identification of the particular Securities to be redeemed and the portion of the principal amount of any Security to be redeemed in part,
 
 
 
               
(d)
that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date, will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
 
               
(e)
the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, unless it shall have been specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Securities that such surrender shall not be required,
 
               
(f)
that the redemption is for a sinking or other fund, if such is the case,
 
               
(g)
the CUSIP numbers, if any, assigned to such Securities; provided, however, that such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of CUSIP numbers, and the redemption of such Securities shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers, and
 
               
(h)
such other matters as the Company shall deem desirable or appropriate.
 
               
Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities in accordance with Section 301, with respect to any notice of redemption of Securities at the election of the Company, unless, upon the giving of such notice, the redemption moneys are on deposit with the Trustee, such redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Paying Agent or Agents for such Securities, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on such Securities and, if such money shall not have been so received, such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such Securities. In the event that such money is not so received, the redemption shall not be made and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not so received and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Paying Agent or Agents for the Securities otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.
 
               
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of a condition for redemption as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, on Company Request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
 
          
SECTION 405.
Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
 
               
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, and the conditions, if any, set forth in such notice having been satisfied, the Securities or portions thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any) such Securities or portions thereof, if interest-bearing, shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with such notice, such Security or portion thereof shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that no such surrender shall be a condition to such payment if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security; and provided, further, that except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security, any installment of interest on any Security the Stated Maturity of which installment is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holder of such Security, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the related Regular Record Date according to the terms of such Security and subject to the provisions of Sections 305 and 307.
 
SECTION 406.
          
Securities Redeemed in Part.
 
               
Upon the surrender of any Security which is to be redeemed only in part at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
 
 
 
authorized in writing), the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and Tranche, of any authorized denomination requested by such Holder and of like tenor and in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is herein referred to as a mandatory sinking fund payment, and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is herein referred to as an optional sinking fund payment. If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 502.

Securities so applied shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
 
SECTION 503.
          
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
 
               
Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate specifying:

If the Company shall not deliver such Officers Certificate, the next succeeding sinking fund payment for such series or Tranche shall be made entirely in cash in the amount of the mandatory sinking fund payment. Not less than 40 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 403 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 404. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 405 and 406.

The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of each such office or agency and prompt notice to the Holders of any such change in the manner specified in Section 106. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, payment of such Securities may be made, registration of transfer or exchange thereof may be effected and notices and demands in respect thereby may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and each of the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent for all such purposes in any such event.
 
               
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, for any or all of the foregoing purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of such series or Tranche, no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency for such purposes in each Place of Payment for such Securities in accordance with the requirements set forth above. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee, and prompt notice to the Holders in the manner specified in Section 106, of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

The Company may at any time pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent and, if as stated in a Company Order delivered to the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of Article Seven; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
               
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such payment to the Company, may at the expense of the Company, either (a) cause to be mailed, on one occasion only, notice to such Holder that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such mailing, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to the Company or (b) cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be paid to the Company.

Rights of Holders of Preferred Securities.

SECTION 701.
          
Satisfaction and Discharge of Securities.
 
               
Any Security or Securities, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, shall be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, and the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof shall be satisfied and discharged, if there shall have been irrevocably deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent (other than the Company), in trust:
 
               
(a)
money in an amount which shall be sufficient, or
 
               
(b)
in the case of a deposit made prior to the Maturity of such Securities or portions thereof, Eligible Obligations, which shall not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, the principal of and the interest on which when due, without any regard to reinvestment thereof, will provide moneys which, together with the money, if any, deposited with or held by the Trustee or such Paying Agent, shall be sufficient, or
 
               
(c)
a combination of (a) or (b) which shall be sufficient,
 
to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest [(including any Additional Interest)], if any, due and to become due on such Securities or portions thereof; provided, however, that in the case of the provision for
 
 
 
payment or redemption of less than all the Securities of any series or Tranche, such Securities or portions thereof shall have been selected by the Trustee as provided herein and, in the case of a redemption, the notice requisite to the validity of such redemption shall have been given or irrevocable authority shall have been given by the Company to the Trustee to give such notice, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee; and provided, further, that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee and such Paying Agent:
 
          
(x)      if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Securities, a Company Order stating that the money and Eligible Obligations deposited in accordance with this Section shall be held in trust, as provided in Section 603;
 
          
(y)      if Eligible Obligations shall have been deposited, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such obligations constitute Eligible Obligations and do not contain provisions permitting the redemption or other prepayment thereof at the option of the issuer thereof, and an opinion of an independent public accountant of nationally recognized standing, selected by the Company, to the effect that the other requirements set forth in clause (b) and (c) above have been satisfied; and
 
          
(z)      if such deposit shall have been made prior to the Maturity of such Securities, an Officers Certificate stating the Companys intention that, upon delivery of such Officers Certificate, its indebtedness in respect of such Securities or portions thereof will have been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section.
 
               
Upon the deposit of money or Eligible Obligations, or both, in accordance with this Section, together with the documents required by clauses (x), (y) and (z) above, the Trustee shall, upon Company Request, acknowledge in writing that such Securities or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture and that the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof has been satisfied and discharged as contemplated in this Section. In the event that all of the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph shall have been satisfied in respect of any Securities or portions thereof except that, for any reason, the Officers Certificate specified in clause (z) (if otherwise required) shall not have been delivered, such Securities or portions thereof shall nevertheless be deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, and the Holders of such Securities or portions thereof shall nevertheless be no longer entitled to the benefits provided by this Indenture or of any of the covenants of the Company under Article Six (except the covenants contained in Sections 602 and 603) or any other covenants made in respect of such Securities or portions thereof as contemplated by Section 301 or Section 1201(b), but the indebtedness of the Company in respect of such Securities or portions thereof shall not be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged prior to Maturity for any other purpose; and, upon Company Request, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing that such Securities or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture.
 
               
If payment at Stated Maturity of less than all of the Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, is to be provided for in the manner and with the effect provided in this Section, the Trustee shall select such Securities, or portions of principal amount thereof, in the manner specified by Section 403 for selection for redemption of less than all the Securities of a series or Tranche.
 
               
In the event that Securities which shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, in respect of which the Companys indebtedness shall have been satisfied and discharged, all as provided in this Section, do not mature and are not to be redeemed within the sixty (60) day period commencing with the date of the deposit of moneys or Eligible Obligations, as aforesaid, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, give a notice, in the same manner as a notice of redemption with respect to such Securities, to the Holders of such Securities to the effect that such deposit has been made and the effect thereof.
 
               
Notwithstanding that any Securities shall be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee in respect of such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 403, 404, 406, 602, 603, 907, 908, 909, 910 and 915 and this Article shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
 
               
The Company shall pay, and shall indemnify the Trustee or any Paying Agent with which Eligible
 
 
 
Obligations shall have been deposited as provided in this Section against, any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against such Eligible Obligations or the principal or interest received in respect of such Eligible Obligations, including, but not limited to, any such tax payable by any entity deemed, for tax purposes, to have been created as a result of such deposit.
 
               
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) if, at any time after a Security would be deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, and, if such is the case, the Companys indebtedness in respect thereof would be deemed to have been satisfied and discharged, pursuant to this Section (without regard to the provisions of this paragraph), the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case may be, (i) shall be required to return the money or Eligible Obligations, or combination thereof, deposited with it as aforesaid to the Company or its representative under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or (ii) are unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, such Security shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been paid and any satisfaction and discharge of the Companys indebtedness in respect thereof shall retroactively be deemed not to have been effected, and such Security shall be deemed to remain Outstanding and (b) any satisfaction and discharge of the Companys indebtedness in respect of any Security shall be subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 603.
 
SECTION 702.
          
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
 
               
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as hereinafter expressly provided), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute such instruments as the Company shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when:
 
               
(a)
no Securities remain Outstanding hereunder; and
 
               
(b)
the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company;
 
provided, however, that if, in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 701, any Security, previously deemed to have been paid for purposes of this Indenture, shall be deemed retroactively not to have been so paid, this Indenture shall thereupon be deemed retroactively not to have been satisfied and discharged, as aforesaid, and to remain in full force and effect, and the Company shall execute and deliver such instruments as the Trustee shall reasonably request to evidence and acknowledge the same.
 
               
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as aforesaid, the obligations of the Company and the Trustee under Sections 304, 305, 306, 403, 404, 406, 602, 603, 907, 908, 909, 910 and 915 and this Article shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
 
               
Upon satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as provided in this Section, the Trustee shall turn over to the Company any and all money, securities and other property then held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities (other than money and Eligible Obligations held by the Trustee pursuant to Section 703) and shall execute and deliver to the Company such instruments as, in the judgment of the Company, shall be necessary, desirable or appropriate to effect or evidence the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

Application of Trust Money.
 
               
Neither the Eligible Obligations nor the money deposited pursuant to Section 701, nor the principal or interest payments on any such Eligible Obligations, shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than, and shall be held in trust for, the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities or portions of principal amount thereof in respect of which such deposit was made, all subject, however, to the provisions of Section 603; provided, however, that any cash received from such principal or interest payments on such Eligible Obligations, if not then needed for such purpose, shall, to the extent practicable and upon Company Request and delivery to the Trustee of the documents referred to in clause (y) in the first paragraph of Section 701,
 
 
 
be invested in Eligible Obligations of the type described in clause (b) in the first paragraph of Section 701 maturing at such times and in such amounts as shall be sufficient, together with any other moneys and the proceeds of any other Eligible Obligations then held by the Trustee, to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, due and to become due on such Securities or portions thereof on and prior to the Maturity thereof, and interest earned from such reinvestment shall be paid over to the Company as received, free and clear of any trust, lien or pledge under this Indenture (except the lien provided by Section 907); and provided, further, that any moneys held in accordance with this Section on the Maturity of all such Securities in excess of the amount required to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, then due on such Securities shall be paid over to the Company free and clear of any trust, lien or pledge under this Indenture (except the lien provided by Section 907); and provided, further, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, moneys to be paid over to the Company pursuant to this Section shall be held until such Event of Default shall have been waived or cured.

(b)

SECTION 802.
          
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
 
               
Unless otherwise provided as contemplated in Section 301, if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (c) of the definition thereof in Section 801) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series may declare the principal amount of all Securities of such series (or, if any of the Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 301) and interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately (provided that the payment of principal and interest on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in this Indenture), by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon receipt by the Company of notice of such declaration of acceleration, such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable; provided, however, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to all outstanding series of Securities, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 33% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series, considered as one class, may make such declaration of acceleration, and not the Holders of the Securities of any one of such series (provided that the payment of principal and interest on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in this Indenture).
 
               
Neither the Trustee nor the Holders shall be entitled to make a declaration of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default specified in clause (c) of the definition thereof, and no series of Securities as to which such an Event of Default is the only Event of Default shall be considered outstanding for the purpose of determining whether the required vote, as specified in the preceding paragraph, has been obtained.
 
               
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series shall have been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due shall have been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if
 
               
(a)
the Company shall have paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
 
               
(1)
all overdue interest, if any, on all Securities of such series then Outstanding;
 
               
(2)
the principal of and premium, if any, on any Securities of such series then Outstanding which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of
 
 
 
acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities;
 
               
(3)
to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities;
 
               
(4)
all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907;
 
and
 
               
(b)
all Events of Default with respect to Securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of such series which shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been cured or waived as provided in Section 813.
 
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 803.
          
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
 
               
If an Event of Default described in clause (a) or (b) of Section 801 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of the series with respect to which such Event of Default shall have occurred, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on premium, if any, and on any overdue principal and interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, the rate or rates at which Securities shall bear interest on overdue principal, premium, and interest, if any, shall be, to the extent permitted by law, the same rate or rates at which such Securities shall bear interest prior to Maturity.
 
               
If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.
 
               
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
          
SECTION 804.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
 
               
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
 
               
(a)
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for amounts due to the Trustee under Section 907) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
 
 
 
               
(b)
to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
 
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amounts due it under Section 907.
 
               
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, be a member of a creditors or similar other committee.
 
SECTION 805.
          
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
 
               
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
 
SECTION 806.
          
Application of Money Collected.
 
               
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, to the extent permitted by law, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or premium, if any, or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money shall have been collected and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
 
               
First

Second

Third

SECTION 807.
          
Limitation on Suits.
 
               
No Holder shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
 
               
(a)
such Holder shall have previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series;

(c)
such Holder or Holders shall have offered to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it in its reasonable judgment against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
 
               
(d)
the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such proceeding; and
 
               
(e)
no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, considered as one class;
 
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.
 
SECTION 808.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and (subject to Section 307 and 312) interest, if any, on such Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. In addition, in the case of Securities of a series held by a Trust, a holder of Preferred Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder of principal of or interest on the Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation preference amount of the Preferred Securities of such holder on or after the due dates specified or provided for in the Securities.

Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
 
               
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and such Holder shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
          
SECTION 810.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
 
               
Except as otherwise provided in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
 
          
SECTION 811.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
 
               
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
 
 
 
          
SECTION 812.
Control by Holders of Securities.
 
               
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing in respect of a series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series; provided, however, that if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to more than one series of Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all such series, considered as one class, shall have the right to make such direction, and not the Holders of the Securities of any one of such series; and provided, further, that
 
               
(a)
such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and could not involve the Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where indemnity would not, in the Trustees sole discretion, be adequate, and
 
               
(b)
the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
 
          
SECTION 813.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
 
               
The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default
 
               
(a)
in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Security of such series, or
 
               
(b)
in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Section 1202 cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
 
; provided, however, that so long as a Trust holds the Securities of any series, such Trust may not waive any past default without the consent of at least a majority in aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding Preferred Securities issued by such Trust affected, obtained as provided in the Trust Agreement pertaining to such Trust. Any such waiver by holders of a majority in aggregate liquidation preference of outstanding Preferred Securities issued by any such Trust shall be deemed to be on behalf of all holders of Preferred Securities issued by any such Trust.
 
               
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any and all Events of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
SECTION 814.
          
Undertaking for Costs.
 
               
The Company and the Trustee agree, and each Holder by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant, in each case in the manner, to the extent, and subject to the exceptions provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided, that the provisions of this Section shall not be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.
 
 
 
SECTION 815.
          
Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws.
 
               
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
 
 
SECTION 901.
          
Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

(b)
In case an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall exercise, with respect to Securities of such series, such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
 
               
(c)

(4)
no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
               
(d)
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

(b)
The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company.

(c)
The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Trustee and the Company; provided that so long as any Preferred Securities remain outstanding, the Trust which issued such Preferred Securities shall not execute any Act to remove the Trustee without the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate liquidation preference of Preferred Securities issued by such Trust outstanding, obtained as provided in the Trust Agreement pertaining to such Trust.

(d)
If at any time:

the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
 
then, in any such case, (x) the Company by Board Resolutions may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities or (y) subject to Section 814, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
 
               
(e)
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause (other than as contemplated by clause (y) in subsection (d) or this Section), with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by Board Resolutions, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time (subject to Section 915) there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 911. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 911, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 911, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
               
(f)
So long as no event which is, or after notice or lapse of time, or both, would become, an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, and except with respect to a Trustee appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section, if the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee (i) Board Resolutions of the Company appointing a successor Trustee, effective as of a date specified therein, and (ii) an instrument of acceptance of such appointment, effective as of such date, by such successor Trustee in accordance with Section 911, the Trustee shall be deemed to have resigned as contemplated in subsection (b) of this Section, the successor Trustee shall be deemed to have been appointed by the Company pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section and such appointment shall be deemed to have been accepted as contemplated in Section 911, all as of such date, and all other provisions of this Section and Section 911 shall be applicable to such resignation, appointment and acceptance except to the extent inconsistent with this subsection (f).
 
               
(g)

If the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities (other than by reason of a relationship described in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act), the Trustee
 
 
 
shall be subject to any and all applicable provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company or such other obligor. For purposes of Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act (a) the term cash transaction shall have the meaning provided in Rule 11b-4 under the Trust Indenture Act, and (b) the term self-liquidating paper shall have the meaning provided in Rule 11b-6 under the Trust Indenture Act.
 
SECTION 914.
          
Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
 
               
The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series or Tranche issued upon original issuance, exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustees certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
               
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
 
               
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee, and the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
 
               
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
 
               
The provisions of Sections 308, 904 and 905 shall be applicable to each Authenticating Agent.
 
               
If an appointment with respect to the Securities of one or more series, or any Tranche thereof, shall be made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series or Tranche may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustees certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the following form:
 
               
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

If all of the Securities of a series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Securities upon original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to have Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), shall appoint, in accordance with this Section and in accordance with such procedures as shall be acceptable to the Trustee, an Authenticating Agent having an office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such series of Securities.
 
SECTION 915.
          
Co-trustee and Separate Trustees.
 
               
At any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of any applicable jurisdiction, the Company and the Trustee shall have power to appoint, and, upon the written request of the Trustee or of the Holders of at least 33% in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding, the Company shall for such purpose join with the Trustee in the execution and delivery of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved by the Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Trustee, or to act as separate trustee, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. If the Company does not join in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment.
 
               
Should any written instrument or instruments from the Company be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee to more fully confirm to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Company, as the case may be.
 
               
Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following conditions:
 
               
(a)
the Securities shall be authenticated and delivered, and all rights, powers, duties and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustee hereunder, shall be exercised solely, by the Trustee;
 
               
(b)
the rights, powers, duties and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed either by the Trustee or by the Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee.
 
               
(c)
the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the
 
 
 
concurrence of the Company, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section, and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Company. Upon the written request of the Trustee, the Company shall join with the Trustee in the execution and delivery of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section;
 
               
(d)
no co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Trustee, or any other such trustee hereunder, and the Trustee shall not be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any such co-trustee or separate trustee; and
 
               
(e)
any Act of Holders delivered to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.

SECTION 1002.

Reports so required to be transmitted at stated intervals of not more than 12 months shall be transmitted no later than May 15 in each calendar year with respect to the 12-month period ending on the next preceding May 15, commencing May 15, 2008. A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange upon which any Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will notify the Trustee when any Securities are listed on or delisted from any stock exchange.
 
               
The Company shall file with the Trustee (within thirty (30) days after filing with the Commission in the case of reports that pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act must be filed with the Commission and furnished to the Trustee) and transmit to the Holders, such other information, reports and other documents, if any, at such times and in such manner, as shall be required by the Trust Indenture Act.
 
               
Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).

(c)
the Company, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance or other transfer or lease and such indenture supplemental hereto complies with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transactions have been complied with.

SECTION 1202.
          
Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.
 
               
Subject to the provisions of Section 1201, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series then Outstanding under this Indenture, considered as one class, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee the Company, when authorized by Board Resolutions, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, this Indenture; provided, however, that if there shall be Securities of more than one series Outstanding hereunder and if a proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such series, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that if the Securities of any series shall have been issued in more than one Tranche and if the proposed supplemental indenture shall directly affect the rights of the Holders of Securities of one or more, but less than all, of such Tranches, then the consent only of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all Tranches so directly affected, considered as one class, shall be required; and provided, further, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of each series or Tranche so directly affected,
 
               
(a)

or any premium or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or
 
               
(b)

It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. A waiver of a Holders right to consent under this Section shall be deemed to be a consent of such Holder.

SECTION 1205.
          
Conformity With Trust Indenture Act.

Securities of any series, or any Tranche thereof, authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture.

SECTION 1207.
          
Modification Without Supplemental Indenture.
 
               
To the extent, if any, that the terms of any particular series of Securities shall have been established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or an Officers Certificate pursuant to a supplemental indenture or Board Resolution as contemplated by Section 301, and not in an indenture supplemental hereto, additions to, changes in or the elimination of any of such terms may be effected by means of a supplemental Board Resolution or Officers Certificate, as the case may be, delivered to, and accepted by, the Trustee; provided, however, that such supplemental Board Resolution or Officers Certificate shall not be accepted by the Trustee or otherwise be effective unless all conditions set forth in this Indenture which would be required to be satisfied if such additions, changes or elimination were contained in a supplemental indenture shall have been appropriately satisfied. Upon the acceptance thereof by the Trustee, any such supplemental Board Resolution or Officers Certificate shall be deemed to be a supplemental indenture for purposes of Section 1204 and 1206.

The Persons entitled to vote a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of the series and Tranches with respect to which a meeting shall have been called as hereinbefore provided, considered as one class, shall constitute a quorum for a meeting of Holders of Securities of such series and Tranches; provided, however, that if any action is to be taken at such meeting which this Indenture expressly provides may be taken by the Holders of a specified percentage, which is less than a majority, in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series and Tranches, considered as one class, the Persons entitled to vote such specified percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series and Tranches, considered as one class, shall constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum within one hour of the time appointed for any such meeting, the meeting shall, if convened at the request of Holders of Securities of such series and Tranches, be dissolved. In any other case the meeting may be adjourned for such period as may be determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such meeting. In the absence of a quorum at any such adjourned meeting, such adjourned meeting may be further adjourned for such period as may be determined by the chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such adjourned meeting. Except as provided by Section 1305(e), notice of the reconvening of any meeting adjourned for more than 30 days shall be given as provided in Section 1302(a) not less than ten days prior to the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Notice of the reconvening of an adjourned meeting shall state expressly the percentage, as provided above, of the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series and Tranches which shall constitute a quorum.
 
               
Except as limited by Section 1202, any resolution presented to a meeting or adjourned meeting duly reconvened at which a quorum is present as aforesaid may be adopted only by the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of the series and Tranches with respect to which such meeting shall have been called, considered as one class; provided, however, that, except as so limited, any resolution with respect to any action which this Indenture expressly provides may be taken by the Holders of a specified percentage, which is less than a majority, in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series and Tranches, considered as one class, may be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned meeting duly reconvened and at which a quorum is present as aforesaid by the affirmative vote of the Holders of such specified percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series and Tranches, considered as one class.

Attendance at Meetings; Determination of Voting Rights; Conduct and Adjournment of Meetings.
 
               
(a)
Attendance at meetings of Holders of Securities may be in person or by proxy; and, to the extent permitted by law, any such proxy shall remain in effect and be binding upon any future Holder of the Securities with respect to which it was given unless and until specifically revoked by the Holder or future Holder of such Securities before being voted.
 
               
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of Securities in regard to proof of the holding of such Securities and of the appointment of proxies and in regard to the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate. Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding of Securities shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104 and the appointment of any proxy shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104. Such regulations may provide that written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 104 or other proof.
 
               
(c)
The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by the Company or by Holders as provided in Section 1302(b), in which case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the series and Tranches calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series and Tranches represented at the meeting, considered as one class.

The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified written reports of all votes cast at the meeting. A record, in duplicate, of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that said notice was given as provided in Section 1302 and, if applicable, Section 1304. Each copy shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such copy shall be delivered to the Company, and another to the Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting. Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated.

Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness of the Company.
 
               
The Company, for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees, and each Holder of the Securities of each series, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on each and all of the Securities is hereby expressly subordinated and subject to the extent and in the manner set forth in this Article, in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

(1)
the holders of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall first be entitled to receive payment of the full amount due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or moneys worth, before the Holders of any of the Securities are entitled to receive a payment on account of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities, including, without limitation, any payments made pursuant to Articles Four and Five;
 
               
(2)
any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which any Holder or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article, shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company held
 
 
 
or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company, before any payment or distribution is made to the Holders of the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities or to the Trustee under this Indenture; and
 
               
(3)
in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, in respect of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities or in connection with any repurchase by the Company of the Securities, shall be received by the Trustee or any Holder before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money or moneys worth, such payment or distribution in respect of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities or in connection with any repurchase by the Company of the Securities shall be paid over to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness of the Company may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company.
 
               
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the 123rd day following the date of deposit of cash or Eligible Obligations pursuant to Section 701 or 702 (provided all conditions set out in such Section shall have been satisfied), the funds so deposited and any interest thereon will not be subject to any rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company including, without limitation, those arising under this Article Fourteen; provided that no event described in clauses (e) and (f) of Section 801 with respect to the Company has occurred during such 123-day period.
 
               
For purposes of this Article only, the words cash, property or securities shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan or reorganization or readjustment which are subordinate in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at the time be outstanding to the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article Eleven hereof shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 1402 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article Eleven hereof. Nothing in Section 1401 or in this Section 1402 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 907.
 
SECTION 1403.
          
Disputes with Holders of Certain Senior Indebtedness of the Company.

SECTION 1404.
          
Subrogation.
 
               
Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall not be deemed to have been paid in full unless the holders thereof shall have received cash (or securities or other property satisfactory to such holders) in full payment of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company then outstanding. Upon the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the rights of the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive any further payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company until all amounts owing on the Securities shall be paid in full; and such payments or distributions of cash, property or securities received by the Holders of the Securities, by reason of such subrogation, which otherwise would be paid or distributed to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and the Holders, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, it being understood that the provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company, on the other hand.

Obligation of the Company Unconditional.
 
               
Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
 
               
Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon, and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article.
 
               
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or a representative of such holder or a trustee under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness of the Company may have been issued) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company or such representative or trustee on behalf of such holder. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness of the Company held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the right of such Person under this Article, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment or distribution.
 
SECTION 1406.
          
Priority of Senior Indebtedness of the Company Upon Maturity.
 
               
Upon the maturity of the principal of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise, all matured principal of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and interest and premium, if any, thereon shall first be paid in full before any payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest, if any, is made upon the Securities or before any Securities can be acquired by the Company or any sinking fund payment is made with respect to the Securities (except that required sinking fund payments may be reduced by Securities acquired before such maturity of such Senior Indebtedness of the Company).
 
 
 
SECTION 1407.

The Trustee shall be entitled to all rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Article shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 907.
 
SECTION 1408.
          
Notice to Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.
 
               
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any other provision of the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Trustee unless and until the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company, from a Holder or from a holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or from any representative or representatives of such holder or any trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any such Senior Indebtedness of the Company may have been issued and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee shall be entitled, subject to Section 901, in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that, if prior to the fifth Business Day preceding the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, or in the event of the execution of an instrument pursuant to Section 701 or 702 acknowledging that Securities or portions thereof are deemed to have been paid for all purposes of this Indenture, acknowledging that the entire indebtedness of the Company in respect thereof has been satisfied and discharged or acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, then if prior to the second Business Day preceding the date of such execution, the Trustee shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee may, in its discretion, receive such moneys and/or apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary, which may be received by it on or after such date; provided, however, that no such application shall affect the obligations under this Article of the persons receiving such moneys from the Trustee.
 
SECTION 1409.
          
Modification, Extension, etc. of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.
 
               
The holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, without affecting in any manner the subordination of the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities, at any time or from time to time and in their absolute discretion, agree with the Company to change the manner, place or terms of payment, change or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, or amend or supplement any instrument pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness of the Company is issued, or exercise or refrain from exercising any other of their rights under the Senior Indebtedness of the Company including, without limitation, the waiver of default thereunder, all without notice to or assent from the Holders or the Trustee.
 
SECTION 1410.
          
Trustee Has No Fiduciary Duty to Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company.
 
               
With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and objectives as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or deliver to the Holders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.
 
SECTION 1411.
          
Paying Agents Other Than the Trustee.
 
               
In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term Trustee as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the
 
 
 
Trustee; provided, however, that Sections 1407, 1408 and 1410 shall not apply to the Company if it acts as Paying Agent.
 
SECTION 1412.
          
Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company Not Impaired.
 
               
No right of any present or future holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with.
 
SECTION 1413.
          
Effect of Subordination Provisions; Termination.
 
               
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, other than as provided in the immediately succeeding sentence, all the provisions of this Indenture shall be subject to the provisions of this Article, so far as the same may be applicable thereto.
 
               
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the provisions of this Article Fourteen shall be of no further effect, and the Securities shall no longer be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, if the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a notice to such effect. Any such notice delivered by the Company shall not be deemed to be a supplemental indenture for purposes of Article Twelve.
 
SECTION 1414.
          
Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent.
 
               
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, Custodian, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article.
 
 
SECTION 1501.
          
Liability Solely Corporate.
 
               
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Securities or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, or of the indebtedness represented thereby, or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement under this Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future of the Company or of any predecessor or successor of either of them (either directly or through the Company, as the case may be, or a predecessor or successor of either of them), whether by virtue of any constitutional provision, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that this Indenture and all the Securities are solely corporate obligations, and that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, or be incurred by, any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, either directly or indirectly through the Company or any predecessor or successor of either of them, because of the indebtedness hereby authorized or under or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities or to be implied herefrom or therefrom, and that any such personal liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as part of the consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issuance of the Securities.
 
 
 
               
This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

Section 4.                      .  (a)  The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the Termination Date) to occur of (i) March 1, 2038, or if earlier, the date on which the Subordinated Debentures are otherwise paid, redeemed, defeased or purchased in full (in compliance with the terms of Section 2 of this Replacement Capital Covenant), (ii) the date, if any, on which the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the then-effective Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of the obligations of the Corporation hereunder, (iii) the date on which the Corporation has no outstanding Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (b) of the definition of each such term) and (iv) the date on which the Subordinated Debentures are accelerated as a result of an event of default under the Indenture.  From and after the Termination Date, the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be of no further force and effect with respect to the Holders or otherwise.
Termination and Amendment
 
(b)           This Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed by the Corporation with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority of outstanding principal amount of the then-effective Covered Debt, provided that this Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Corporation (and without the consent of the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt) if any of the following apply (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement may fall into one or more of the following): (i) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, Rights to acquire Common Stock, Common Equity Units and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities, if, in the case of this clause, after the date of this Replacement Capital Covenant, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing accounting standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to eliminate Common Stock, Rights to acquire Common Stock, Common Equity Units and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities would result in a reduction in the Corporations earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (EPS), or the Corporation otherwise has been advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to eliminate such securities as Replacement Capital Securities would result in a reduction of the Corporations EPS, (ii) the effect of such amendment or supplement is solely to impose additional restrictions on the ability of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries to redeem, defease or purchase the Subordinated Debentures or to impose additional restrictions on, or to eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities (other than securities which are covered by clause (i) above) and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture or other instrument under which such long-term indebtedness for borrowed money was issued a written certificate to that effect, (iii) such amendment or supplement extends the date specified in Section 4(a)(i), the Stepdown Date, or both or (iv) such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the rights of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt hereunder and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture or other instrument under which such long-term indebtedness for money borrowed was issued a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not adverse to the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt.  For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of Replacement Capital Securities or modifies the requirements of the Replacement Capital Securities described herein would not be adverse to the rights of the Holders of Covered Debt if, following such amendment or supplement, this Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy the definition of Explicit Replacement Covenant.
 
(c)           For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement this Replacement Capital Covenant or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.
 
Section 5.                      
Miscellaneous

(b)           This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be binding upon the Corporation and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Debtholders as they exist from time-to-time (it being understood and agreed by the Corporation that any Person who is a Covered Debtholder shall retain its status as a Covered Debtholder for so long as the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money owned by such Person is Covered Debt and, if such Person initiates a claim or proceeding to enforce its rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant after the Corporation has violated its covenants in Section 2 and before the series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed held by such Person is no longer Covered Debt, such Persons rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall not terminate by reason of such series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed no longer being Covered Debt).  The Corporation agrees that, if at any time the Covered Debt is held by a trust (for example, where the Covered Debt is part of an issuance of trust preferred securities), a holder of the securities issued by such trust may enforce (including by instituting legal proceedings) this Replacement Capital Covenant directly against the Corporation as though such holder owned the Covered Debt directly, and the holders of such trust securities shall be deemed Holders of Covered Debt for purposes of this Replacement Capital Covenant for so long as the indebtedness held by such trust remains Covered Debt hereunder.  Other than the Covered Debtholders as provided in the two previous sentences, no other Person shall have any rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant or be deemed a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant.  In particular, no holder of the Subordinated Debentures is a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant, it being understood that such holders may have rights under the Indenture.
 
(c)           All demands, notices, requests and other communications to the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if in writing and (i) if served by personal delivery upon the Corporation, on the day so delivered (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) or (ii) if delivered by registered post or certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent to the Corporation by a national or international courier service, on the date of receipt by the Corporation (or, if such date of receipt is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), and in each case to the Corporation at the address set forth below, or at such other address as may thereafter be listed as the principal executive offices of the Corporation in the then most recently filed Form 10-K or Form 10-Q of the Corporation, or as may thereafter be posted on the Corporations website as the address for notices under this Replacement Capital Covenant:

No remedy other than Permitted Remedies will arise by the terms of such securities or related transaction agreements in favor of the holders of such securities as a result of the issuers failure to pay Distributions because of the Mandatory Trigger Provision or as a result of the issuers exercise of its right under an Optional Deferral Provision until Distributions have been deferred for one or more Distribution Periods that total together at least ten years.

(the "Underwriting Agreement")
March 20, 2008
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am an employee of American Electric Power Service Corporation, an affiliate of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (the "Company"), and have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with your agreement to purchase $315,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Debentures"), of the Company, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.  Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
I have examined (1) the Junior Subordinated Indenture dated as of March 1, 2008 (the "Indenture") as to be supplemented by a Company Order and Officers Certificate, each dated as of March 20, 2008 (collectively, the "Company Order"), from the Company to The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), (2) the Underwriting Agreement, (3) the Registration Statement and (4) the Prospectus.  In addition, I have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon the originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents or oral statements of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, and have made such other and further investigations as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions hereinafter set forth.
In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

(c)           The Company has full power and authority to execute and deliver the Company Order, and the Indenture and the Company Order have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization or other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and (ii) general equity principles, whether considered at equity or in a court of law.  The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
(d)           The Company has full power and authority to execute and deliver the Debentures and the Debentures have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming due authentication by the Trustee, constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization or other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and (ii) general equity principles, whether considered at equity or in a court of law.
(e)           The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued an appropriate order under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the sale of the Debentures.  No other approval or consent of any governmental body is required for the issuance and the sale of the Debentures to you or the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Company Order.  I have not considered whether any approval or consent is required under the blue sky laws of any jurisdiction.
I am today delivering an executed copy of this opinion to the Hunton & Williams LLP and & Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, who are entitled to rely upon this opinion to the same extent as if such opinion were addressed to them.  This opinion is rendered to you, the Trustee, Hunton & Williams LLP and Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, in connection with the above-described transaction.  This opinion may not be relied upon by you, the Trustee,
Hunton & Williams LLP and Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP for any other purpose, or relied upon or furnished to any other person, firm or corporation without my prior written permission.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to American Electric Power Company, Inc., a New York corporation (the Company), in connection with the offering and sale (the Offering) of $315,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.75% Junior Subordinated Debentures (the Debentures) of the Company pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated as of March 13, 2008 (the Prospectus Supplement) and a base prospectus dated as of June 9, 2005 (the Base Prospectus).  The Debentures are being issued pursuant to a Subordinated Indenture, dated as of March 1, 2008, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (as supplemented, the Indenture).  You have requested our opinion regarding certain United States (U.S.) federal income tax matters in connection with the Offering.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Indenture.
 
We have reviewed the originals or copies of (i) the Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, (ii) the Indenture and (iii) such other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth below.  For purposes of the opinion expressed below, we have assumed, with your permission, (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies, (iii) the genuineness of signatures not witnessed by us, (iv) the legal capacity of natural persons, (v) the due authorization, execution, and delivery of all documents by all parties thereto and the validity, binding effect, and enforceability thereof, and (vi) the compliance (without waiver) by all of the parties thereto with all of the provisions of the Indenture.  In addition, in providing our opinion herein, we have assumed, and have made no attempt to independently establish or verify, the accuracy of the facts set forth in such documents.
 
Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that the Debentures will constitute evidences of indebtedness and not equity interests in the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
There are no existing Treasury regulations under section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), defining instruments as equity or indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Furthermore, there are no controlling Treasury regulations, published rulings, or judicial decisions involving securities with terms substantially the same as the Debentures that discuss whether, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the securities constitute equity or indebtedness.  Therefore, our opinion regarding the characterization of the Debentures as evidences of indebtedness is based upon rulings and judicial decisions under the Code involving situations that we consider to be analogous and an analysis of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance and sale of the Debentures.
 
You should be aware that this opinion represents conclusions as to the application to the Debentures of existing law, Treasury regulations, administrative rules and practices, and legislative history.  There can be no assurance that existing law will not change or that contrary positions will not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service.
 
The foregoing opinion is limited to the U.S. federal tax matters addressed herein, and no other opinions are rendered with respect to other U.S. federal tax or other matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or any state or locality.  This opinion letter is rendered as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update the opinion expressed herein after the date of this letter.  This opinion letter is solely for the information and use of the addressees, and it may not be distributed, relied upon for any purpose by any other person, quoted in whole or in part or otherwise reproduced in any document, or filed with any governmental agency without our express written consent.
 
 
 
 
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WE INFORM YOU THAT (A) ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX ADVICE CONTAINED HEREIN WAS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX PENALTIES, (B) ANY SUCH ADVICE WAS WRITTEN TO SUPPORT THE PROMOTION OR MARKETING OF THE TRANSACTION OR MATTER ADDRESSED HEREIN AND (C) ANY INVESTOR TO WHOM THE TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ARE BEING PROMOTED, MARKETED OR RECOMMENDED SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.
 
Very truly yours,
/s/ Hunton & Williams LLP
