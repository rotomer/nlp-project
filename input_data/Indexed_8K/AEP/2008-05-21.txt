Item 7.01                      
Regulation FD Disclosure
Representatives of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (the Company) will be conducting meetings with investors during the period of May 21, 2008 through May 23, 2008.  The Company is giving notice of the fact that during the course of those meetings, the Company will reaffirm its prior guidance of on-going earnings of $3.10 to $3.30 per share for the 2008 fiscal year, as most recently stated in a Form 8-K the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 24, 2008 in connection with its frist quarter earnings press release.
AEPs management believes that the Companys ongoing earnings, or GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items as described in the press release, provide a more meaningful representation of the Companys performance.  AEP uses ongoing earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding its earnings outlook and results.  The Company also uses ongoing earnings data internally to measure performance against budget and to report to AEPs board of directors.
This report made by AEP contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Although AEP believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected.  Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are:
Electric load and customer growth; weather conditions, including storms; available sources and costs of, and transportation for, fuels and the creditworthiness of fuel suppliers and transporters; availability of generating capacity and the performance of AEPs generating plants; the ability to recover regulatory assets and stranded costs in connection with deregulation; the ability to recover increases in fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; the ability to build or acquire generating capacity when needed at acceptable prices and terms and to recover those costs through applicable rate cases; new legislation, litigation and government regulation including requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon and other substances; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions (including rate or other recovery for new investments, transmission service and environmental compliance); resolution of litigation (including pending Clean Air Act enforcement actions and disputes arising from the bankruptcy of Enron Corp.); AEPs ability to constrain its operation and maintenance costs; AEPs ability to sell assets at acceptable prices and on other acceptable terms, including rights to share in earnings derived from the assets subsequent to their sale; the economic climate and growth in its service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; inflationary trends; its ability to develop and execute a strategy based on a view regarding prices of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related commodities; changes in the creditworthiness and number of participants in the energy trading market; changes in the financial markets, particularly those affecting the availability of capital and AEPs ability to refinance existing debt at attractive rates; actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt; volatility and changes in markets for electricity, natural gas and other energy-related commodities; changes in utility
regulation, including membership and integration into regional transmission structures; accounting pronouncements periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies; the performance of AEPs pension and other postretirement benefit plans; prices for power that AEP generates and sells at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation and other risks and unforeseen events, including wars, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs), embargoes and other catastrophic events.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
