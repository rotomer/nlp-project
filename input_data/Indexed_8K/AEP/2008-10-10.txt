Item 2.03  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
As described further below, on October 8, 2008, American Electric Power Company, Inc (AEP) borrowed a total of approximately $1,400,000,000 under its existing credit facilities.  AEP took this proactive step to increase its cash position while there are disruptions in the debt markets. The borrowings provide AEP flexibility and will act as a bridge until the capital markets improve.
On October 8, 2008, AEP borrowed a total of approximately $700,000,000 under the $1,500,000,000 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated March 31, 2008 (the 2011 Credit Agreement), among AEP, as Borrower, the Lenders parties thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Commitments under the 2011 Credit Agreement expire on March 30, 2011.  This loan is a Base Rate Advance and bears interest at the Base Rate (as such terms are defined in the 2011 Credit Agreement), and is due and payable on March 30, 2011.  The total borrowings currently outstanding under the 2011 Credit Agreement is approximately $1,000,000,000.  All or a portion of these loans may be prepaid in advance of the due date.  Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2011 Credit Agreement, funds are available for borrowing under the facility through the day prior to the expiration date.
