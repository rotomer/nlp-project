Reference is made to page A-61 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2008 of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP), under the discussion subtitled Allocation of Off-system Sales Margins and page H-27 under the discussion subtitled Allocation of Off-system Sales MarginsAffecting APCo, CSPCo, I&M, OPCo, PSO and SWEPCo of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2008 of Appalachian Power Company (APCo), Columbus Power Company (CSPCo), Indiana Michigan Power Company (I&M), Ohio Power Company (OPCo), Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) and Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCo). Kentucky Power Company (KPCo), together with APCo, CSPCo, I&M and OPCo are referred to as the AEP East Companies. AEP Texas Central Company (TCC) and AEP Texas North Company (TNC), together with PSO and SWEPCo, are referred to as the AEP West Companies.  The following text updates and supplements that disclosure.
In an order issued November 26, 2008, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruled that AEP should reallocate pre-tax trading margins from off-system sales between the AEP East Companies and the AEP West Companies during the period from June 2000 to March 2006 under the System Integration Agreement.  The FERC also directed AEP to issue appropriate refunds, with accrued interest, within 30 days of the date of the FERC order to the AEP West Companies.
As a result of the FERC order and based on preliminary estimates, the AEP East Companies could be required to transfer to the AEP West Companies up to approximately $250 million. During the relevant period, the AEP West Companies were entitled to retain a portion of the off-system sales margins, and were required to share the remaining portion with their customers. The AEP West Companies would be entitled to retain up to approximately $99 million of those transferred amounts ($63 million after-tax). The AEP West Companies will make filings with their respective public service commissions to determine how the remaining approximate $151 million should be returned for the benefit of the ratepayers. AEP will seek a rehearing of this order at FERC.
The respective amounts that the AEP East Companies would transfer and the AEP West Companies would receive (and related earnings impact), and the consolidated impact on net income of AEP, are set forth in the table below.
