See discussions of Ohio rate matters beginning on pages A-78 and H-17 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.
On March 18, 2009, The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) issued an order that modified and approved Columbus Southern Power Companys (CSPCos) and Ohio Power Companys (OPCos) (collectively, the Companies) Electric Security Plans (ESPs) (the Order). If accepted by the Companies, the ESPs would be in effect through 2011.  The Order authorized increases to customers rates during the ESP period. The PUCO capped the overall bill increases, including the FAC referred to below, for CSPCo to 7% in 2009, 6% in 2010 and 6% in 2011, and for OPCo to 8% in 2009, 7% in 2010 and 8% in 2011. The Order provided that 2009 rates would be effective as of January 1, 2009, and that the Companies may, after final PUCO review and approval, collect the 2009 revenues over the remainder of 2009. These revenue percentage increases are projected to result in increased revenues of approximately $116 million, $109 million and $116 million for CSPCo and approximately $130 million, $125 million and $153 million for OPCo for the years ending December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.
The Order provides a fuel adjustment clause (FAC) for the three-year period of the ESP that allows the Companies to pass through to customers actual fuel costs incurred, along with purchased power and related expenses that will be trued-up, subject to the annual caps described above and to annual prudency and accounting review. The Order also allows the Companies to defer unrecovered fuel expenses resulting from the annual caps and to accrue carrying charges on such deferrals at the Companies weighted average cost of capital. Any deferred fuel balance at the end of the ESP period would be recovered through a non-bypassable surcharge over the period 2012 through 2018. The quarterly deferred FAC balances for 2009 are expected to be material.  The PUCO rejected a proposal by several intervenors to offset the FAC costs with a credit for off-system sales margins.
Additionally, the Order addressed several other items, including:
Finally, consistent with its decisions on ESP orders of other companies, the PUCO ordered that it will establish a proceeding to examine the methodology for the Significantly Excessive Earnings Test (SEET) that will be applicable to all electric utilities in Ohio. However, the PUCO decided that the Companies SEET would exclude off-system sales margins and FAC deferrals and related expenses.  The PUCOs review of the Companies 2009 earnings is not expected until the third quarter of 2010.
The Companies intend to file a motion requesting rehearing of certain elements of the Order, and the Companies also expect intervenors to file motions for rehearing.
 
 
 
 
This report made by AEP, CSPCo and OPCo contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Although AEP believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected.  Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: economic climate and growth in, or contraction within, AEP service territories and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; inflationary or deflationary interest rate trends; volatility in the financial markets, particularly developments affecting the availability of capital on reasonable terms and developments impairing the ability to finance new capital projects and refinance existing debt at attractive rates; the availability and cost of funds to finance working capital and capital needs, particularly during periods when the time lag between incurring costs and recovery is long and the costs are material; electric load and customer growth; weather conditions, including storms; available sources and costs of, and transportation for, fuels and the creditworthiness and performance of fuel suppliers and transporters; availability of generating capacity and the performance of AEP generating plants including the ability to restore Cook Plant Unit 1 in a timely manner; the ability to recover regulatory assets and stranded costs in connection with deregulation; the ability to recover increases in fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; the ability to build or acquire generating capacity and transmission line facilities (including the ability to obtain any necessary regulatory or siting approvals and permits) when needed at acceptable prices and terms and to recover those costs (including the costs of projects that are cancelled) through applicable rate cases or competitive rates; new legislation, litigation and government regulation including requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions (including rate or other recovery of new investments in generation, distribution and transmission service and environmental compliance); resolution of litigation (including disputes arising from the bankruptcy of Enron Corp. and related matters) the ability to constrain operation and maintenance costs; the ability to develop and execute a strategy based on a view regarding prices of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related commodities; changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties with whom AEP has contractual arrangements, including participants in the energy trading markets; actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt; volatility and changes in markets for electricity, natural gas, coal, nuclear fuel and other energy-related commodities; changes in utility regulation, including the implementation of the recently passed utility law in Ohio and the allocation of costs within RTOs, including PJM and SPP; accounting pronouncements periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies; the impact of volatility in the capital markets on the value of the investments held by the pension, other postretirement benefit plans and nuclear decommissioning trust and the impact on future funding requirements; prices for power to generate and sell at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation; other risks and unforeseen events, including wars, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs), embargoes and other catastrophic events.
