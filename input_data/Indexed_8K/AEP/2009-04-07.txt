WHEREAS, the Underwriters have designated the persons signing this Agreement (collectively, the Representative) to execute this Agreement on behalf of the respective Underwriters and to act for the respective Underwriters in the manner provided in this Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the Company has prepared and filed, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), a registration statement (File No. 333-156387), which was effective upon filing with the Commission, and a prospectus relating to, among other securities, its Common Stock; and
WHEREAS, such registration statement, including the financial statements, the documents incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference, and the exhibits thereto, being herein called, collectively, the Registration Statement, and the prospectus, including the documents incorporated or deemed incorporated therein by reference, constituting a part of such Registration Statement, as it may be last amended or supplemented prior to the effectiveness of this Agreement, but excluding any amendment or supplement relating solely to securities other than the Shares, being herein called the Basic Prospectus, and the Basic Prospectus, as amended and supplemented, including documents incorporated by reference therein, together with the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated March 30, 2009, immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below), being herein called the Pricing Prospectus, and the Basic Prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as it is to be supplemented by a final prospectus supplement (the Prospectus Supplement) to include information relating to the Shares, including the names of the Underwriters, the price and terms of the offering, and certain other information relating to the Shares, which will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Commission's General Rules and Regulations under the Act (the Rules), including all documents then incorporated or deemed to have been incorporated therein by reference, being herein called the Prospectus.
For purposes of this Agreement, the Applicable Time is 5:30 pm (New York Time) on the date of this Agreement and the documents and information listed in Exhibit 2, taken together, collectively being herein called the Pricing Disclosure Package.

8.           :
Indemnification and Contribution
(a)
 
To the extent permitted by law, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold each Underwriter harmless, each Underwriters employees, agents, officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which an Underwriter, they or any of you or them may become subject under the Act or otherwise, and to reimburse the Underwriters, they or any of you or them, for any legal or other expenses incurred by you or them in connection with defending any action, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any alleged untrue statement or untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, in the Basic Prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of this Agreement), in the Pricing Prospectus, in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) or in the Prospectus, or if the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Underwriters any amendments or any supplements to the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented except to the extent that such amendments or supplements relate solely to securities other than the Shares (provided that if such Prospectus or such Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, is used after the period of time referred to in Section 4(b) hereof, it shall contain such amendments or supplements as the Company deems necessary to comply with Section 10(a) of the Act), or arise out of or are based upon any alleged omission or omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any such alleged untrue statement or omission, or untrue statement or omission which was made in the Registration Statement, in the Basic Prospectus, in the Pricing Prospectus, in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, in any issuer free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 433 under the Act) or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or through the Representative expressly for use therein.  Each Underwriter agrees promptly after its receipt of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from the Company on account of its agreement contained in this Section 8(a) may be sought by any such Underwriter, or by any person controlling any such Underwriter, to notify the Company in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the Company of any such action shall not release the Company from any liability which it may have to an Underwriter or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(a).  In case any such action shall be brought against an Underwriter or any such controlling person and an Underwriter shall notify the Company of the commencement thereof, as above provided, the Company shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, including the selection of counsel (such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party), to direct the defense thereof at its own expense.  In case the Company elects to direct such defense and select such counsel (hereinafter, Companys counsel), an Underwriter or any controlling person shall have the right to employ its own counsel, but, in any such case, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at such Underwriters or controlling persons expense unless (i) the Company has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both an Underwriter or any controlling person and the Company and such Underwriter or any controlling person shall have been advised by its counsel that a conflict of interest between the Company and such Underwriter or any controlling person may arise (and the Companys counsel shall have concurred in good faith with such advice) and for this reason it is not desirable for the Companys counsel to represent both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for the Underwriters or any controlling person (plus any local counsel retained by the Underwriters or any controlling person in their reasonable judgment), which firm (or firms) shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters or any controlling person).
(b)
 
Each Underwriter agrees, to the extent permitted by law, severally and not jointly, to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the Company, its directors and such of its officers as shall have signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, to the same extent and upon the same terms as the indemnity agreement of the Company set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only with respect to untrue statements or alleged untrue statements or omissions or alleged omissions made in the Registration Statement, or in the Basic Prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of this Agreement), or in the Pricing Prospectus, or in any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, or in the Prospectus, or in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the Representative on behalf of such Underwriter expressly for use therein.  The Company agrees promptly after the receipt by it of written notice of the commencement of any action in respect to which indemnity from you on account of your agreement contained in this Section 8(b) may be sought by the Company, or by any person controlling the Company, to notify you in writing of the commencement thereof, but the Companys omission so to notify you of any such action shall not release you from any liability which you may have to the Company or to such controlling person otherwise than on account of the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(b).
(c)
 
If recovery is not available or insufficient to hold the indemnified party harmless under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof for any reason other than as specified therein, the indemnified party shall be entitled to contribution for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses for which such indemnification is so unavailable or insufficient under this Section 8(c).  In determining the amount of contribution to which such indemnified party is entitled, there shall be considered the portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Shares realized by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand, the relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, and any equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) without reference to the considerations called for in the previous sentence.  No Underwriter or any person controlling such Underwriter shall be obligated to contribute any amount or amounts hereunder which in the aggregate exceeds the total price of the Shares purchased by such Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages which such Underwriter and its controlling persons have otherwise been required to pay in respect of the same claim or any substantially similar claim.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  An Underwriters obligation to contribute under this Section 8 is in proportion to its purchase obligation and not joint with any other Underwriter.
(d)
 
No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the   indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.
(e)
 
In no event shall any indemnifying party have any liability or responsibility in respect of the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim effected without its prior written consent.
The agreements contained in this Section 8 hereof shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any person, and shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Shares hereunder.
9.           :  If any Underwriter under this Agreement shall fail or refuse (otherwise than for some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, the cancellation or termination of its obligations hereunder) to purchase and pay for the number of Shares which it has agreed to purchase and pay for hereunder, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions which the amounts of Shares set forth opposite their names in Exhibit 1 hereto bear to the aggregate number of Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein; provided that in no event shall the number of Shares which any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to Section 1 hereof be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter.  In the event of any such purchase, (a) the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company shall have the right to fix as a postponed Closing Time a date not exceeding four full business days after the date specified in Section 2 and (b) the respective number of Shares to be purchased by the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be taken as the basis of their respective underwriting obligations for all purposes of this Agreement.  If any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter; provided, however, that the non-defaulting Underwriters may agree, in their sole discretion, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the terms set forth herein.  In the event of any such termination, the Company shall not be under any liability to any Underwriter (except to the extent, if any, provided in Section 4(i) hereof), nor shall any Underwriter (other than an Underwriter who shall have failed or refused to purchase the Shares without some reason sufficient to justify, in accordance with the terms hereof, its termination of its obligations hereunder) be under any liability to the Company or any other Underwriter.
Default of Underwriters
Nothing herein contained shall release any defaulting Underwriter from its liability to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
10.           :  This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Time by the Representative if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Time, in the Representative reasonable judgment, the Underwriters ability to market the Shares shall have been materially adversely affected because:
Termination of Agreement by the Underwriters
If the Representative elects to terminate this Agreement, as provided in this Section 10, the Representative will promptly notify the Company by telephone or by telex or facsimile transmission, confirmed in writing.  If this Agreement shall not be carried out by any Underwriter for any reason permitted hereunder, or if the sale of the Shares to the Underwriters as herein contemplated shall not be carried out because the Company is not able to comply with the terms hereof, the Company shall not be under any obligation under this Agreement and shall not be liable to any Underwriter or to any member of any selling group for the loss of anticipated profits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company shall remain liable to the extent provided in Sections 4(h), 4(i) and 8 hereof) and the Underwriters shall be under no liability to the Company nor be under any liability under this Agreement to one another.
11.           :  All notices hereunder shall, unless otherwise expressly provided, be in writing and be delivered at or mailed to the following addresses or by telex or facsimile transmission confirmed in writing to the following addresses:  if to the Underwriters, to the Representative at J.P.

Re: Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-
156387
)
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am an employee of American Electric Power Service Corporation, an affiliate of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (the Company), and have acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the above-referenced Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration Statement No. 333-156387 (the Registration Statement)), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), relating to, among other things, 69,000,000 shares of Companys Common Stock, $6.50 par value (the Shares).
 
In connection with the foregoing, I have examined (i) the Registration Statement including a base prospectus dated December 22, 2008, (ii) the prospectus supplement, dated April 1, 2009, (iii) a copy of the executed Underwriting Agreement dated April 1, 2009, among the Company and the several underwriters named therein (the Underwriting Agreement), (iv) a certificate of the Assistant Secretary of the Company, to which are attached: (A) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, (B) the Bylaws of the Company, and (C) resolutions of the Company with respect to the subject transactions, and (v) a good standing certificate of the Company issued by the Secretary of State of the State of New York on April 3, 2009 (the Good Standing Certificate). For purposes of the opinions expressed below, I have assumed (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals thereof, (iii) the legal capacity of natural persons, (iv) the genuineness of signatures and (v) the due authorization, execution and delivery of all documents by all parties and the validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof (other than the authorization, execution and delivery of documents by the Company and the validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof upon the Company).
 
As to factual matters, I have relied upon representations in the Underwriting Agreement, upon certificates of officers of the Company, and upon certificates of public officials.
 
Based upon the foregoing and such other information and documents as I have considered necessary for the purposes hereof, I am of the opinion that:
 
 
 
I do not purport to express an opinion on any laws other than those of the State of New York. The opinion expressed in this letter speaks only as of its date, and nothing should be interpreted or construed to express or imply any opinion concerning the effect of any future events or actions. In regard to my opinion set forth in paragraph 1 above, I am relying without independent investigation solely on my review and examination of the Good Standing Certificate. I undertake no obligation to advise you as a result of developments occurring after the date hereof including changes in such laws or interpretations thereof, or as a result of facts or circumstances brought to my attention after the date hereof.
 
I hereby consent to filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 7, 2009, which is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
 
 
Very truly yours,
