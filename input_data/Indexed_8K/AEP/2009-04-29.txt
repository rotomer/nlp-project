At the Companys annual meeting on April 28, 2009, the Companys shareholders approved an amendment to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the cumulative voting provision of Article 4.2 from the Certificate of Incorporation.  In connection with this action, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's By-Laws, effective as of April 28, 2009, adding provisions requiring that, in order to be elected in an uncontested election, a nominee for director must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders, provide that, in contested elections, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast will be required to elect a director.  These provisions also require an incumbent director who fails to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election at a meeting of shareholders to submit his or her resignation, with such resignation to be considered by the members of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors, in each case excluding the affected incumbent director from participating in the consideration and decision. The decision of the Board of Directors as to whether or not to accept the resignation will be publicly disclosed, together with the reasons for such decision, within 90 days from the certification of the election results.
            The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation, a copy of which is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 3.1 to this Form 8-K, and the Amendment to the By-Laws, a copy of which is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit 3.2 to this Form 8-K.

A newSection 17 is added to the By-Laws of the Company as follows:
 
Section 17.  Each holder of common stock shall have one vote for every share of common stock entitled to vote which is registered in his or her name on the record date for the meeting.  In cases where the number of nominees is less than or equal to the number of directors to be elected, each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.  For purposes of this Section 17, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast for a directors election exceeds 50% of the total number of votes cast with respect to that directors election.  Votes cast shall include votes for, against or to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that directors election.  In cases where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.
If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected at a meeting of stockholders and no successor has been elected at the meeting, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors promptly after the certification of the election results by the inspector of elections.  The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether or not to accept the tendered resignation.  The Board of Directors shall make the decision whether or not to accept the tendered resignation, taking into account the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governances recommendation.  The Boards decision about the tendered resignation, and the rationale behind the decision, shall be disclosed in a public announcement within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results by the inspector of elections.  The Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making the decision, may consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant.  The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance or the decision of the Board of Directors about his or her resignation.  If the incumbent directors resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal.  If a directors resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this By-Law, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.
