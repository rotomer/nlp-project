Item 8.01  Other Events
 
On May 13, 2010, the Supreme Court of Arkansas reversed and remanded the decision of the Arkansas Public Service Commission (the Commission) to grant the Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need (the Certificate) to build the John R. Turk Plant (the Plant) in southwest Arkansas.  Southwestern Electric Power Company (the Company) is building the Plant and holds a 73% ownership interest in the planned 600MW coal-fired generating facility.  The Company sought the Certificate to serve its Arkansas retail ratepayers.  The Company also sought and received certificates from the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas to serve its retail customers in Louisiana and Texas.
 
In June 2006, the Commission approved the Companys application to establish that it needed additional power supply sources.  In a separate proceeding, the Commission approved the Companys application for the Certificate in November 2007.
 
In its decision, the Supreme Court held that Arkansas law requires that the determination of whether the Company has demonstrated the need for additional power supply sources and whether the conditions to issue the Certificate have been met must be evaluated in a single proceeding.  The Court ruled that the Commission erred in determining the need for additional power supply sources in a proceeding separate from its granting of the Certificate.  The Court also ruled that the Commissions order approving the need for additional power supply sources was not supported by substantial evidence.
 
Separately, the Court approved the Commissions consideration of the Certificate for the Plant in a proceeding separate from proceedings to consider certificates for the transmission facilities needed to serve the Plant.
 
The Company is studying the decision and evaluating its next actions with respect to the Plant.
