Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
Reference is made to pages 32 and 33 under the caption CSPCo and OPCo Rate Matters in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Rate Matters in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 for American Electric Power Company, Inc., Columbus Southern Power Company and Ohio Power Company (collectively, AEP).  On May 4, 2011, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) directed AEP to file proposed revised tariffs by May 11, 2011 to remove provider of last resort (POLR) charges and certain environmental carrying costs. The PUCO issued its decision in response to its receipt of a remand from the Ohio Supreme Court that required it to reexamine parts of AEPs electric security plan. AEP estimates the amount of recovery associated with these issues for the period of June 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 equals approximately $57 million for Columbus Southern Power Company and approximately $58 million for Ohio Power Company.
In March 2009, the PUCO approved AEPs electric security plan that allowed AEP to recover incremental carrying costs on past environmental investments and a POLR charge to customers through the end of 2011.
On May 6, 2011, AEP filed a motion for rehearing with the PUCO. The motion asserts that the appropriate process for implementing the Ohio Supreme Court's decision is for the PUCO to conduct a remand proceeding before making any prospective rate changes. If the PUCO is unable to evaluate and decide the remand issues before the first billing cycle of June 2011 (or the PUCO decides it is necessary to conduct further proceedings such as an evidentiary hearing or additional briefing), the motion alternatively requests that the rates in dispute be collected subject to refund based on the final outcome of the remand proceeding.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
