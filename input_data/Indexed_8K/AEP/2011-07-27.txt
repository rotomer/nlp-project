 On July 26, 2011, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) terminated its $1,500,000,000 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2008, among AEP, the Lenders party thereto, the LC Issuing Banks named therein and Barclays Bank PLC, as Administrative Agent.
   
 
 On July 26, 2011, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) entered into a $1,750,000,000 5-Year Credit Agreement, dated July 26, 2011, among AEP, the Initial Lenders named therein, the Swingline Bank party thereto, the LC Issuing Banks party thereto, and Barclays  Bank PLC, as Administrative Agent.  This Credit Agreement replaces the $1,500,000,000 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2008, among AEP, the Lenders party thereto, the LC Issuing Banks named therein and Barclays Bank PLC, as Administrative Agent.
   
 
 Additionally, on July 26, 2011, AEP entered into a $1,500,000,000 4-Year Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated July 26, 2011, among AEP, the Initial Lenders named therein, the Swingline Bank party thereto, the LC Issuing Banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.  This Credit Agreement amends and restates the $1,500,000,000 3-Year Credit Agreement, dated June 23, 2010. among AEP, the Initial Lenders named therein, the Swingline Bank party thereto, the LC Issuing Banks party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
   
 Borrowings and letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreements are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type.  The Credit Agreements contain certain covenants and require AEP to maintain its percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%.  The method for calculating outstanding debt and other capital is contractually defined in the Credit Agreements. 
   
Nonperformance by AEP of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreements.  The acceleration of AEPs payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its respective subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million would cause an event of default under the Credit Agreements and permit the lenders to declare AEPs outstanding amounts payable.  The Credit Agreements do not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on either facility if a material adverse change occurs.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
