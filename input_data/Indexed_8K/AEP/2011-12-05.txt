Other Events
Reference is made to pages 45 and 46 under the caption Texas Restructuring Appeals in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements entitled Rate Matters in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 for American Electric Power Company, Inc (AEP).   On December 2, 2011, AEP Texas Central Company (TCC) filed a settlement with the parties to its true-up remand proceeding at the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT).  The agreement would allow TCC to securitize a true-up balance of $800 million.  In addition, the agreement would allow TCC to retain certain income tax balances which would favorably affect net income.  The settlement resolves all claims in TCC's true-up remand along with pending excess earnings refund claims and is subject to approval by the PUCT.  The PUCT is expected to consider the settlement at its December 15, 2011 open meeting.  TCC also filed its request for a financing order necessary to authorize the issuance of transition bonds.  However, the timing for, and actual completion of, any transition bond offering will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including actions by the PUCT, the timing for approval of a financing order and any appeals thereof, and future market conditions.
