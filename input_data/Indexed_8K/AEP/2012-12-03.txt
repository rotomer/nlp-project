12
 
governmental charge payable in relation thereto.

If any Interest Payment Date, any redemption date or Stated Maturity is not a Business Day, then payment of the amounts due on this Note on such date will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on such amounts for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, redemption date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, with the same force and effect as if made on such date.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of the Holders of the Notes of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Notes of such series.  Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
