EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        ARLINGTON, VA, August 21, 2002The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) confirmed today that pursuant to the terms of the AES Drax Senior Loan Documents ("Senior Loan Documents"), its subsidiary, AES Drax Holdings, cannot make a distribution needed to pay the interest due on August 30, 2002, to the AES Drax Energy note holders. On August 20, 2002, ratios were calculated pursuant to the Senior Loan Documents. These ratios are insufficient to permit a distribution to AES Drax Energy, the issuer of two series of senior secured notes due 2010. The two series affected consist of the GBP 135 million and the USD 200 million issues, bearing coupon rates of 11.25% and 11.50%, respectively. AES Drax Energy currently has insufficient cash to make the approximately GBP 15 million interest payment due on August 30, 2002. The AES Drax Energy debt service reserve account is currently funded with approximately GBP 7 million, resulting in an approximate shortfall of GBP 8 million. AES intends to fund its subsidiary to cover the shortfall in the August 30 interest payment; however, there can be no assurance that AES will continue to provide funding for future interest payments.
