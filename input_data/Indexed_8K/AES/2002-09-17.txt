On September 12, 2002 subsidiaries of AES (AES Greystone , LLC and its subsidiary Haywood Power I, LLC) sold the Greystone gas-fired peaker assets currently under construction in Haywood County, Tennessee to Tenaska Power Equipment, LLC. for $36 million including cash and assumption of certain obligations. With this sale, AES and its subsidiaries have eliminated any future capital expenditures related to the facility, and also settled all major outstanding obligations with parties involved in this project. The decision to sell the assets under construction was due in part to the changed economic circumstances related to forward power prices as well as AES's effort to reduce capital spending. AES will record an after tax charge of approximately $100 million associated with this sale, which will be classified as discontinued operations.
