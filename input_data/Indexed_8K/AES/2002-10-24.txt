The Company has recorded the retroactive regulatory decision by the Brazilian regulator depriving AES Sul of amounts the Company believes it was entitled to receive as a reduction in revenue. Pro forma revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, approximate $6.7 billion.
        AES's business segments, which include Contract Generation, Large Utilities, Competitive Supply and Growth Distribution generated combined income before income taxes (EBT) of $257 million for the third quarter of 2002 as compared to $359 million during the same period last year. On a geographic basis, EBT for the third quarter of 2002 was generated 71% from North America, 6% from South America, 6% from the Caribbean, 11% from Asia and 6% from Europe and Africa.
Contract Generation
        Contract Generation consists of our power plants located around the world that have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks (primarily electricity prices) for a period of at least five years and for 75% or more of their expected output capacity.
        For the third quarter of 2002, Contract Generation revenues were $611 million and represented 29% of total revenues for the quarter, an increase of $21 million over 2001. The most significant contributions continued to be from North and South America, which in aggregate comprised 61% of Contract Generation revenue for the quarter as compared to 63% for the third quarter of 2001. Revenues were enhanced with the addition of recently completed contract generation businesses totaling 1,537 mw (added subsequent to the third quarter of 2001), including Ironwood in Pennsylvania (705 mw natural gas) and Red Oak in New Jersey (832 mw natural gas). Revenues also improved at Warrior Run in Maryland, Shady Point in Oklahoma, Tiszai in Hungary, Ebute in Nigeria, Los Mina in the Dominican Republic and Ecogen in Australia. These improvements were offset by declines at Uruguaiana and Tiete in Brazil, the Gener plants in Chile, Southland and Mendota in California, Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan and Haripur in Bangladesh.
        The operating margin (as a percentage of revenues) for our Contract Generation segment showed significant improvement over the third quarter of 2001 at 40% for the third quarter of 2002 as compared to 26% for the third quarter of 2001. Stronger margins and margin percentages arose during the quarter at most contract generation plants in South America, North America, Europe and Africa, with the most significant improvements at Tiete and Uruguaiana in Brazil (due to the discontinuance of electricity rationing in 2002), Warrior Run, Ironwood and Red Oak in the U.S., Kilroot in Northern Ireland, Tiszai in Hungary and Ebute in Nigeria. These improvements were partially offset by declines at Southland and Mendota in California, Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan and Haripur in Bangladesh.
        As a result, Contract Generation delivered $142 million of EBT (or 55% of the total) for the third quarter of 2002, an increase of 89% over the third quarter of 2001 EBT of $75 million (21% of the total). All geographic regions showed increases in EBT within the contract generation segment except for the Caribbean and Asia.
Competitive Supply
        Competitive Supply consists primarily of our power plants selling electricity directly to wholesale customers in competitive markets and as a result the profitability of such plants are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal, in particular. During the third quarter, AES completed the sale of NewEnergy, a competitive retail supply business for approximately $260 million. As a result of the sale, NewEnergy's results are included in the income statement for both 2001 and 2002 periods as a discontinued operation and are therefore excluded from the discussion below.
        For the third quarter of 2002, revenues for this segment were $437 million and represented 20% of total revenues for the quarter. The most significant contributions continued to be from the competitive markets of the UK and the U.S. that in aggregate comprised 73% of Competitive Supply revenue for the quarter. Competitive market prices declined year over year in Argentina due to the devaluation of the Peso in January 2002 and prices were also lower in California and the UK compared to 2001 and as a result total revenue for the competitive supply segment decreased 15% from the third quarter of 2001. Certain plants showed offsetting revenue improvements including Tiszapalkonya in Hungary and Chivor in Colombia. Year on year increases associated with new businesses in 2002 included Parana in Argentina (845 mw gas) and Delano in California (50 mw gas).
        The operating margin (as a percentage of revenues) for our Competitive Supply segment was 22% in the third quarter of 2002, a decrease from 25% in the third quarter of 2001. Improvements in margin and margin percentages were most significant at San Nicolas in Argentina due to export contracts that include a fixed capacity payment in U.S. Dollars, at Deepwater in Texas, Tiszapalkonya and Borsod in Hungary, and in the Caribbean region at Chivor in Colombia and at Panama. These improvements were offset by lower margins at Alicura in Argentina, the New York plants, Whitefield in New Hampshire, Barry and Drax in the UK, and most significantly by margin reductions at Placerita in California which operated minimally during the third quarter of 2002 due to lower prices in California. Overall, operating margin for competitive supply declined 22% to $98 million for the third quarter of 2002.
        As a result of lower competitive prices, primarily in California and the UK, Competitive Supply generated $29 million of EBT (or 11% of the total) for the third quarter of 2002, a decrease from the 2001 third quarter EBT of $83 million.
Large Utilities
        The Large Utilities segment is comprised of our four large integrated utilities that serve nearly 11 million customers in North America, the Caribbean and South America. Businesses include IPALCO in Indiana, EDC in Venezuela along with CEMIG (an equity affiliate) and Eletropaulo in Brazil. During the second quarter of 2002, AES announced the sale of CILCO, a large utility business serving Central Illinois, for an enterprise value of approximately $1.4 billion. As a result of the pending sale, CILCO's results are included in the income statement for both 2001 and 2002 periods as a discontinued operation and are therefore excluded from the discussion below.
        For the third quarter of 2002, revenues for this segment were $781 million and represented 37% of total revenues for the quarter. The significant increase in revenues of 84% resulted primarily from consolidating the results of Eletropaulo (serving Sao Paulo, Brazil) beginning in February 2002 when AES acquired control of that business with a 68% voting interest (increased from 49% prior to that date when Eletropaulo was treated as an equity affiliate). Additional revenues from Eletropaulo of $416 million were aided by a slight increase in revenue at IPALCO and offset by a 31% decrease in revenues at EDC to $138 million primarily due to the devaluation of the Bolivar during 2002.
        The operating margin was $200 million for the quarter, an increase of 29% over 2001 due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo and an improvement in the operating margin at IPALCO. These increases were offset by a decline in the operating margin at EDC. As a percentage of sales the operating margin for large utilities was 26%, down from 37% for the third quarter of 2001 because of reductions in margin at EDC resulting in part from the devaluation of the Bolivar as well as lower than average segment margins at Eletropaulo during the third quarter of 2002 because of slower than anticipated recovery of electricity demand from the effects of rationing in Brazil that ended in March 2002.
        Large Utilities generated $87 million of EBT (or 34% of the total) for the third quarter of 2002, down from the third quarter EBT for 2001 of $203 million (or 56%). The reduction in third quarter 2002 results primarily from reduced contributions (after associated interest costs) from Eletropaulo and EDC because of the factors discussed above.
Growth Distribution
        Our Growth Distribution segment, serving over 5 million customers, consists of electricity distribution companies that are generally located in developing countries or regions where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate higher than in more developed regions.
        For the third quarter of 2002, revenues were $308 million and represented 14% of total revenues for the quarter. The Caribbean represents the most significant contributor representing 45% of growth distribution revenues, while South America represents 29% and Europe and Africa contributing the remaining 26% for the quarter.
        Growth Distribution revenues increased at Ede Este in the Dominican Republic, Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in Ukraine as well as at Sonel in Cameroon. These increases were offset by significant reductions in Argentina because of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, reductions at Sul because of the devaluation during the quarter of the Brazilian Real, reductions in revenues at our El Salvador distribution businesses and the change to reflect Cesco in India as an equity affiliate in the third quarter of 2001.
        The operating margin was $48 million or 16% of revenues as compared with $49 million and 15% of revenues for the third quarter of 2001. Margins improved at Sul in Brazil, Sonel in Cameroon, Telasi in Georgia, Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in the Ukraine and Ede Este in the Dominican Republic. Despite the reductions in revenue and operating margin arising from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso during 2002, the margin percentages in the Argentine distribution businesses improved slightly as compared to the third quarter of 2001.
        As a result, Growth Distribution was break even for the third quarter of 2002, a slight increase from EBT of $(2) million in the third quarter of 2001.

ARLINGTON, VA, October 24, 2002
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported earnings from recurring operations of $92 million, or 17 cents per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2002, down 39% from $151 million, or 28 cents per share, in the year earlier quarter. Earnings from recurring operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, were $410 million, or 76 cents per share, down 26% from $557 million, or $1.03 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2001. Revenues for the third quarter were $2.1 billion, up 16% percent from a year earlier.
        After adjusting for non-cash charges and discontinued business operations, AES reported a GAAP loss for the third quarter of $(314) million, or (58) cents per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, the GAAP loss was $(743) million, or $(1.38) per share. The GAAP loss for the third quarter of 2002 includes $(215) million, or (40) cents per share, from discontinued operations.
        Parent operating cash flow was $1.24 billion for the twelve months ended September 30, 2002 and $252 million for the third quarter of 2002. Parent company liquidity at September 30, 2002, stood at $395 million.
        "This has been a challenging time for AES and others in our industry. We are intensely focused on managing cash flow and liquidity as we work on solutions to near term challenges. At the same time, we remain committed to strengthening AES for the longer term through various initiatives to improve business performance," said President and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Hanrahan. "As a result of these efforts, we have begun to see improvements in the operating margins in many of our businesses, especially in the contract generation business line." Mr. Hanrahan continued, "We have also made good progress on asset sales. In September we completed the sale of AES NewEnergy ahead of schedule for approximately $260 million, and we expect to close the sale of Cilcorp by the end of the first quarter of 2003 and to realize approximately $500 million in cash."
        Barry Sharp, Chief Financial Officer, added, "This quarter we have also launched an exchange offer for our 2002 and 2003 notes as well as a new multi-tranche $1.6 billion senior secured credit facility. This is an extremely important transaction for AES as it will help address our near term
liquidity issues, permitting the company to establish a more manageable debt maturity schedule over the next several years, as well as providing the flexibility to delever and strengthen the balance sheet."

(4)
The Company has recorded the retroactive regulatory decision by the Brazilian regulator depriving AES Sul of amounts the Company believes it was entitled to receive as a reduction in revenue. Pro forma revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, approximate $6.7 billion.
        AES's business segments, which include Contract Generation, Large Utilities, Competitive Supply and Growth Distribution generated combined income before income taxes (EBT) of $257 million for the third quarter of 2002 as compared to $359 million during the same period last year. On a geographic basis, EBT for the third quarter of 2002 was generated 71% from North America, 6% from South America, 6% from the Caribbean, 11% from Asia and 6% from Europe and Africa.
Contract Generation
        Contract Generation consists of our power plants located around the world that have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks (primarily electricity prices) for a period of at least five years and for 75% or more of their expected output capacity.
        For the third quarter of 2002, Contract Generation revenues were $611 million and represented 29% of total revenues for the quarter, an increase of $21 million over 2001. The most significant contributions continued to be from North and South America, which in aggregate comprised 61% of Contract Generation revenue for the quarter as compared to 63% for the third quarter of 2001. Revenues were enhanced with the addition of recently completed contract generation businesses totaling 1,537 mw (added subsequent to the third quarter of 2001), including Ironwood in Pennsylvania (705 mw natural gas) and Red Oak in New Jersey (832 mw natural gas). Revenues also improved at Warrior Run in Maryland, Shady Point in Oklahoma, Tiszai in Hungary, Ebute in Nigeria, Los Mina in the Dominican Republic and Ecogen in Australia. These improvements were offset by declines at Uruguaiana and Tiete in Brazil, the Gener plants in Chile, Southland and Mendota in California, Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan and Haripur in Bangladesh.
        The operating margin (as a percentage of revenues) for our Contract Generation segment showed significant improvement over the third quarter of 2001 at 40% for the third quarter of 2002 as compared to 26% for the third quarter of 2001. Stronger margins and margin percentages arose during the quarter at most contract generation plants in South America, North America, Europe and Africa, with the most significant improvements at Tiete and Uruguaiana in Brazil (due to the discontinuance of electricity rationing in 2002), Warrior Run, Ironwood and Red Oak in the U.S., Kilroot in Northern Ireland, Tiszai in Hungary and Ebute in Nigeria. These improvements were partially offset by declines at Southland and Mendota in California, Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan and Haripur in Bangladesh.
        As a result, Contract Generation delivered $142 million of EBT (or 55% of the total) for the third quarter of 2002, an increase of 89% over the third quarter of 2001 EBT of $75 million (21% of the total). All geographic regions showed increases in EBT within the contract generation segment except for the Caribbean and Asia.
Competitive Supply
        Competitive Supply consists primarily of our power plants selling electricity directly to wholesale customers in competitive markets and as a result the profitability of such plants are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal, in particular. During the third quarter, AES completed the sale of NewEnergy, a competitive retail supply business for approximately $260 million. As a result of the sale, NewEnergy's results are included in the income statement for both 2001 and 2002 periods as a discontinued operation and are therefore excluded from the discussion below.
        For the third quarter of 2002, revenues for this segment were $437 million and represented 20% of total revenues for the quarter. The most significant contributions continued to be from the competitive markets of the UK and the U.S. that in aggregate comprised 73% of Competitive Supply revenue for the quarter. Competitive market prices declined year over year in Argentina due to the devaluation of the Peso in January 2002 and prices were also lower in California and the UK compared to 2001 and as a result total revenue for the competitive supply segment decreased 15% from the third quarter of 2001. Certain plants showed offsetting revenue improvements including Tiszapalkonya in Hungary and Chivor in Colombia. Year on year increases associated with new businesses in 2002 included Parana in Argentina (845 mw gas) and Delano in California (50 mw gas).
        The operating margin (as a percentage of revenues) for our Competitive Supply segment was 22% in the third quarter of 2002, a decrease from 25% in the third quarter of 2001. Improvements in margin and margin percentages were most significant at San Nicolas in Argentina due to export contracts that include a fixed capacity payment in U.S. Dollars, at Deepwater in Texas, Tiszapalkonya and Borsod in Hungary, and in the Caribbean region at Chivor in Colombia and at Panama. These improvements were offset by lower margins at Alicura in Argentina, the New York plants, Whitefield in New Hampshire, Barry and Drax in the UK, and most significantly by margin reductions at Placerita in California which operated minimally during the third quarter of 2002 due to lower prices in California. Overall, operating margin for competitive supply declined 22% to $98 million for the third quarter of 2002.
        As a result of lower competitive prices, primarily in California and the UK, Competitive Supply generated $29 million of EBT (or 11% of the total) for the third quarter of 2002, a decrease from the 2001 third quarter EBT of $83 million.
Large Utilities
        The Large Utilities segment is comprised of our four large integrated utilities that serve nearly 11 million customers in North America, the Caribbean and South America. Businesses include IPALCO in Indiana, EDC in Venezuela along with CEMIG (an equity affiliate) and Eletropaulo in Brazil. During the second quarter of 2002, AES announced the sale of CILCO, a large utility business serving Central Illinois, for an enterprise value of approximately $1.4 billion. As a result of the pending sale, CILCO's results are included in the income statement for both 2001 and 2002 periods as a discontinued operation and are therefore excluded from the discussion below.
        For the third quarter of 2002, revenues for this segment were $781 million and represented 37% of total revenues for the quarter. The significant increase in revenues of 84% resulted primarily from consolidating the results of Eletropaulo (serving Sao Paulo, Brazil) beginning in February 2002 when AES acquired control of that business with a 68% voting interest (increased from 49% prior to that date when Eletropaulo was treated as an equity affiliate). Additional revenues from Eletropaulo of $416 million were aided by a slight increase in revenue at IPALCO and offset by a 31% decrease in revenues at EDC to $138 million primarily due to the devaluation of the Bolivar during 2002.
        The operating margin was $200 million for the quarter, an increase of 29% over 2001 due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo and an improvement in the operating margin at IPALCO. These increases were offset by a decline in the operating margin at EDC. As a percentage of sales the operating margin for large utilities was 26%, down from 37% for the third quarter of 2001 because of reductions in margin at EDC resulting in part from the devaluation of the Bolivar as well as lower than average segment margins at Eletropaulo during the third quarter of 2002 because of slower than anticipated recovery of electricity demand from the effects of rationing in Brazil that ended in March 2002.
        Large Utilities generated $87 million of EBT (or 34% of the total) for the third quarter of 2002, down from the third quarter EBT for 2001 of $203 million (or 56%). The reduction in third quarter 2002 results primarily from reduced contributions (after associated interest costs) from Eletropaulo and EDC because of the factors discussed above.
Growth Distribution
        Our Growth Distribution segment, serving over 5 million customers, consists of electricity distribution companies that are generally located in developing countries or regions where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate higher than in more developed regions.
        For the third quarter of 2002, revenues were $308 million and represented 14% of total revenues for the quarter. The Caribbean represents the most significant contributor representing 45% of growth distribution revenues, while South America represents 29% and Europe and Africa contributing the remaining 26% for the quarter.
        Growth Distribution revenues increased at Ede Este in the Dominican Republic, Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in Ukraine as well as at Sonel in Cameroon. These increases were offset by significant reductions in Argentina because of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, reductions at Sul because of the devaluation during the quarter of the Brazilian Real, reductions in revenues at our El Salvador distribution businesses and the change to reflect Cesco in India as an equity affiliate in the third quarter of 2001.
        The operating margin was $48 million or 16% of revenues as compared with $49 million and 15% of revenues for the third quarter of 2001. Margins improved at Sul in Brazil, Sonel in Cameroon, Telasi in Georgia, Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in the Ukraine and Ede Este in the Dominican Republic. Despite the reductions in revenue and operating margin arising from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso during 2002, the margin percentages in the Argentine distribution businesses improved slightly as compared to the third quarter of 2001.
        As a result, Growth Distribution was break even for the third quarter of 2002, a slight increase from EBT of $(2) million in the third quarter of 2001.
