Business Segment Results AES's business segments, which include Contract Generation, Large Utilities, Competitive Supply and Growth Distribution generated combined income before income taxes (EBT) of $1.169 billion for 2002 as compared to $1.574 billion for 2001. On a geographic basis, EBT for 2002 was generated 50% from North America, 14% from Europe and Africa, 13% from South America, 12% from Asia and 11% from the Caribbean. Businesses that were sold or that were classified as discontinued operations during 2002 are excluded from this discussion. This discussion is based on recurring operations and excludes nonrecurring items, South America foreign currency transaction gains and losses and FAS 133 mark to market gains and losses. Contract Generation ($ in millions) 2002 2001 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $2,478 $2,417 $ 61 % of total revenues 28% 32% (4)% Operating margin $1,050 $ 854 $ 196 % of segment revenues 42% 35% 7% EBT $ 635 $ 532 $ 103 % of total EBT 54% 34% 20% Contract Generation consists of our power plants located around the world that have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks (primarily electricity prices) for a period of at least five years and for 75% or more of their expected output capacity. For 2002, Contract Generation revenues were $2.478 billion and represented 28% of total revenues for the year, an increase of $61 million over 2001. The most significant contributions continued to be from North and South America, which in aggregate comprised 63% of Contract Generation revenue for the year as compared to 64% for 2001. Revenues were enhanced with the addition of recently completed commercial contract generation businesses totaling 1,736 mw (added subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2001), including Red Oak in New Jersey (832 mw natural gas) Meghnaghat in Bangladesh (450 mw natural gas) and Puerto Rico (454 mw coal). Revenues also improved at Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, Tiszai in Hungary, Ebute in Nigeria, Haripur in Bangladesh and the Chigen plants in China. These improvements were offset by declines at Uruguaiana and Tiete in Brazil, the Gener plants in Chile, Mtkvari in the Republic of Georgia, Los Mina in the Dominican Republic and Merida in Mexico.
The operating margin (as a percentage of sales) for our Contract Generation segment showed significant improvement over 2001 at 42% for 2002 as compared to 35% for 2001. Stronger margins and margin percentages arose during the quarter at many contract generation plants and in all geographic regions, with the most significant improvements at the Gener plants in Chile, Uruguaiana in Brazil, Ironwood and Red Oak in the U.S., Kilroot in Northern Ireland, Ebute in Nigeria and the Chigen plants in China. These improvements were partially offset by declines at Tiete in Brazil, Shady Point in Oklahoma, Thames in Connecticut and Lal Pir/Pak Gen in Pakistan. Overall, Contract Generation operating margins increased $196 million to $1.050 billion for 2002. As a result, Contract Generation delivered $635 million of EBT (or 54% of the total) for 2002, an increase of 19% over 2001 EBT of $532 million (34% of the total). All geographic regions showed increases in EBT within the contract generation segment except for South America and the Caribbean. Competitive Supply ($ in millions) 2002 2001 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $1,837 $1,973 $ (136) % of total revenues 21% 26% (5)% Operating margin $ 394 $ 484 $ (90) % of segment revenues 21% 25% (4)% EBT $ 129 $ 182 $ (53) % of total EBT 11% 12% (1)% Competitive Supply consists primarily of our power plants selling electricity directly to wholesale customers in competitive markets and as a result the profitability of such plants are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal, in particular. For 2002, revenues for this segment were $1.837 billion and represented 21% of total revenues for the year. The most significant contributions continued to be from the competitive markets of the UK and the U.S. that in aggregate comprised 73% of Competitive Supply revenue for the year. Competitive market prices declined year over year in Argentina due to the devaluation of the Peso in January 2002 and prices were also lower in California and the UK compared to 2001 and as a result total revenue for the competitive supply segment decreased 7% from 2001. Certain plants showed offsetting revenue improvements including Tiszapalkonya in Hungary, Ottana in Italy and Chivor in Colombia. Year on year increases associated with new businesses in 2002 included Parana in Argentina (845 mw gas) and Delano in California (50 mw gas).
The operating margin (as a percentage of sales) for our Competitive Supply segment was 21% in 2002, a decrease from 25% in 2001. Margins and margin percentages were lower in South America, North America and Europe and Africa due primarily to lower market prices. The most significant declines were at Drax in the UK, the New York plants, Placerita in California and Alicura in Argentina. These declines were offset in part by improvements at Deepwater in Texas, Delano in California, Panama and Altai in Kazakhstan. Overall, operating margin for Competitive Supply declined 19% to $394 million for 2002. As a result of lower competitive prices, primarily in the US and the UK, Competitive Supply generated $129 million of EBT (or 11% of the total) for 2002, a decrease from 2001 EBT of $182 million. Large Utilities ($ in millions) 2002 2001 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $ 3,151 $ 1,642 $ 1,509 % of total revenues 36% 21% 15% Operating margin $ 781 $ 615 $ 166 % of segment revenues 25% 37% (12)% EBT $ 418 $ 774 $ (356) % of total EBT 36% 49% (13)% The Large Utilities segment is comprised of our four large integrated utilities that serve nearly 11 million customers in North America, the Caribbean and South America. Businesses include IPALCO in Indiana, EDC in Venezuela along with CEMIG (an equity affiliate) and Eletropaulo in Brazil. For 2002, revenues for this segment were $3.151 billion and represented 36% of total revenues for the year. The significant increase in revenues of 92% resulted from consolidating the results of Eletropaulo (serving Sao Paulo, Brazil) beginning in February 2002 when AES acquired control of that business with a 68% voting interest (increased from 49% prior to that date when Eletropaulo was treated as an equity affiliate). The additional revenues from Eletropaulo were offset in part by a 21% decrease in revenues at EDC due primarily to the devaluation of the Bolivar during 2002 and a slight decline in revenues at IPALCO. The operating margin was $781 million for the year, an increase of 27% over 2001 due to the consolidation of Eletropaulo and an improvement in the operating margin at IPALCO. These increases were offset by a decline in the operating margin at EDC. As a percentage of sales the operating margin for large utilities was 25%, down from 37% for
2001 because of the reductions in margin at EDC resulting in part from the devaluation of the Bolivar as well as lower than average segment margins at Eletropaulo. Large Utilities generated $418 million of EBT (or 36% of the total) for 2002, down from $774 million (or 49%) for 2001. The reduction in 2002 results primarily from reduced contributions (after associated interest costs) from Eletropaulo due to the slow recovery of electricity demand to pre-rationing levels in Brazil and from EDC due to the devaluation of the Bolivar and the deterioration in economic conditions in Venezuela. Growth Distribution ($ in millions) 2002 2001 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $ 1,326 $ 1,613 $ (287) % of total revenues 15% 21% (6)% Operating margin $ 150 $ 221 $ (71) % of segment revenues 11% 14% (3)% EBT $ (13) $ 86 $ (99) % of total EBT (1)% 5% (6)% Our Growth Distribution segment, serving over 5 million customers, consists of electricity distribution companies that are generally located in developing countries or regions where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate higher than in more developed regions. For 2002, revenues were $1.326 billion, an 18% decline from 2001, and represented 15% of total revenues for the year. The Caribbean represents the most significant contributor with 42% of growth distribution revenues, while South America represents 31% and Europe and Africa contributes the remaining 27%. The decrease in revenues is due primarily to significant reductions in Argentina because of the devaluation of the Argentine peso, as well as reductions at Sul in Brazil and at our distribution businesses in El Salvador. These reductions were offset in part by increases at Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in Ukraine as well as from Sonel in Cameroon. The operating margin (as a percentage of sales) was $150 million or 11% of revenues as compared with $221 million or 14% of revenues for 2001. Margins improved at Sonel in Cameroon, Telasi in Georgia, Kievoblenergo and Rivnooblenergo in the Ukraine and Ede Este in the Dominican Republic. As a result, Growth Distribution had an EBT loss of $(13) for 2002, a decline from EBT of $86 million in 2001.
