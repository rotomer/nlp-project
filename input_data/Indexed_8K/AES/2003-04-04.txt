Bank Facility Amendment
In conjunction with the refinancing transaction, AES is seeking an amendment to certain provisions of its senior secured credit facility to permit the proposed private placement and the tender offer and to make certain other changes. In connection with the refinancing and the amendment, and subject to consummation of the proposed private placement, AES will repay $475 million of borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
Private Placement
AES intends to launch a private placement of approximately $1 billion principal amount of second priority senior secured notes which will be secured by second priority liens on (1) the capital stock of certain subsidiaries of AES and (2) certain intercompany receivables, certain intercompany notes and intercompany tax sharing agreements owed to AES by its subsidiaries. The collateral also secures, among other things, AES's senior secured credit facility.
The second priority senior secured notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities laws. Therefore, the second priority senior secured notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and any applicable state securities laws. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the second priority senior secured notes.
