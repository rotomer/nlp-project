EXHIBIT 99.1 [LOGO] The Global Power Company NEWS RELEASE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Contact: Kenneth R. Woodcock (703) 522 1315 AES REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2003 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF $0.11 PER SHARE $991 Million In Parent Company Liquidity Provides Renewed Flexibility For Delevering And Growth - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ARLINGTON, VA, July 30, 2003 -- The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) announced today that income from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, was $65 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, up from a loss of $(101) million, or $(0.19) per diluted share for the second quarter of 2002. Income from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2003, was $142 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, up from income of $11 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2002. Net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 was $(129) million, or $(0.22) per diluted share compared to a loss of $(115) million, or $(0.22) per diluted share for the second quarter of 2002. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $(35) million, or $(0.06) per diluted share compared to a loss of $(428) million, or $(0.80) per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The net losses for all periods included charges for discontinued operations. For the second quarter of 2003, the charges in discontinued operations primarily arise from the Company's decision to classify it's businesses in The Republic of Georgia as held for sale. Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 were $2.2 billion, up from $2.0 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2002. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $4.4 billion, up from $4.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2002. Operating Income for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 was $459 million, up from $409 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2002. Operating Income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $1.04 billion, down from $1.05 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2002. AES also announced that consolidated net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2003 was $291 million and $737 million for the first half of 2003. Additionally, its subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $300 million and $480 million for the first half of 2003. Paul Hanrahan, Chief Executive Officer stated, "We are extremely pleased with the progress we have made in improving the financial situation of the Company. Looking back over the last 9 months and culminating with yesterday's completion of our bank loan financing, we have refinanced or raised approximately $5 billion of debt while increasing the average life of our parent maturities from 5.8 years to 7.8 years. During the quarter we also successfully raised $335 million in a common stock offering. In addition, we now have approximately $1
billion of cash on hand which provides renewed flexibility to continue our deleveraging program and to pursue attractive growth opportunities." Barry Sharp, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "In addition to the significant improvement in our maturity profile, we also continued to grow our corporate liquidity position with total distributions to the parent and qualified holding companies of $480 million through the first six months of 2003. Along with the proceeds from asset sales, we have also repaid debt at the parent level by over $660 million since December 2002 and we plan to continue that progress with our recently announced intention to call our $198 million 10.25% 2006 notes. For the full year of 2003 we continue to expect consolidated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $1.5 billion, with $737 million generated through the first six months."

Business Segment Results AES's business segments, which include Contract Generation, Large Utilities, Competitive Supply and Growth Distribution, generated combined income before income taxes, excluding the Corporate segment, of $205 million for the second quarter of 2003, as compared with $8 million for the second quarter of 2002. Total income before income taxes, including the Corporate segment, was $99 million for the second quarter of 2003, as compared with a loss of $(108) million for the same period in 2002. On a geographic basis, income before income taxes from the business segments was generated $92 million from North America, $130 million from South America, $37 million from Asia, $(36) million from Europe and Africa, and $(18) million from the Caribbean. Contract Generation ($ in millions) 2Q 2Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $735 $632 $103 % of total revenues 34% 31% 3% Gross margin $285 $260 $25 % of segment revenues 39% 41% (2)% Income before income taxes $124 $144 $(20) % of income before income taxes from segments 60% 1800% NM Contract Generation consists of multiple power generation facilities located around the world that have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks and electricity price volatility by entering into long-term (5 years or longer) power purchase agreements for 75% or more of their expected output capacity. For the second quarter of 2003, Contract Generation revenues were $735 million and represented 34% of total revenues, an increase of $103 million over the second quarter of 2002. The most significant contributions continued to be from North and South America, which in aggregate comprised 60% of Contract Generation revenue for the quarter as compared to 59% for the same period in 2002. Revenues were enhanced with the addition of recently completed commercial contract generation businesses totaling 1,451 mw (added subsequent to the second quarter of 2002), including Red Oak in New Jersey (832 mw gas), Puerto Rico (454 mw coal), Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka (165 mw gas), Barka in Oman (427 mw gas), Ras Laffan in Qatar (750 mw gas) and Andres in the Dominican Republic (310 mw gas). Revenues also improved at Los Mina in the Dominican Republic, Merida III in Mexico, Kilroot in Northern Ireland, Tiszai in Hungary and Ebute in Nigeria. These improvements were offset by declines at Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment, Warrior Run in Maryland, Tiete in Brazil and Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan. 5 of 13
The gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was $285 million for the quarter, an increase of 10% from the second quarter of 2002. Gross margin increases arose at Uruguaiana and Tiete in Brazil, Los Mina in the Dominican Republic, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and Ebute in Nigeria. Additionally, new plants that came online subsequent to the second quarter of 2002 contributed to the increase. These increases were offset by declines in gross margin at Beaver Valley and Ironwood in Pennsylvania, Shady Point in Oklahoma, the Southland plants in California and the Chigen plants in China. As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was 39% in the second quarter of 2003, a decline from 41% in the second quarter of 2002. Contract Generation generated $124 million of income before income taxes (or 60% of the net total) for the second quarter of 2003, a decrease from $144 million in the second quarter of 2002. South America showed an increase due to Gener in Chile and Uruguaiana in Brazil offset by a decrease at Tiete in Brazil. North America experienced declines due to Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, Warrior Run in Maryland due to FAS 133 mark-to-market losses and Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment. These declines were partially offset by increases in the Southland plants in California. The Caribbean experienced an overall decrease due to the write-off of capitalized costs associated with El Faro, a development project in Honduras that was terminated during the second quarter of 2003. This decrease was partially offset by the start of commercial operations at Puerto Rico. Income before taxes was relatively consistent between periods for Asia and for Europe/Africa. Competitive Supply ($ in millions) 2Q 2Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $363 $373 $(10) % of total revenues 17% 18% (1)% Gross margin $18 $85 $(67) % of segment revenues 5% 23% (18)% Loss before income taxes $(31) $(37) $6 % of income before income taxes from segments (15)% (463)% NM Competitive Supply consists primarily of the power plants selling electricity directly to wholesale customers in competitive markets and, as a result, the profitability of such plants are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal, in particular. For the second quarter of 2003, Competitive Supply revenues were $363 million and represented 17% of total revenues for the quarter. The most significant contributions 6 of 13
continued to be from the competitive markets of the U.S. and the UK that in aggregate comprised 74% of Competitive Supply revenue for the quarter. Competitive market prices increased quarter over quarter in New York, which resulted in increased revenue in the New York plants. Additionally, other plants showed revenue improvements, including Parana in Argentina and Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan. An increase in revenue also resulted from the start of commercial operations at Granite Ridge in New Hampshire (720 mw gas). These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from Deepwater in Texas due to an outage and from Drax in the UK. Despite increases in its sales volume quarter over quarter, Drax had lower revenues due to lower prices from the merchant market than what was received in 2002 under the TXU contract which was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Competitive Supply segment was 5% in the second quarter of 2003, a decrease from 23% in the second quarter of 2002. Overall, the gross margin for Competitive Supply decreased from $85 million to $18 million. Margins and margin percentages were lower at Deepwater in Texas, Granite Ridge in New Hampshire, Borsod in Hungary, Panama and Drax in the UK due to lower prices as a result of the termination of the TXU contract and increased cost of sales due to higher volume. These decreases were partially offset by increased margins and margin percentages in North and South America, including the New York plants and Parana. Competitive Supply had a loss before income taxes of $(31) million (or (15)% of the net total) for the second quarter of 2003, which represents a $6 million improvement over the same period in 2002. The Competitive Supply loss before income taxes remained fairly constant between 2002 and 2003. However, second quarter 2002 losses included depreciation of the Argentina Peso at Parana, the write-off of Infovias, and the loss on the CCI Investment, as compared to appreciation of the Argentina Peso during the second quarter of 2003 and additional losses at Drax in the UK due to operating in the merchant market in 2003 rather than under the TXU contract in 2002. Additionally Borsod in Hungary, Deepwater in Texas and Granite Ridge in New Hampshire experienced decreased income before income taxes in 2003. Large Utilities ($ in millions) 2Q 2Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $777 $863 $(86) % of total revenues 35% 42% (7)% Gross margin $164 $185 $(21) % of segment revenues 21% 21% - Income before income taxes $90 $50 $40 % of income before income taxes from segments 44% 625% NM 7 of 13
The Large Utilities segment is comprised of the large integrated utilities that serve nearly 7 million customers in North America, the Caribbean and South America. Businesses include IPALCO in Indiana, EDC in Venezuela and Eletropaulo in Brazil. For the second quarter of 2003, revenues for Large Utilities were $777 million and represented 35% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for Large Utilities decreased $86 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2002. Despite an increase in Eletropaulo's electricity sales, revenues for the second quarter of 2003 decreased when compared to the second quarter of 2002 due to higher average exchange rates in effect for 2003 compared to 2002. The quarter over quarter devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar negatively impacted the U.S. Dollar translated revenues of EDC and offset the impact of an increase in revenues resulting from a tariff increase. IPALCO also had a slight decrease quarter over quarter due to milder weather in 2003. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Large Utility segment was 21% for the second quarter of 2003 and 2002. Eletropaulo's gross margin decreased mainly due to higher average exchange rates in the second quarter of 2003 and higher pension cost compared to the second quarter of 2002. Additionally, IPALCO experienced a lower margin and margin percentage due to milder weather and higher operating and maintenance costs in 2003. Overall, gross margin for Large Utilities declined to $164 million for the second quarter of 2003 from $185 million in the second quarter of 2002. Large Utilities generated $90 million of income before income taxes (or 44% of the net total) for the second quarter of 2003, up from $50 million for the same period in 2002. The increase relates primarily to appreciation of the month end Brazilian Real rates from March 31, 2003 to June 30, 2003 and one-time charges taken in 2002 for the loss on sale of securities at EDC. The increases were offset by lower gross margin and substantially reduced foreign currency transaction gains at EDC during 2003, due to the devaluation in the Venezuelan Bolivar quarter over quarter, and a lower gross margin at IPALCO. Growth Distribution ($ in millions) 2Q 2Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $317 $170 $147 % of total revenues 14% 8% 6% Gross margin $24 $(94) $118 % of segment revenues 8% (55)% 63% Income (loss) before income taxes $22 $(149) $171 % of income before income taxes from segments 11% (1863)% NM The Growth Distribution segment, serving nearly 5 million customers, consists of electricity distribution companies that are generally located in developing countries or 8 of 13
regions where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate higher than in more developed regions. For the second quarter of 2003, revenues were $317 million, an 86% increase over the second quarter of 2002, and represented 14% of total revenues for the quarter. The Caribbean represents the most significant contributor with 38% of Growth Distribution revenues, while South America represents 35% and Europe/Africa contributes the remaining 27%. The increase in revenues is due primarily to the one-time charge taken in 2002 for the MAE write-off at Sul. Operationally, there were increases in revenues at Eden & Edes and Edelap in Argentina, Sonel in Cameroon, Clesa and Caess in El Salvador. These were partially offset by reductions at Sul in Brazil because of the higher average exchange rates during the second quarter of 2003 and Ede Este in the Dominican Republic. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Growth Distribution segment was 8% in the second quarter of 2003, an increase from (55)% in the second quarter of 2002. Gross margin and gross margin percentages declined at Ede Este in the Dominican Republic and Sonel in Cameroon. These declines were offset by an increased gross margin at Caess in El Salvador and the one-time adjustment taken in 2002 for the MAE write-off at Sul. Overall, the gross margin for the Growth Distribution segment increased to $24 million for the second quarter of 2003. Growth Distribution businesses generated $22 million of income before income taxes for the second quarter of 2003, an increase of $171 million from a loss before income taxes of $(149) million for the second quarter of 2002. Income before income taxes increased at Sul in Brazil, Eden & Edes in Argentina and Caess in El Salvador. These increases were partially offset by decreases at Ede Este in the Dominican Republic due, in part, to foreign exchange transaction losses caused by the devaluation of the Dominican Peso during the second quarter of 2003 as well as lower operating margins. 9 of 13

(1) Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to the following: a. We assume continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies. b. We assume operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels and in accordance with the provisions of the relevant contracts. c. Our assumptions about asset sales include transactions that are supported by signed agreements and that have been previously announced. (2) The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs. (3) AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness. Certain statements regarding AES's ("the Company's") business operations may constitute "forward looking statements" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are not historical facts, but are predictions about the future which inherently involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statement. We urge investors to read our descriptions and discussions of these risks that are contained under the section "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report/Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2002. 13 of 13
