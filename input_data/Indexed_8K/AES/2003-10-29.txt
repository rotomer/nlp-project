The results for all periods include amounts related to discontinued operations, including Drax, because of the Company's decision during the third quarter of 2003 to withdraw its support for a restructuring at that business. Paul Hanrahan, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "I am pleased with our results this quarter. We are beginning to see the positive financial impacts of our efforts to improve operating performance at our businesses as well as the effects of our corporate debt reduction efforts.
Additionally, we continue to see possibilities for attractive growth globally. The financial closing this quarter of our new 1200 mw contract generation power facility in Spain is one example of the select opportunities we are pursuing." Barry Sharp, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "Our operating income, earnings per share and cash flow results continue to be in line with our expectations. We are also pleased with the continued progress we made in reducing our corporate level debt. During the quarter we reduced parent debt by $605 million, resulting in cumulative corporate debt reduction of $1,028 million since the beginning of 2003. During the quarter we also completed the final component of our recent corporate refinancing efforts with the successful execution of our $950 million term loan and revolver financings."

Business Segment Results AES's business segments, which include Contract Generation, Large Utilities, Competitive Supply and Growth Distribution, generated combined income before income taxes, excluding the Corporate segment, of $214 million for the third quarter of 2003, as compared with a loss of $(202) million for the third quarter of 2002. Total income before income taxes, including the Corporate segment, was $66 million for the third quarter of 2003, as compared with a loss of $(298) million for the same period in 2002. On a geographic basis, income before income taxes from the business segments was generated $123 million from North America, $44 million from South America, $43 million from Asia, $(54) million from Europe and Africa, and $58 million from the Caribbean. All amounts have been restated to reflect discontinued operations that have occurred in the current and prior periods. Contract Generation ($ in millions) 3Q 3Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $817 $599 $218 % of total revenues 35% 32% 3% Gross margin $327 $242 $ 85 % of segment revenues 40% 40% --% Income before income taxes $ 71 $144 $(73) % of income before income taxes from segments 33% 71% (38)% Contract Generation consists of multiple power generation facilities located around the world that generally have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks and electricity price volatility by entering into long-term (5 years or longer) power purchase agreements for 75% or more of their expected output capacity. For the third quarter of 2003, Contract Generation revenues were $817 million and represented 35% of total revenues, an increase of $218 million over the third quarter of 2002. The most significant contributions continued to be from North and South America, which in aggregate comprised 58% of Contract Generation revenue for the quarter as compared to 68% for the same period in 2002. Revenues were enhanced with the addition of recently completed commercial contract generation businesses totaling 1,451 mw (added subsequent to the third quarter of 2002), including Red Oak in New Jersey (832 mw gas), Puerto Rico (454 mw coal), Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka (165 mw gas), Barka in Oman (427 mw gas), Ras Laffan in Qatar (750 mw gas) and Andres in the Dominican Republic (310 mw gas). Revenues also improved at Los Mina in the Dominican Republic, Merida III in Mexico, Tiszai in Hungary, Gener in Chile and Tiete in Brazil.
These improvements were offset by declines at Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment and at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan. The gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was $327 million for the quarter, an increase of 35% from the third quarter of 2002. Gross margin increases were attributable to Tiete in Brazil and Gener in Chile. Additionally, new plants that came online subsequent to the third quarter of 2002 contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by declines in gross margin at Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, Shady Point in Oklahoma and the Chigen plants in China. As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was 40% in the third quarter of 2003 which is consistent with the third quarter of 2002. Contract Generation generated $71 million of income before income taxes (or 33% of the net total) for the third quarter of 2003, a decrease from $144 million in the third quarter of 2002. South America showed an increase due to Gener in Chile and Tiete in Brazil. North America experienced declines due to Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, Warrior Run in Maryland due to significant FAS 133 mark-to-market gains in 2002, Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment and Hawaii due to write-offs of deferred financing and swap breakage costs of $22 million related to their non-recourse debt refinancing. These declines were partially offset by increases in the Southland plants in California. The Caribbean experienced an overall increase due to the start of commercial operations at Puerto Rico. Europe/Africa experienced a significant decrease due to the $76 million write-off of previously capitalized costs of Bujugali, a construction project in Uganda that the company decided to terminate during the third quarter of 2003. Asia had increases due to the start of commercial operations at Barka and Ras Laffan and improvements at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan. Competitive Supply ($ in millions) 3Q 3Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ----- -------- Segment revenues $288 $ 216 $ 72 % of total revenues 12% 11% 1% Gross margin $ 53 $ 50 $ 3 % of segment revenues 18% 23% (5)% Income (loss) before income taxes $ 20 $(152) $172 % of income before income taxes from segments 9% (75)% 84% Competitive Supply consists primarily of the power plants selling electricity directly to wholesale customers in competitive markets and, as a result, the profitability of such plants are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal, in particular.
For the third quarter of 2003, Competitive Supply revenues were $288 million and represented 12% of total revenues for the quarter. The most significant contributions were from the competitive markets of the U.S. which comprised 61% of Competitive Supply revenue for the quarter compared to 55% for the same quarter of 2002. Competitive market prices increased quarter over quarter in New York, which resulted in increased revenue in the New York plants. Additionally, other plants showed revenue improvements, including Alicura and CTSN in Argentina. An increase in revenue also resulted from the start of commercial operations at Granite Ridge in New Hampshire (720 mw gas) and Wolf Hollow in Texas (730 mw gas). These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from Deepwater in Texas due to an outage during the third quarter of 2003 and from Ottana in Italy. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Competitive Supply segment was 18% in the third quarter of 2003, a decrease from 23% in the third quarter of 2002. Overall, the gross margin for Competitive Supply increased to $53 million from $50 million. Margins and margin percentages were lower at Deepwater in Texas and Granite Ridge in New Hampshire. These decreases were partially offset by increased margins and margin percentages at the New York plants in North America, CTSN and Alicura in South America and Altai in Asia. Competitive Supply generated $20 million of income before taxes (or 9% of the net total) for the third quarter of 2003, which represents a $172 million improvement over the same period in 2002. The increase is primarily due to the write-off of $168 million of construction costs associated with Greystone, a project in Tennessee, in the third quarter of 2002. Operationally, during 2003 increases at CTSN in Argentina and the New York plants were partially offset by decreases at Granite Ridge in New Hampshire, Parana in Argentina and Deepwater in Texas. Large Utilities ($ in millions) 3Q 3Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ----- -------- Segment revenues $908 $ 783 $125 % of total revenues 39% 41% (2)% Gross margin $244 $ 199 $ 45 % of segment revenues 27% 25% 2% Income (loss) before income taxes $120 $(175) $295 % of income before income taxes from segments 56% (87)% 143% The Large Utilities segment is comprised of the large integrated utilities that serve nearly 7 million customers in North America, the Caribbean and South America. The Large Utility businesses include IPALCO in Indiana, EDC in Venezuela and Eletropaulo in Brazil.
For the third quarter of 2003, revenues for Large Utilities were $908 million and represented 39% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for Large Utilities increased $125 million, or 16%, from the third quarter of 2002. Eletropaulo's revenues for the third quarter increased due to appreciation of the Brazilian Real compared to the same quarter of 2002. EDC's revenues increased due to higher demand and a tariff increase offset by devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. IPALCO had a slight decrease quarter over quarter due to milder weather in 2003. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Large Utility segment was 27% for the third quarter of 2003 compared to 25% for the third quarter of 2002. Eletropaulo's gross margin increased mainly due to appreciation of the Brazilian Real. EDC's gross margin increased due to higher demand and increased tariffs in the third quarter of 2003 compared to 2002. IPALCO experienced a lower margin and margin percentage due to milder weather and higher operating and maintenance costs in 2003. Overall, gross margin for Large Utilities increased to $244 million for the third quarter of 2003 from $199 million in the third quarter of 2002. Large Utilities generated $120 million of income before income taxes (or 56% of the net total) for the third quarter of 2003, up from a loss of $(175) million for the same period in 2002. The increase relates primarily to the significant devaluation experienced in the third quarter of 2002 which resulted in foreign currency transaction losses of $244 million at Eletropaulo as compared to losses of $26 million in the third quarter of 2003. Growth Distribution ($ in millions) 3Q 3Q 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $309 $298 $ 11 % of total revenues 13% 16% (3)% Gross margin $ 30 $ 48 $(18) % of segment revenues 10% 16% (6)% Income (loss) before income taxes $ 3 $(19) $ 22 % of income before income taxes from segments 1% (9)% 10% The Growth Distribution segment, serving nearly 5 million customers, consists of electricity distribution companies that are generally located in developing countries or regions where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate higher than in more developed regions. For the third quarter of 2003, revenues were $309 million, a 3% increase over the third quarter of 2002, and represented 13% of total revenues for the quarter. The Caribbean and South America represent the most significant contributors with 74% of Growth
Distribution revenues, while Europe/Africa contributes the remaining 26%. There were increases in revenues at Eden & Edes and Edelap in Argentina, Sonel in Cameroon, Sul in Brazil and Clesa and Caess in El Salvador. These were partially offset by reductions at Ede Este in the Dominican Republic. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Growth Distribution segment was 10% in the third quarter of 2003, a decrease from 16% in the third quarter of 2002. Gross margin and gross margin percentages declined at Ede Este in the Dominican Republic and Sonel in Cameroon. These declines were partially offset by increased gross margins at Caess in El Salvador and Sul in Brazil. Overall, the gross margin for the Growth Distribution segment decreased to $30 million for the third quarter of 2003. Growth Distribution businesses generated $3 million of income before income taxes for the third quarter of 2003, an increase of $22 million from a loss before income taxes of $(19) million for the third quarter of 2002. Income before income taxes increased at Sul in Brazil and Caess in El Salvador. These increases were partially offset by lower operating margins at Ede Este in the Dominican Republic, Sonel in Cameroon and Eden & Edes in Argentina.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2003 the AES Corporation reduced parent and related debt by approximately $1,028 million (from $7,195 million to $6,167 million). (1) Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to the following: a. We assume continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies. b. We assume operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels and in accordance with the provisions of the relevant contracts. c. Our assumptions about asset sales include transactions that are supported by signed agreements and that have been previously announced. (2) The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs. (3) Total subsidiary distributions for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 were $799 million. (4) AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness. Certain statements regarding AES's ("the Company's") business operations may constitute "forward looking statements" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are not historical facts, but are predictions about the future which inherently involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in the forward looking statement. We urge investors to read our descriptions and discussions of these risks that are contained under the section "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report/Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2002.
