Business Segment Results AES's business segments, which include Contract Generation, Large Utilities, Competitive Supply and Growth Distribution, generated combined income before income taxes and minority interest, excluding the Corporate segment, of $1,234 million for 2003, as compared with a loss of $(863) million for 2002. Total income before income taxes and minority interest, including the Corporate segment, was $640 million for 2003, as compared with a loss of $(1,344) million for 2002. On a geographic basis, income before income taxes and minority interest from the business segments was generated $475 million from North America, $328 million from South America, $160 million from Asia, $55 million from Europe and Africa and $216 million from the Caribbean. During the fourth quarter of 2003, AES decided to exit Wolf Hollow, a 730 MW gas plant in Texas, Granite Ridge, a 720 MW gas plant in New Hampshire, and Termomamonal, a 90 MW gas plant in Colombia, all of which were previously reported in the competitive supply. Additionally, AES decided to exit Ede Este, a distribution company in the Dominican Republic which was previously reported in the growth distribution segment. All amounts have been restated to reflect discontinued operations that have occurred in the current and prior periods. Contract Generation ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ------ ------ -------- Segment revenues $3,108 $2,550 $558 % of total revenues 37% 35% 2% Gross margin $1,267 $1,065 $202 % of segment revenues 41% 42% (1)% Income before income taxes and minority interest $599 $665 $(66) % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 49% 77% (28)% Contract Generation consists of multiple power generation facilities located around the world that generally have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks and electricity price volatility by entering into long-term (5 years or longer) power purchase agreements for 75% or more of their expected output capacity. For 2003, Contract Generation revenues were $3,108 million and represented 37% of total revenues, an increase of $558 million over 2002. The most significant contributions came from North and South America, which in aggregate comprised 58% of Contract Generation revenue for the year as compared to 67% for the same period in 2002. Revenues were enhanced with the addition of recently completed contract generation businesses totaling 1,451 mw, including Red Oak in New Jersey (832 mw gas), Puerto Rico (454 mw coal), Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka (165 mw gas), Barka in Oman (427 mw gas), Ras Laffan in Qatar (750 mw gas) and Andres
in the Dominican Republic (310 mw gas). Revenues also improved at Los Mina in the Dominican Republic, Merida III in Mexico, Tiszai in Hungary, Gener in Chile and Tiete in Brazil. These improvements were offset by declines at Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment and at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan. The gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was $1,267 million for 2003, an increase of 19% from 2002. Gross margin increases were attributable to Tiete in Brazil, and Ebute in Nigeria. Additionally, new plants that came online contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by declines in gross margin at Beaver Valley and Ironwood in Pennsylvania, Shady Point in Oklahoma, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and the Chigen plants in China. As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was 41% for 2003 compared to 42% for 2002. Contract Generation generated $599 million of income before income taxes and minority interest (or 49% of the net total) for 2003, a decrease from $665 million for 2002. South America showed an increase due to Tiete in Brazil. North America experienced declines due to Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, Warrior Run in Maryland due to significant FAS 133 mark-to-market gains in 2002 related to their power purchase agreement, Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment in 2003 and Hawaii due to write-offs of deferred financing and swap breakage costs of $22 million related to their non-recourse debt refinancing during 2003. These declines were partially offset by increases in the Southland plants in California. The Caribbean experienced an overall increase due to the start of commercial operations at Andres in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico offset slightly by the write-off of project development costs related to El Faro, a terminated business development project in Honduras. Europe/Africa experienced a significant decrease due to the $76 million write-off of previously capitalized costs of Bujagali, a construction project in Uganda that the company decided to terminate during the third quarter of 2003 and Zeg, a construction project in Poland that the company decided to terminate during the fourth quarter of 2003. Asia had overall decreases due to declines at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan and Chigen in China which were partially offset by the start of commercial operations at Barka and Ras Laffan. Competitive Supply ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $880 $812 $68 % of total revenues 10% 11% (1)% Gross margin $220 $183 $37 % of segment revenues 25% 23% 2% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest $140 $(357) $497 % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 11% (41)% 52%
Competitive Supply consists primarily of the power plants selling electricity directly to wholesale customers in competitive markets and, as a result, the profitability of such plants are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal, in particular. For 2003, Competitive Supply revenues were $880 million and represented 10% of total revenues for the year. The most significant contributions were from the competitive markets of the U.S., which comprised 51% of Competitive Supply revenue for 2003 and 2002. Competitive market prices increased year over year in New York, which resulted in increased revenue in the New York plants. Additionally, other plants showed revenue improvements, including Alicura and Parana in Argentina, Panama in the Caribbean and Ekibastuz in Asia. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from Deepwater in Texas due to an outage during the third quarter of 2003 and from Borsod in Hungary. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Competitive Supply segment was 25% for 2003, an increase from 23% for 2002. Overall, the gross margin for Competitive Supply increased to $220 million from $183 million. Margins and margin percentages were higher at the New York plants, CTSN and Parana in South America and Altai in Asia. These increases were partially offset by lower margins and margin percentages at Deepwater in Texas and Borsod. Competitive Supply generated $140 million of income before income taxes and minority interest (or 11% of the net total) for 2003, which represents a $497 million improvement over the same period in 2002. The increase is primarily due to the write-off of $168 million of construction costs associated with Greystone, a project in Tennessee, and $83 million of construction costs during 2002 related to Lake Worth, a project in Florida. Operationally, during 2003 increases at CTSN in Argentina and the New York plants were partially offset by decreases at Parana in Argentina, Panama, Borsod in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. Large Utilities ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ------ ------ -------- Segment revenues $3,301 $3,150 $151 % of total revenues 39% 43% (4)% Gross margin $762 $687 $75 % of segment revenues 23% 22% 1% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest $380 $(978) $1,358 % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 31% (113)% 144%
The Large Utilities segment is comprised of the large integrated utilities that serve nearly 7 million customers in North America, the Caribbean and South America. The Large Utility businesses include IPALCO in Indiana, EDC in Venezuela and Eletropaulo in Brazil. For 2003, revenues for Large Utilities were $3,301 million and represented 39% of total revenues for the year. Revenues for Large Utilities increased $151 million, or 5%, compared to 2002. Eletropaulo's revenues for the year increased due to appreciation of the Brazilian Real compared to the same quarter of 2002. EDC's revenues decreased due to devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar partially offset by a higher demand and a tariff increase. IPALCO had a slight increase year over year. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Large Utility segment was 23% for 2003 compared to 22% for 2002. The South America gross margin increased mainly due to an impairment charge taken for Cemig in the fourth quarter of 2002. EDC's gross margin increased due to higher demand and increased tariffs in 2003 compared to 2002. IPALCO experienced a lower margin and margin percentage due to milder weather and higher operating and maintenance costs in 2003. Overall, gross margin for Large Utilities increased to $762 million for 2003 from $687 million for 2002. Large Utilities generated $380 million of income before income taxes and minority interest (or 31% of the net total) for 2003, up from a loss of $(978) million for the same period in 2002. The increase relates primarily to impairment charges taken in 2002 for Eletropaulo and Cemig, which were not recurring in 2003. Growth Distribution ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ------ ---- -------- Segment revenues $1,126 $868 $258 % of total revenues 13% 12% 1% Gross margin $184 $15 $169 % of segment revenues 16% 2% 14% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest $115 $(193) $308 % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 9% (22)% 31% The Growth Distribution segment, serving nearly 4 million customers, consists of electricity distribution companies that are generally located in developing countries or regions where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate higher than in more developed regions. For 2003, revenues were $1,126 million, a 1% increase over 2002, and represented 13% of total revenues for the year. The Caribbean and South America represent the most
significant contributors with 67% of Growth Distribution revenues, while Europe/Africa contributes the remaining 33%. There were increases in revenues at Eden & Edes and Edelap in Argentina, Sonel in Cameroon and Clesa and Caess in El Salvador. These were partially offset by reductions at Sul in Brazil. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Growth Distribution segment was 16% for 2003, an increase from 2% for 2002. Gross margin and gross margin percentages increased at Sonel in Cameroon and Caess in El Salvador. Additionally, there was a nonrecurring charge taken in 2002 for the write-off of $141 million related to MAE settlements at Sul in Brazil that was not recurring in 2003. These increases were partially offset by decreased gross margins at Eden, Edes and Edelap in Argentina. Overall, the gross margin for the Growth Distribution segment increased to $184 million for 2003. Growth Distribution businesses generated $115 million of income before income taxes and minority interest for 2003, an increase of $308 million from a loss before income taxes of $(193) million for 2002. Income before income taxes and minority interest increased at Sul in Brazil and Caess in El Salvador. These increases were partially offset by lower operating margins at Eden & Edes in Argentina. Additionally, the charge taken in 2002 for the write-off of $141 million related to MAE settlements at Sul in Brazil contributed to the change.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS EXHIBIT EXHIBIT NUMBER 99.1 Press Release dated February 5, 2004.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AES REPORTS $0.56 EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR 2003 Consolidated Net Cash From Operating Activities $1.6 Billion Company Expects Double-Digit EPS Growth in 2004 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ARLINGTON, VA, February 5, 2004 -- The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported 2003 income from continuing operations of $336 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.56. These results compare to a 2002 loss from continuing operations of $(1.609) billion, or $(2.99) per diluted share. Sales for the full year were $8.415 billion, an increase of 14% over 2002 sales of $7.380 billion. Consolidated net cash provided by operating activities increased 9% to $1.576 billion, with subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies of $1.054 billion for the year, in line with the Company's 2003 target. For the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reported income from continuing operations of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $(1.407) billion or $(2.58) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Fourth quarter sales increased 22% to $2.281 billion compared to the year-ago period. For the quarter, consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $490 million, substantially above last year's result. Subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies were $255 million, slightly lower than distributions in the fourth quarter of 2002. Results from continuing operations for the 2003 fourth quarter and full year reflect the Company' intention to dispose of two gas-fired merchant generation facilities in the U.S., a gas-fired generation facility in Colombia, and a distribution business in the Dominican Republic, having determined they no longer fit with the Company's business strategy. As a result, these operations have been recorded as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter and full year 2003 results. Comparisons with prior periods have been adjusted to exclude results from those operations. Including the costs for discontinued operations and an accounting change, the company reported sharply narrower losses. For 2003, the company had a net loss of $(403) million, or $(0.67) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(3.509) billion or $(6.51) per diluted share in 2002. The company reported a fourth quarter net loss of $(444) million or $(0.71) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(2.766) billion or $(5.08) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Commenting on the results, President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanrahan said, "We have met our financial restructuring and performance goals for 2003. We enter 2004 a stronger company with increased financial flexibility, and we look to further strengthen our credit quality in the future. With the planned asset disposals announced today and the recently completed Brazil restructuring, we have repositioned the AES business portfolio to improve earnings stability through reduced exposure to the U.S.
merchant market and to exchange rate fluctuations in Brazil. Combined with our focus on improving the operating performance of our businesses, this sets the stage to leverage our strengths for disciplined growth in attractive markets going forward." Added Chief Financial Officer Barry Sharp, "In 2003 we generated strong cash flow and improved our business performance in a challenging operating environment in many parts of the world. We demonstrated our ability to improve parent company liquidity, strengthen the balance sheet, and refinance significant portions of our debt portfolio at attractive rates and for longer tenors. We are in an excellent position to use our operating cash flow to support further debt reduction and our capital spending program." Forward-Looking Guidance for 2004 AES expects its 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.62, under generally accepted accounting principles. Net consolidated cash flow from operating activities is expected to be between $1.6 and $1.7 billion. The operating scenario underlying this guidance assumes a number of market factors, including foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, asset impairments or disposals, as well as other significant factors could make actual results vary from this guidance. Additional guidance elements are presented in the company's 2003 Financial Review and 2004 Outlook presentation. 2003 Financial Review and 2004 Outlook Conference Call Information AES will host a conference call today to discuss these results and the outlook for 2004.

Business Segment Results AES's business segments, which include Contract Generation, Large Utilities, Competitive Supply and Growth Distribution, generated combined income before income taxes and minority interest, excluding the Corporate segment, of $1,234 million for 2003, as compared with a loss of $(863) million for 2002. Total income before income taxes and minority interest, including the Corporate segment, was $640 million for 2003, as compared with a loss of $(1,344) million for 2002. On a geographic basis, income before income taxes and minority interest from the business segments was generated $475 million from North America, $328 million from South America, $160 million from Asia, $55 million from Europe and Africa and $216 million from the Caribbean. During the fourth quarter of 2003, AES decided to exit Wolf Hollow, a 730 MW gas plant in Texas, Granite Ridge, a 720 MW gas plant in New Hampshire, and Termomamonal, a 90 MW gas plant in Colombia, all of which were previously reported in the competitive supply. Additionally, AES decided to exit Ede Este, a distribution company in the Dominican Republic which was previously reported in the growth distribution segment. All amounts have been restated to reflect discontinued operations that have occurred in the current and prior periods. Contract Generation ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ------ ------ -------- Segment revenues $3,108 $2,550 $558 % of total revenues 37% 35% 2% Gross margin $1,267 $1,065 $202 % of segment revenues 41% 42% (1)% Income before income taxes and minority interest $599 $665 $(66) % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 49% 77% (28)% Contract Generation consists of multiple power generation facilities located around the world that generally have contractually limited their exposure to commodity price risks and electricity price volatility by entering into long-term (5 years or longer) power purchase agreements for 75% or more of their expected output capacity. For 2003, Contract Generation revenues were $3,108 million and represented 37% of total revenues, an increase of $558 million over 2002. The most significant contributions came from North and South America, which in aggregate comprised 58% of Contract Generation revenue for the year as compared to 67% for the same period in 2002. Revenues were enhanced with the addition of recently completed contract generation businesses totaling 1,451 mw, including Red Oak in New Jersey (832 mw gas), Puerto Rico (454 mw coal), Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka (165 mw gas), Barka in Oman (427 mw gas), Ras Laffan in Qatar (750 mw gas) and Andres
in the Dominican Republic (310 mw gas). Revenues also improved at Los Mina in the Dominican Republic, Merida III in Mexico, Tiszai in Hungary, Gener in Chile and Tiete in Brazil. These improvements were offset by declines at Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment and at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan. The gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was $1,267 million for 2003, an increase of 19% from 2002. Gross margin increases were attributable to Tiete in Brazil, and Ebute in Nigeria. Additionally, new plants that came online contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by declines in gross margin at Beaver Valley and Ironwood in Pennsylvania, Shady Point in Oklahoma, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and the Chigen plants in China. As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin for the Contract Generation segment was 41% for 2003 compared to 42% for 2002. Contract Generation generated $599 million of income before income taxes and minority interest (or 49% of the net total) for 2003, a decrease from $665 million for 2002. South America showed an increase due to Tiete in Brazil. North America experienced declines due to Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, Warrior Run in Maryland due to significant FAS 133 mark-to-market gains in 2002 related to their power purchase agreement, Shady Point in Oklahoma due to a step-down in the contracted capacity payment in 2003 and Hawaii due to write-offs of deferred financing and swap breakage costs of $22 million related to their non-recourse debt refinancing during 2003. These declines were partially offset by increases in the Southland plants in California. The Caribbean experienced an overall increase due to the start of commercial operations at Andres in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico offset slightly by the write-off of project development costs related to El Faro, a terminated business development project in Honduras. Europe/Africa experienced a significant decrease due to the $76 million write-off of previously capitalized costs of Bujagali, a construction project in Uganda that the company decided to terminate during the third quarter of 2003 and Zeg, a construction project in Poland that the company decided to terminate during the fourth quarter of 2003. Asia had overall decreases due to declines at Lal Pir and Pak Gen in Pakistan and Chigen in China which were partially offset by the start of commercial operations at Barka and Ras Laffan. Competitive Supply ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ---- ---- -------- Segment revenues $880 $812 $68 % of total revenues 10% 11% (1)% Gross margin $220 $183 $37 % of segment revenues 25% 23% 2% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest $140 $(357) $497 % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 11% (41)% 52%
Competitive Supply consists primarily of the power plants selling electricity directly to wholesale customers in competitive markets and, as a result, the profitability of such plants are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity, natural gas and coal, in particular. For 2003, Competitive Supply revenues were $880 million and represented 10% of total revenues for the year. The most significant contributions were from the competitive markets of the U.S., which comprised 51% of Competitive Supply revenue for 2003 and 2002. Competitive market prices increased year over year in New York, which resulted in increased revenue in the New York plants. Additionally, other plants showed revenue improvements, including Alicura and Parana in Argentina, Panama in the Caribbean and Ekibastuz in Asia. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from Deepwater in Texas due to an outage during the third quarter of 2003 and from Borsod in Hungary. Gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Competitive Supply segment was 25% for 2003, an increase from 23% for 2002. Overall, the gross margin for Competitive Supply increased to $220 million from $183 million. Margins and margin percentages were higher at the New York plants, CTSN and Parana in South America and Altai in Asia. These increases were partially offset by lower margins and margin percentages at Deepwater in Texas and Borsod. Competitive Supply generated $140 million of income before income taxes and minority interest (or 11% of the net total) for 2003, which represents a $497 million improvement over the same period in 2002. The increase is primarily due to the write-off of $168 million of construction costs associated with Greystone, a project in Tennessee, and $83 million of construction costs during 2002 related to Lake Worth, a project in Florida. Operationally, during 2003 increases at CTSN in Argentina and the New York plants were partially offset by decreases at Parana in Argentina, Panama, Borsod in Hungary and Deepwater in Texas. Large Utilities ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ------ ------ -------- Segment revenues $3,301 $3,150 $151 % of total revenues 39% 43% (4)% Gross margin $762 $687 $75 % of segment revenues 23% 22% 1% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest $380 $(978) $1,358 % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 31% (113)% 144%
The Large Utilities segment is comprised of the large integrated utilities that serve nearly 7 million customers in North America, the Caribbean and South America. The Large Utility businesses include IPALCO in Indiana, EDC in Venezuela and Eletropaulo in Brazil. For 2003, revenues for Large Utilities were $3,301 million and represented 39% of total revenues for the year. Revenues for Large Utilities increased $151 million, or 5%, compared to 2002. Eletropaulo's revenues for the year increased due to appreciation of the Brazilian Real compared to the same quarter of 2002. EDC's revenues decreased due to devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar partially offset by a higher demand and a tariff increase. IPALCO had a slight increase year over year. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Large Utility segment was 23% for 2003 compared to 22% for 2002. The South America gross margin increased mainly due to an impairment charge taken for Cemig in the fourth quarter of 2002. EDC's gross margin increased due to higher demand and increased tariffs in 2003 compared to 2002. IPALCO experienced a lower margin and margin percentage due to milder weather and higher operating and maintenance costs in 2003. Overall, gross margin for Large Utilities increased to $762 million for 2003 from $687 million for 2002. Large Utilities generated $380 million of income before income taxes and minority interest (or 31% of the net total) for 2003, up from a loss of $(978) million for the same period in 2002. The increase relates primarily to impairment charges taken in 2002 for Eletropaulo and Cemig, which were not recurring in 2003. Growth Distribution ($ in millions) 2003 2002 Variance ------ ---- -------- Segment revenues $1,126 $868 $258 % of total revenues 13% 12% 1% Gross margin $184 $15 $169 % of segment revenues 16% 2% 14% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interest $115 $(193) $308 % of income before income taxes and minority interest from segments 9% (22)% 31% The Growth Distribution segment, serving nearly 4 million customers, consists of electricity distribution companies that are generally located in developing countries or regions where the demand for electricity is expected to grow at a rate higher than in more developed regions. For 2003, revenues were $1,126 million, a 1% increase over 2002, and represented 13% of total revenues for the year. The Caribbean and South America represent the most
significant contributors with 67% of Growth Distribution revenues, while Europe/Africa contributes the remaining 33%. There were increases in revenues at Eden & Edes and Edelap in Argentina, Sonel in Cameroon and Clesa and Caess in El Salvador. These were partially offset by reductions at Sul in Brazil. The gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the Growth Distribution segment was 16% for 2003, an increase from 2% for 2002. Gross margin and gross margin percentages increased at Sonel in Cameroon and Caess in El Salvador. Additionally, there was a nonrecurring charge taken in 2002 for the write-off of $141 million related to MAE settlements at Sul in Brazil that was not recurring in 2003. These increases were partially offset by decreased gross margins at Eden, Edes and Edelap in Argentina. Overall, the gross margin for the Growth Distribution segment increased to $184 million for 2003. Growth Distribution businesses generated $115 million of income before income taxes and minority interest for 2003, an increase of $308 million from a loss before income taxes of $(193) million for 2002. Income before income taxes and minority interest increased at Sul in Brazil and Caess in El Salvador. These increases were partially offset by lower operating margins at Eden & Edes in Argentina. Additionally, the charge taken in 2002 for the write-off of $141 million related to MAE settlements at Sul in Brazil contributed to the change.
