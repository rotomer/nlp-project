Item 5. Other Events
Business Segment Results Sales increased in all four business segments and the segment contribution to gross margin increased in the three largest segments. o In Contract Generation, AES's largest segment, sales grew 21% to $868 million and gross margin improved 24% to $359 million in the first quarter of 2004. Increases were due primarily to the addition of new generation plants and improved operating results at Gener in Chile, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and generation businesses in Brazil. o Large Utilities sales increased 17% to $818 million and gross margin improved 18% to $194 million for 2004. Increases were primarily driven by tariff increases at EDC and Eletropaulo along with lower fuel costs, reduced operating costs and favorable currency effects. o The Growth Distribution segment sales increased 24% to $328 million and gross margin increased 26% to $63 million, respectively, benefiting from improved tariffs and operating results, together with favorable currency effects and improved margins at distribution businesses in El Salvador. o Sales in Competitive Supply increased 6% to $243 million while gross margin declined 7% to $64 million, primarily as a result of lower capacity revenues and higher coal costs in New York during the first quarter of 2004. Overall, consolidated sales increased 18% to $2.3 billion for 2004 and total gross margin from the four operating segments increased 19% over 2003 to $680 million. Of the first quarter 2004 total segment gross margin, 53% was from Contract Generation, 29% from Large Utilities, 9% from Growth Distribution and 9% from Competitive Supply.
(1) The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs. (2) AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.

INDEX TO EXHIBITS Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release dated April 28, 2004

EXHIBIT 99.1 AES REPORTS STRONG FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS AND REAFFIRMS 2004 EARNINGS GUIDANCE Operating Income Increased 18% to $618 Million on Sales of $2.3 Billion ARLINGTON, VA, April 28, 2004 -- The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported first quarter results that included an increase of 18% in operating income to $618 million on sales of $2.3 billion. AES also reaffirmed its 2004 earnings guidance. The table below summarizes sales, operating income, income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, adjusted earnings per share*, and net income for the first quarter of 2004 and 2003. ($ millions except per share) First Quarter First Quarter 2004 2003 Sales $2,257 $1,911 Operating Income $618 $523 Income From Continuing Operations $74 $131 Diluted Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations $0.12 $0.23 Adjusted Earnings Per Share* $0.17 $0.13 Net Income $48 $93 * non-GAAP financial measure - see definition below Commenting on the results, President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanrahan said, "We achieved broad-based, strong and encouraging sales and operating income growth during the quarter across our diversified portfolio of generation and distribution businesses. Our continued focus on operations, combined with stronger macroeconomic fundamentals, are both reflected in this quarter's results, and we continue to see additional opportunity ahead. I'm also encouraged by the progress and rational responses of regulatory authorities on tariff increases. We continued to reduce parent debt with additional repayments and repurchases this quarter totaling $351 million." Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) early retirement of debt, (b) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (c) foreign currency transaction impacts on net debt, and (d) significant asset impairments. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflect the
underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, and periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given quarter. For the first quarter of 2004, adjusted earnings per share were $0.17, an increase of 31% over adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 for the first quarter of 2003. Business Segment Results Sales increased in all four business segments and the segment contribution to gross margin increased in the three largest segments. o In Contract Generation, AES's largest segment, sales grew 21% to $868 million and gross margin improved 24% to $359 million in the first quarter of 2004. Increases were due primarily to the addition of new generation plants and improved operating results at Gener in Chile, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and generation businesses in Brazil. o Large Utilities sales increased 17% to $818 million and gross margin improved 18% to $194 million for 2004. Increases were primarily driven by tariff increases at EDC and Eletropaulo along with lower fuel costs, reduced operating costs and favorable currency effects. o The Growth Distribution segment sales increased 24% to $328 million and gross margin increased 26% to $63 million, respectively, benefiting from improved tariffs and operating results, together with favorable currency effects and improved margins at distribution businesses in El Salvador. o Sales in Competitive Supply increased 6% to $243 million while gross margin declined 7% to $64 million, primarily as a result of lower capacity revenues and higher coal costs in New York during the first quarter of 2004. Overall, consolidated sales increased 18% to $2.3 billion for 2004 and total gross margin from the four operating segments increased 19% over 2003 to $680 million. Of the first quarter 2004 total segment gross margin, 53% was from Contract Generation, 29% from Large Utilities, 9% from Growth Distribution and 9% from Competitive Supply. AES Reaffirms 2004 Forward-Looking Earnings Guidance AES reaffirmed its 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of $0.62, excluding the $0.03 per share cost associated with the previously disclosed Gener debt transaction costs. Noting the Company's favorable earnings outlook, Hanrahan said, "We remain optimistic about the
outlook for sales and earnings growth in 2004 and beyond, as we continue to drive performance through productivity improvement, continued deleveraging, and disciplined growth." Other The Company has adopted FASB's Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003) (FIN 46R) regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities as of March 31, 2004. The Company continues to analyze recent interpretations of the pronouncement as they relate to variable interests, including certain power sales agreements, which if applicable, could lead to the deconsolidation of the associated entities. We will report our results consistent with FIN 46R within the first quarter 10Q filing. As the Company adopted FIN 46R on March 31, 2004, the outcome of any potential deconsolidation impacts, if any, will not affect the AES income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and would only have an impact on certain balance sheet amounts and classifications. In future periods adoption of FIN 46R could reduce reported sales and costs of certain entities. This would not affect reported income from continuing operations or diluted earnings per share.

Safe Harbor Disclosure: This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to future earnings, growth and financial and operating performance. Forward-looking statements are not intended to be a guarantee of future results, but instead constitute AES's current expectations based on reasonable assumptions. Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies and operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Important factors that could affect actual results are discussed in AES's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to the risks discussed under the caption "Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors" in AES's most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Readers are encouraged to read AES's filings to learn more about the risk factors associated with AES's business. AES undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
(1) The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs. (2) AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
