The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported significant increases in sales, gross margin and operating income for the second quarter of 2004. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.10 and adjusted earnings per share* were $0.15. Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effects of gains or losses from certain foreign currency transactions, risk management mark-to-market accounting and early parent company debt retirement, plus an asset impairment in the 2003 quarter. For the prior year quarter, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.24, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.05.
ARLINGTON, VA, July 29, 2004 
 
Second Quarter Financial Highlights
 
      Sales growth for the quarter was strong, increasing 14% to $2,263 million compared to $1,992 million in 2003. Sales were driven by higher prices and demand and new plants in operation, partly offset by foreign currency translation effects.
 - 
      Gross margin increased 20% to $648 million compared to $539 million last year, while gross margin as a percent of sales increased to 29% from 27%. Operating income increased 24% to $611 million. These increases were largely attributable to the increased sales and operating performance improvements. The gross margin percentage improvement was largely driven by improved prices and performance gains.
 - 
      Net interest expense declined 16% to $390 million compared to $462 million in the prior year, reflecting the benefits of financial restructuring and debt repayments.
 - 
 
 
 - 
     
The effective tax rate increased to 32% from 29% a year ago, but remained unchanged from the first quarter of 2004.
 - 
     
Net income was $38 million, compared to a prior period loss of $129 million.
 
"We continue to improve the underlying earnings potential of our business portfolio," said Paul Hanrahan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Higher tariffs and demand, reduction of commercial losses and improved plant operations are driving operating income growth. As a result, we believe we are on track to achieve our 2004 financial targets."
 
Second Quarter Segment Highlights
 
      In Contract Generation, AES's largest segment, sales in the second quarter grew 18% to $868 million from $735 million in 2003, reflecting contract price escalation, increased demand, and new projects on line. Gross margin improved 14% to $326 million from $286 million a year ago, benefiting from the higher sales. Gross margin as a percent of sales declined to 38% from 39% a year ago, influenced principally by the higher cost of gas and purchased electricity in Chile, more than offsetting strong demand growth in that country.
 - 
      Competitive Supply sales grew 27% to $248 million from $196 million in the 2003 quarter, benefiting largely from increased demand and new projects on line. Gross margin increased 18% to $53 million from $45 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of sales declined to 21% from 23% a year ago, reflecting higher coal prices and maintenance costs in the New York plants.
 - 
      Large Utilities sales increased 7% to $834 million from $778 million in the prior period, driven primarily by tariff increases and reduced non-commercial losses, partly offset by foreign currency translation effects. Gross margin increased 27% to $207 million from $163 million in the prior period, attributable to higher sales and performance improvements. Gross margin as a percent of sales improved to 25% from 21% a year ago, reflecting the benefit of improved performance in the US and Brazil.
 - 
      Growth Distribution sales increased 11% to $313 million compared to $283 million last year, helped by increased demand as well as higher tariffs. Gross margin increased 38% to $62 million compared to $45 million a year ago. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased to 20% from 16%, reflecting improved performance in Cameroon.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (1)
 
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance.  Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, and periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to the 2004 presentation.
(1)
              
 
The Six Months Ended June 30, 2004 includes $(0.03) related to Gener debt restructuring costs included in interest expense in the first quarter of 2004.
(2)
              
 
NOTE:  AES revised the definition of adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2004 to focus greater attention on only three key currencies resulting in foreign currency transaction gains or losses on net monetary positions (those of Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina).  The prior definition included the effects of all foreign currencies.  In addition, only significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments are included.  The prior definition included all asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments.  Finally, the revised definition reflects the specific tax impact of each amount.  The result is no net effect on the adjusted earnings per share for the first half of either 2003 or 2004, with some minor reallocation to the first quarter of both 2003 and 2004, and a $0.03 increase in the annual adjusted EPS for 2003 from $0.53 to $0.56.

PARENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION
PARENT ONLY DATA: LAST FOUR QUARTERS
($ in millions)
 
 
 
(1)  The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US.  Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company.  Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US.  These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US.  Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs.
 
(2)  AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
