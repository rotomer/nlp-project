Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) continued its strong operating performance for the year and today reported third quarter net income of $140 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $76 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, last year.
ARLINGTON, VA October 28, 2004 
 
Third Quarter Financial Highlights
 
Revenues for the quarter increased 9% to $2,423 million, compared to $2,231 million in 2003.
 - 
                   
Gross margin increased 8% to $731 million compared to $676 million in 2003.
 - 
                   
Income before income taxes and minority interest increased to $263 million from $131 million in 2003. This represents a 28% increase excluding asset impairments of $75 million in 2003.
 - 
                   
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.20 versus $0.10 in 2003. The 2004 results include an increase in the Company's effective tax rate arising from higher distributions from and earnings of certain non-US subsidiaries.
 - 
                   
 
Adjusted earnings per share* for the third quarter of 2004 was $0.21, compared to $0.26 per share for the third quarter 2003 with the difference primarily due to the higher tax rate in 2004.  Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effects of gains or losses from risk management mark-to-market accounting, certain foreign currency transactions, significant net asset gains or losses and impairments and early retirement of recourse debt.
 
Note: This analysis of adjusted earnings per share involves a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share.

"I am pleased with the strong performance for the first nine months of this year.  We're achieving double digit growth in gross margin and adjusted earnings per share and continuing to see improvements in the performance of our businesses," said Paul Hanrahan, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We expect this momentum to continue through the rest of 2004 and have increased our guidance accordingly."
 
Updated Financial Guidance
 
AES increased its 2004 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $0.68 from $0.64.  It also reaffirmed its 2004 guidance of $0.62 for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the ($0.03) per share impact of the Chile financial restructuring.  This results in net guidance of $0.59 per diluted share from continuing operations.  The difference of $0.09 per share is attributable to gains or losses from risk management mark-to-market accounting, certain foreign currency transactions, significant net asset gains or losses and impairments and early retirement of recourse debt included in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.
 
Revenue is now expected to increase 11% for the year, compared to prior guidance of 7%.  Further information on the Company's updated and prior financial guidance can be found in the AES Third Quarter 2004 Financial Review presentation at

Third Quarter Segment Highlights
 
 - 
                   
Contract Generation revenues grew 11% to $906 million from $817 million in 2003, due primarily to increased contract prices and new projects on line, partially offset by lower volumes related to a plant upgrade underway in Hungary.  Gross margin improved 14% to $372 million from $327 million over the prior quarter.  Gross margin as a percent of sales improved to 41% from 40% over the prior quarter.
 - 
                   
Competitive Supply revenues grew 15% to $265 million from $230 million in 2003, resulting from increased demand, new projects on line and higher realized prices in Argentina and Kazakhstan that were partially offset by lower prices in New York.  Gross margin increased 8% to $64 million from $59 million last year.  Gross margin as a percent of sales decreased to 24% from 26% in the prior quarter.
 - 
                   
Large Utilities revenues increased 3% to $938 million from $908 million in 2003, driven by tariff increases.  Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 7% over the prior quarter.  Gross margin declined 4% to $234 million from $244 million in the prior quarter, attributable to higher fixed costs and negative impacts from foreign currency translation. Gross margin as a percent of sales also declined to 25% from 27% in the prior quarter.
 - 
                   
Growth Distribution revenues increased 14% to $314 million compared to $276 million in 2003, helped by increased demand and higher tariffs.  Gross margin, also aided by lower operating costs, increased 33% to $61 million compared to $46 million a year ago.  Gross margin as a percent of sales increased to 19% from 17%.
 
Nine Month Financial Highlights
 
Revenues increased 13% to $6,943 million from $6,134 million in the prior year, benefiting from higher prices and demand, foreign currency translation effects and new plants on line.  Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 12% year-over-year.
 - 
                  
Gross margin showed significant improvement, increasing 15% to $2,059 million compared to $1,789 million in last year's first nine months.  This increase was largely attributable to increased revenues and other operating performance improvements.  Gross margin as a percent of sales also improved to 30% versus 29% in 2003.
 - 
                  
Interest expense declined 6% to $1,423 million compared to $1,518 million in the prior year, reflecting the benefits of financial restructuring and debt retirement, partially offset by higher short-term interest rates and new project debt.
 - 
                  
Income before taxes and minority interest was $649 million, up 14% over the $569 million for the prior year, due to higher gross margin and lower interest expense in 2004 as well as asset impairments of $106 million in 2003, partially offset by net foreign currency transaction losses.
 - 
                  
The effective tax rate was 31% compared to 28% a year ago reflecting higher US taxes related to distributions from and earnings of certain non-US subsidiaries.
 - 
                  
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were $0.42 compared to $0.56 for the 2003 period. Adjusted earnings per share* for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 increased 16% from $0.45 to $0.52.
 - 
                  
Net income was $226 million compared to $40 million in the first nine months of 2003.  Net income in the 2003 period was adversely affected by the impact of discontinued operations, including several development project write-offs.
 - 
                  
Net cash from operating activities was $1,109 million, $23 million higher than in the prior year.  Excluding $29 million of cash flows from discontinued operations included in 2003, net cash from operating activities would have increased $52 million from the prior year.  In 2004, improved operating income was partially offset by increased working capital which was driven by Eletropaulo payments for outstanding payables from the period prior to its debt restructuring.
 - 
                   
Recourse debt has been reduced by $469 million and total recourse and non-recourse debt reduced by $1,128 million since the beginning of the year, reflecting completion of several financial restructuring transactions and continued debt repayments.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (1)
 
 
(1)
         
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions,
(b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina,
(c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance.  Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, and periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to the 2004 presentation.
 
(2)
         
The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2004 includes $(0.03) related to Chile debt restructuring costs included in interest expense in the first quarter of 2004.
 
NOTE:  AES revised the definition of adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2004 to focus greater attention on only three key currencies resulting in foreign currency transaction gains or losses on net monetary positions (those of Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina).  The prior definition included the effects of all foreign currencies.  In addition, only significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments are included.  The prior definition included all asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments.  Finally, the revised definition reflects the specific tax impact of each amount.  The result is no net effect on the adjusted earnings per share for the first half of either 2003 or 2004, with some minor reallocation to the first quarter of both 2003 and 2004, and a $0.03 increase in the annual adjusted EPS for 2003 from $0.53 to $0.56.

Liquidity (2)

(1)  The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US.  Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company.  Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US.  These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US.  Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs.
 
(2)  AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's  indebtedness.
