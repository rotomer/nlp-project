AES REPORTS STRONG FOURTH QUARTER AND 2004 RESULTS Record Revenue in 2004; Continued Earnings Growth Projected in 2005
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported strong results for the fourth quarter and full year, with record annual revenues of $9.5 billion.  In the fourth quarter, net income was $169 million and earnings were $0.26 per diluted share.  This compares to a loss of $443 million or $(0.71) per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003. These results include favorable adjustments related to the final disposition of discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus write-downs on discontinued businesses and impairment losses taken in the prior year quarter. Income from continuing operations, which excludes these adjustments, was $102 million or $0.16 per diluted share, up substantially from $4 million or $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.
ARLINGTON, VA, February 3, 2005 
 
Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.21 compared to $0.11 last year. Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) excludes from diluted earnings per share from continuing operations the effects of gains or losses from mark-to-market accounting related to derivatives, certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, significant impacts from net asset disposals or impairments and early retirements of recourse debt. See the attached Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share.
 
For the full year, AES reported net income of $395 million or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $(403) million or $(0.67) per diluted share in 2003. Income from continuing operations was $376 million or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to $336 million or $0.56 per diluted share in 2003. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $0.74 compared to $0.56 in 2003.
 
"We had a strong quarter and a very good year overall.  Once again we met or exceeded our key financial goals," said Paul Hanrahan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our focus on improving our existing businesses resulted in improved earnings quality and solid growth in revenue, gross margin and earnings.  We remain on track to meet our long-term annual earnings per share growth rate of 13-19% through 2008."
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
      Revenues increased 11% to $2,528 million, compared to $2,281 million in the prior year quarter.
 - 
      Gross margin was $709 million, a 10% increase from $644 million for the prior year quarter.  Gross margin as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter was 28.0% compared to 28.2% a year ago.
 - 
      Income before taxes and minority interest increased to $235 million, or 231% compared to $71 million in the prior year.
 - 
      Net cash from operating activities was $459 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 - 
      The net reduction in recourse debt was $318 million in the quarter while the net increase in non-recourse debt was $391 million due to borrowings for new projects.
 - 
 
Fourth Quarter Segment Highlights
 
      Large Utilities revenues increased 11% to $1,009 million from $913 million in 2003, driven primarily by higher tariff rates, a shift in revenues towards residential customers and revenue recovery of NOx compliance program costs.  The impacts of foreign currency translation were not significant in the quarter compared to the prior year.  Gross margin increased 30% to $248 million from $191 million in the prior year quarter, attributable primarily to the higher tariffs.In addition, gross margin as a percent of sales improved to 24.6% from 20.9% in the prior year quarter largely driven by revenue gains and lower fixed costs in our South American business.
 - 
 
      Growth Distribution revenues increased 16% to $350 million compared to $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 due to higher tariffs, favorable foreign currency translation impacts and increased demand.  Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 13% for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus the same quarter in 2003.  Gross margin declined to $28 million compared to $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 while gross margin as a percent of sales declined similarly to 8.0% from 13.9%.  These decreases were largely driven by a $16 million severance charge for workforce restructuring taken in the fourth quarter of 2004 by AES Sonel, our business in Cameroon, related to cost and overhead reduction objectives.
 - 
      Contract Generation revenues increased 8% to $905 million from $840 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, due primarily to increased pricing, new projects on line and favorable foreign currency translation effects.  Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 6% for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus the same quarter in 2003.  Gross margin increased 4% to $378 million from $364 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin as a percent of sales declined to 41.8% from 43.3% in the fourth quarter of 2003 primarily due to higher plant dispatching rates among our contracted businesses.
 - 
      Competitive Supply revenues increased 17% to $264 million from $225 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting from higher realized prices, new projects on line, favorable foreign currency translation effects and increased production volumes.  Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 13% for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus the same quarter in 2003.  Gross margin also increased 17% to $55 million from $47 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Gross margin as a percent of sales remained stable at 20.8% compared to 20.9% in the prior year quarter.
 - 
 
Full Year Highlights
 
Full-year revenues were $9,471 million, an increase of 13% over $8,415 million in 2003. Excluding foreign currency translation effects revenues increased 11% for the year.
 - 
     
Gross margin was $2,768 million, an increase of $335 million or 14% compared to 2003 reflecting positive contributions across all four segments.  Higher prices along with the contribution from new projects drove the significant increase.  Less than 7% of the $335 million increase can be attributed to foreign currency translation effects.  Gross margin as a percent of sales also improved 30 basis points for the year to 29.2%.
 - 
     
Interest expense declined 4% to $1,909 million compared to $1,986 million in the prior year, reflecting the benefits of financial restructuring and debt retirement, partially offset by new project debt with longer maturities.
 - 
     
Income before taxes and minority interest increased 38% to $884 million, compared to $640 million in 2003.
 - 
     
Net cash from operating activities was $1,568 million, or $8 million lower than 2003. In 2004, improved operating income was partially offset by increased working capital related to Eletropaulo's payments for outstanding payables from the period prior to its debt restructuring.
 - 
     
Maintenance capital expenditures were $507 million compared to $542 million in 2003. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) defined as net cash from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures, was $1,061 million in 2004 vs. $1,034 million in 2003.
 - 
     
AES reduced total net debt in 2004 by $1,055 million, including $787 million in recourse parent debt and $268 million in non-recourse subsidiary debt.
 - 
     
Fleet reliability continued to improve year-over-year.  The fleet's annual forced outage factor improved to 4.0% down from 4.6% in 2003.

2005 Earnings Guidance
 
AES expects 2005 diluted earnings per share of $0.76 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.83.  The difference is attributable to expected effects from foreign currency transaction, recourse debt retirement, and derivatives mark-to-market accounting.  The operating scenario underlying this guidance assumes a number of market factors, including foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, tariff increases, new investments, as well as other significant factors which could make actual results vary from this guidance.  Additional guidance elements are presented in the company's 2004 Financial Review and 2005 Outlook presentation
.
"We expect 2005 to be another good year for AES with a continuing and persistent focus on improving the financial performance of our businesses while looking selectively for attractive growth opportunities," Hanrahan said.  "In our generation businesses we expect further improvements in commercial availability and a continued effort to develop platform extension opportunities at our existing businesses.  In our utilities businesses, we will continue to focus our efforts on continued customer service enhancements, tariff and cost management and reducing non-commercial losses. We expect to use our substantial free cash flow to pay down debt and support new growth projects such as our recently announced SeaWest acquisition, our first wind business."

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE(1)
 
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt.  AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, and periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to the 2004 presentation.
(1)
    
 
The Year Ended December 31, 2004 includes $(0.03) related to Chile debt restructuring costs included in interest expense in the first quarter of 2004.

currencies resulting in foreign currency transaction gains or losses on net monetary positions (those of Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina). The prior definition included the effects of all foreign currencies. In addition, only significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments are included. The prior definition included all asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments. Finally, the revised definition reflects the specific tax impact of each amount. The result is no net effect on the adjusted earnings per share for the first half of either 2003 or 2004, with some minor reallocation to the first quarter of both 2003 and 2004, and a $0.03 increase in the annual adjusted EPS for 2003 from $0.53 to $0.56.
NOTE: AES revised the definition of adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2004 to focus greater attention on only three key
 
 
 
 
(1) The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs.
 
(2) AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
