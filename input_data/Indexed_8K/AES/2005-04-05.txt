Certain statements in the following presentation regarding AES's business operations may constitute "forward looking statements."  Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to future earnings, growth and financial and operating performance.  Forward-looking statements are not intended to be a guarantee of future results, but instead constitute AES's current expectations based on reasonable assumptions.  Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions.  These assumptions include, but are not limited to continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies and operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels, as well as achievements of planned productivity improvements and incremental growth from investments at investment levels and rates of return consistent with prior experience. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Important factors that could affect actual results are discussed in AES's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to the risks discussed under the caption "Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors" in AES's most recent annual report on Form 10-K.  Readers are encouraged to read AES's filings to learn more about the risk factors associated with AES's business.  AES undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
We urge investors to read our descriptions and discussions of these risks that are contained under the section "Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2004 as well as our other SEC filings.

endix  Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share
 
($ Per Share)
 
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, and periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to the 2004 presentation.

The year ended December 31, 2004 includes $(0.03) related to Chile debt restructuring costs included in interest expense in the first quarter of 2004.

Such assumptions include, but are not limited to (a) we assume continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies, (b) we assume operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels and in accordance with the provisions of the relevant contracts, (c) we assume achievements of planned productivity improvements, and (d) we assume incremental growth investments at investment levels and rates of return consistent with prior experience.
 
In addition, benefits from global sourcing include avoided cost savings, reduction in capital project costs versus budgetary estimates, and projected savings based on assumed spend volume which may or may not actually be achieved. These benefits will not be fully reflected in the Company's consolidated financial results.
