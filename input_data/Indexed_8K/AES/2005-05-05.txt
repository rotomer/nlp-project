The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) today reported strong first quarter results with income from continuing operations of $133 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.20 in 2005 compared to $74 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.12 in the first quarter of 2004.  Net income of $133 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.20 for 2005 represents an increase of $85 million from $48 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share* were $0.17 per share for the first quarter of 2005 and 2004. The table below summarizes key financial measures for the first quarter of 2005 and 2004.
ARLINGTON, VA., May 5, 2005 
 
 
 
* Adjusted earnings per share, (a non-GAAP financial measure), excludes from diluted earnings per share from continuing operations the effects of gains or losses from mark-to-market accounting adjustments related to derivatives, certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, significant impacts from net asset disposals or impairments and early retirements of recourse debt. See the attached Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share.
 
"We've started the year on a strong operating note.  Our businesses continued to deliver solid performance improvement during the first quarter with all four segments reporting significant increases in revenue and an AES-wide increase in gross margin of $102 million, a 15% increase over 2004", said Paul Hanrahan, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Additionally, in our contract generation segment, we completed the acquisition of SeaWest. We also finalized the Power Purchase Agreement and obtained a support letter from the Bulgarian government for AES to develop, construct and operate the 600 megawatt lignite fired Maritza power project."
 
 
Consolidated Financial Highlights
 
Consolidated key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2005 as compared to the first quarter of 2004 are summarized below:
 
Revenue increased 17% in the first quarter of 2005 with increases in all segments, with particularly strong revenues reported by our large utility business in Brazil (Eletropaulo). Excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased by 14%.
 - 
                 
Gross margin increased 15% driven largely by higher revenues. Gross margin as a percent of sales declined slightly from 30.1% in 2004 to 29.6% in 2005 due to higher fuel costs at our Argentina and Chile businesses, the delay in the tariff increase for our Venezuelan utility partially offset by higher margin earnings from Eletropaulo.
 - 
                 
Interest expense declined $26 million to $467 million from $493 million in 2004 reflecting lower hedge related costs and the benefits of debt retirement at the parent company, partially offset by additional interest on debt related to new projects.
 - 
                 
Income tax expense increased as a result of higher earnings and an increase in our effective tax rate from 32% in 2004 to an estimated 36% in 2005. The estimated rate increase is due to increases in the local taxes imposed on our foreign businesses.
 - 
                 
Income from continuing operations increased 80% to $133 million from $74 million in 2004 due to better operating performance and lower net interest expense, partially offset by increases in minority interest expense related to higher earnings at Eletropaulo.
 - 
                 
 
 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from $0.12 in 2004 to $0.20 in 2005.
 - 
                 
Adjusted earnings per share remained consistent at $0.17 in 2005. Despite the increase in our effective tax rate and higher minority interest expense, improved performance was driven by a 15% increase in gross margin amounts for the first quarter of 2005.
 - 
                 
Net cash from operating activities of $520 million increased $118 million from $402 million in 2004.  Higher year over year earnings, proceeds from the termination of a foreign currency hedge and stable working capital levels contributed to the increase.
 - 
                 
Maintenance capital expenditures were $124 million compared to $122 million in the first quarter of 2004. Free cash flow, (a non-GAAP financial measure), defined as net cash from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures was $396 million in 2005 versus $280 million during the same period in 2004.
 - 
                 
 
Segment Financial Highlights
 
Segment key financial highlights for the first quarter of 2005 compared to the prior year period are summarized below:
 
with 38% of consolidated revenue, increased its revenue by 23% to $1,007 million from $818 million in 2004. Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased 18% for the first quarter of 2005 versus 2004. Gross margin of $252 million increased by 30% from $194 million for the same period in 2004.  Revenue increases were due to improvements in tariffs, including the final realization of prior year tariff increases in Brazil related to lost margin during the 2002 rationing period, favorable foreign currency translation impacts and demand. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased to 25.0% from 23.7% primarily as a result of revenue increases in the quarter, partially offset by higher purchased electricity and other fixed costs and the delay in the Venezuelan tariff increase.
 - 
                 
The Large Utilities segment,
with 14% of consolidated revenue, increased its revenue by 14% to $374 million from $328 million in 2004. Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased 9% for the first quarter of 2005 versus 2004. Gross margin of $73 million increased 16% from $63 million for the same period in 2004. Revenue increases were driven by improvements in tariffs, foreign currency translation impacts and demand. Gross margin as a percent of sales increased slightly to 19.5% from 19.2% primarily as a result of revenue growth in the quarter that was substantially offset by increased variable costs, including purchased electricity costs.
 - 
                 
The Growth Distribution segment,
 
 
with 37% of consolidated revenue, experienced an increase in its revenue of 13% to $985 million from $868 million in 2004 due to higher energy pricing, increased volumes and favorable foreign currency translation impacts.  Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased 11% for the first quarter of 2005 versus 2004. Gross margin of $393 million increased 9% from $359 million. Increases were due to energy pricing gains and increased volumes.  Gross margin as a percent of sales declined to 39.9% in the first quarter of 2005 from 41.4% in 2004 primarily due to higher priced fuel sources in our Chilean business caused by Argentina gas restrictions, increased purchased electricity costs in our Chilean business, as well as decreased contractual capacity payments at one plant in North America.
 - 
                 
The Contract Generation segment,
with 11% of consolidated revenue, increased its revenue by 15% to $279 million from $243 million in 2004. Revenues increased due to higher production volumes, higher realized prices and favorable foreign currency translation impacts.  Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues would have increased 13% for the first quarter of 2005 versus the same quarter in 2004. Gross margin remained at $64 million, similar to the prior year.  Gross margin as a percent of sales declined to 22.9% in the first quarter of 2005 from 26.3% in 2004 primarily due to higher fuel costs in our Argentine plants and forced outages in our New York plants.

The Competitive Supply segment,
 
Outlook
 
AES reaffirmed its 2005 financial guidance which includes diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.76 with adjusted earnings per share of $0.83. The difference is attributable to expected effects from foreign currency transactions, recourse debt retirement, and derivatives mark-to-market accounting. The operating scenario underlying this guidance assumes a number of market factors, including foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, tariff increases, new investments, as well as other significant factors which could make actual results vary from the guidance.  Additional guidance elements are presented in the company's First Quarter 2005 Financial Review Presentation.

RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
(1)
 
(unaudited)
 
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance.  Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, currency transaction gains or losses, periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period, and the early retirement of corporate debt.

The Quarter Ended March 31, 2004 includes $(0.03) related to Chile debt restructuring costs included in interest expense.

(1)  The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside the US.  Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company.  Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside the US.  These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US.  Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs.
 
(2)  AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
