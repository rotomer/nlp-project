Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation
 
As previously announced, Andres and Los Mina, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of AES located in the Dominican Republic, were in default under their $112 million and $24 million respective credit facilities.  On December 15, 2004, both Andres and Los Mina entered into forbearance agreements with their respective lenders pursuant to which Andres and Los Mina agreed to pay interest when due under the facilities and the lenders agreed not to exercise any remedies under the respective credit agreements.  These forbearance agreements expired on June 10, 2005.  On June 16, 2005, Andres entered into an agreement with its lenders to extend its forbearance agreement until July 30, 2005.    Andres is in negotiations with the lenders under its credit agreement to amend the facility.    As of May 31, 2005, the unaudited net assets of Andres were $311 million.  While an extension of the forbearance agreement for Los Mina has not been executed, Los Mina is currently involved in discussions with its lenders.    As of May 31, 2005 the unaudited net assets of Los Mina were $92 million.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
