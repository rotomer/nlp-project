Exhibit 99.1
 
ARLINGTON, VA., June 28, 2005 
 
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES)
today announced it has amended its $650 million credit facilities to significantly reduce borrowing costs.
 
The interest rate on the $450 million revolving credit facility has been reduced to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 175 basis points. Previously, the rate was LIBOR plus 250 basis points. In addition, the revolving credit facility maturity date was extended from 2007 to 2010. The interest rate on the term loan facility also was reduced to LIBOR plus 175, from LIBOR plus 225, while its maturity in 2011 remains unchanged. At May 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under the $450 million revolving credit facility, but approximately $179 million was utilized for letters of credit supporting general business purposes, while the $200 million term loan was fully drawn. AES retains the right to prepay without penalty under these facilities at any time.
 
"This amendment demonstrates that the financial markets continue to recognize AES's improving credit quality. It reflects the benefits of our deleveraging strategy and our improved financial performance," said AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Barry Sharp.
