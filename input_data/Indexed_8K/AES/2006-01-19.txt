Certain statements in the following presentation regarding AES's business operations may constitute "forward looking statements." Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to future earnings, growth and financial and operating performance.  Forward-looking statements are not intended to be a guarantee of future results, but instead constitute AES's current expectations based on reasonable assumptions.  Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions.  These assumptions include, but are not limited to continued normal or better levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies and operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels, as well as achievements of planned productivity improvements and incremental growth from investments at investment levels and rates of return consistent with prior experience. For additional assumptions see the Appendix to this presentation. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Important factors that could affect actual results are discussed in AES's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to the risks discussed under the caption "Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004, as well as our other SEC filings. AES undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Revenues grew as a result of increased contract pricing in Brazil and Chile, higher dispatch in Chile and at our new Ras Laffan project in Qatar, and favorable currency effects largely in Chile and Brazil.  These positive effects were partially offset by a scheduled contract price reduction in the U.S.
 - 
                 
 
Gross margin increased primarily as a result of higher revenues.  The decline in gross margin percentage was driven by higher fuel and energy purchase costs in Chile and the scheduled contract price reduction in the U.S.

Re
statement Summary Income Statement Effects 2002-2004
 
($ Millions)
 
 
Revenue was impacted by the deferral of revenue at Eletropaulo and Sul to correctly match the earning of revenue with the expenditures required by the regulator in relation to its energy efficiency program. In addition, revenue was adjusted for the correction of certain acquisition liabilities related to the Cameroonian utility. These liabilities impacted the initial valuation of the "concession asset" which represented excess purchase cost over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. This concession asset is amortized through revenue.
(1)
    
 
Depreciation expense was impacted by changes in deferred tax balances as of the acquisition date of certain subsidiaries. These deferred tax adjustments in turn affected the amount of excess purchase cost originally allocated to fixed assets, thus impacting subsequent depreciation amounts.
(2)
    
 
Interest expense was impacted primarily by the correct accounting for changes in inflation on certain Brazilian debt instruments.
(3)
    
 
Goodwill impairment expense was impacted by the correction of acquisition deferred tax balances, which adjusted the acquired entity's excess fair value over identifiable assets or liabilities (goodwill). For certain of these subsidiaries, goodwill subsequent to the acquisition was impaired and written off in 2002. Therefore the corrections to the goodwill balances were also written off.
(4)
    
 
Foreign currency translation gains (losses) were impacted by the correct remeasurement of deferred tax balances at current rates at entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.
(5)
    
 
Income tax expense was impacted by the creation and subsequent adjustment of deferred tax assets or liabilities related to the foreign currency changes on U.S. dollar denominated debt at certain Brazilian subsidiaries; the recording of an adjustment related to Sul (a dual tax status entity) recognizing the tax impact of potential future foreign income included in the U.S. return; the creation of additional valuation allowances; and the reconciliation of deferred tax balances as a result of reconciling tax return records to related accounting records.
(6)
    
 
Minority interest (income) expense was impacted by tax and other corrections to minority owned subsidiaries' earnings.

As
sumptions
 
Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions.  These assumptions include, but are not limited to continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies and operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels.
 
The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the U.S.  Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company.  Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the U.S.  These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the U.S.  Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs.
 
AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
De
finitions of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure), exclude from diluted earnings per share from continuing operations the effects of (i) gains or losses from mark-to-market accounting adjustments related to derivatives, (ii) certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, (iii) significant impacts from net asset disposals or impairments, and(iv) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, and periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period.
 - 
                 
 
Free cash flow  Net cash flow from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures.
 - 
                 
 
Liquidity  Cash at the parent company plus availability under corporate revolver plus cash at qualifying holding companies (QHCs).
 - 
                 
 
Maintenance capital expenditures  reflect property additions less growth capital expenditures.
 - 
                 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC)  Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by average capital. NOPAT is defined as income before tax and minority expense plus interest expense less income taxes less tax benefit on interest expense at effective tax rate. Average capital is defined as the average of beginning and ending total debt plus minority interest plus shareholders equity less debt service reserves.
 - 
                 
 
Subsidiary Distributions  Cash distributions (primarily dividends and interest income) from subsidiary companies to the parent company and qualified holding companies. These cash flows are the source of cash flow to the parent to meet corporate interest, overhead, cash taxes, and discretionary uses such as recourse debt reductions and corporate investments.

pendix - Assumptions
Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions.  Such assumptions include, but are not limited to: 1) no unforeseen external events such as wars, depressions, or economic or political disruptions occur; 2) businesses continue to operate in a manner consistent with or better than prior operating performance, including achievement of planned productivity improvements including benefits of global sourcing, and in accordance with the provisions of their relevant contracts or concessions; 3) new business opportunities are available to AES in sufficient quantity so that AES can capture its historical market share; 4) no major disruptions or discontinuities occur in GDP, foreign exchange rates, inflation or interest rates during the forecast period; 5) negative factors do not combine to create highly negative low-probability business situations; 6) business-specific risks as described in the Company's SEC filings do not occur.
 
In addition, benefits from global sourcing include avoided costs, reduction in capital project costs versus budgetary estimates, and projected savings based on assumed spend volume which may or may not actually be achieved. These benefits will not be fully reflected in the Company's consolidated financial results.

pendix  Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings Per Share
 
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, and periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to the 2004 presentation.
