Item 1.01
                         
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
This Form 8-K is to describe ordinary course named executive officer compensation actions taken by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation (the "Board") as ratified and approved by the Board.
 
On February 23, 2006, the Committee took the following actions with respect to the compensation of The AES Corporation (the "Company") named executive officers (as defined in Regulation S-K item 402(a)(3)) and such actions were approved by the Board and effective as of February 24, 2006:
 
 
Annual bonuses to be paid to named executive officers in 2006 for performance during 2005 were based on 2005 performance in the following areas: 40% on business or corporate cash flow targets, 25% on performance improvement targets, 25% on achievement of individual objectives and 10% on safety performance.
(1)
                                 
 
Pay out will occur if the applicable continued employment conditions are satisfied and the Total Stockholder Return ("TSR") on AES common stock exceeds the TSR of the Standard and Poor's 500 ("S&P 500") over the three year measurement period beginning on January 1, 2006 and ending on December 31, 2008. If these conditions are met, the actual payout of the Restricted Stock Units would occur in 2011. In situations where the TSR of both AES common stock and the S&P 500 exhibit a gain over the measurement period, the Compensation Committee has the discretion under certain circumstances, but is not required, to permit this grant to vest without the TSR of AES stock exceeding the TSR of the S&P 500.
(2)
                                 
 
Each stock option has an exercise price of $17.58 representing the closing price of a share of AES common stock on the NYSE composite tape on the date of grant. The options will vest in three-equal installments on each anniversary following the date of grant, provided that applicable continued employment conditions are satisfied.
(3)
                                 
On February 24, 2006, the Board approved Long-Term Performance Unit awards to the named executive officers. Such awards will vest in three equal annual installments provided that applicable continued employment conditions are satisfied. Each Long Term Performance Unit will have an initial value of $1 and will be valued at the end of the three year performance period, beginning on January 1, 2005 and ending on December 31, 2007, from $0 to $2.00 depending upon the Company's actual performance over the performance period as measured by "Cash Value Added" ("CVA"). Any pay out of the Long Term Performance Units will be paid in cash to the holder.
(4)
                                 
 
As previously announced by the Company, on January 20, 2006 Victoria D. Harker replaced Barry J. Sharp as Chief Financial Officer.
(5)
                                 
 
The Company announced on March 2, 2006 that Mr. Ruggirello is leaving the Company as of March 31, 2006.
