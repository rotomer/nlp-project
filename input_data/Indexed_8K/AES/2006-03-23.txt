Sa
fe Harbor Disclosure
 
Certain statements in the following presentation regarding AES's business operations may constitute "forward looking statements." Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to future earnings, growth and financial and operating performance. Forward-looking statements are not intended to be a guarantee of future results, but instead constitute AES's current expectations based on reasonable assumptions. Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to continued normal or better levels of operating performance and electricity demand at our distribution companies and operational performance at our contract generation businesses consistent with historical levels, as well as achievements of planned productivity improvements and incremental growth from investments at investment levels and rates of return consistent with prior experience. For additional assumptions see the Appendix to this presentation. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Important factors that could affect actual results are discussed in AES's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to the risks discussed under the caption "Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors" in the Company's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, as well as our other SEC filings. AES undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

day's Agenda
 
Ap
pendix - Assumptions
 
Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to: 1) no unforeseen external events such as wars, depressions, or economic or political disruptions occur; 2 ) businesses continue to operate in a manner consistent with or better than prior operating performance, including achievement of planned productivity improvements including benefits of global sourcing, and in accordance with the provisions of their relevant contracts or concessions; 3) new business opportunities are available to AES in sufficient quantity so that AES can capture its historical market share; 4) no major disruptions or discontinuities occur in GDP, foreign exchange rates, inflation or interest rates during the forecast period; 5) negative factors do not combine to create highly negative low-probability business situations; 6) business-specific risks as described in the Company's SEC filings do not occur.
 
In addition, benefits from global sourcing include avoided costs, reduction in capital project costs versus budgetary estimates, and projected savings based on assumed spend volume which may or may not actually be achieved. These benefits will not be fully reflected in the Company's consolidated financial results.
Ap
pendix - Definitions
 
Free Cash Flow - Net cash from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures reflect property additions less growth capital expenditures.
 - 
                 
 
Lost Time Accident (LTA) - An incident in which the injured person is kept away from work beyond the day of the incident.
 - 
                 
 
Near Miss - An incident that occurred but did not result in any injury. In AES, we have expanded this to include unsafe conditions that have been observed.
 - 
                 
 
O&M - - Operation and maintenance.
 - 
                 
 
Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) - An integrated maintenance methodology that optimizes among reactive, interval-based, condition-based, and proactive maintenance practices to take advantage of their respective strengths in order to maximize facility and equipment reliability while minimizing life-cycle costs.
 - 
                 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) - Defined as net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by average capital. NOPAT is defined as income before tax and minority expense plus interest expense less income taxes less tax benefit on interest expense at effective tax rate. Average capital is defined as the average of beginning and ending total debt plus minority interest plus stockholders' equity less debt service reserves and other restricted deposits.
 - 
                 
 
System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) - A measure of the cumulative duration of electric service forced and sustained interruptions experienced by customers each year, excluding  "force majeure" events. SAIDI is calculated as the total number of customer minutes of sustained interruption divided by the number of customers served.
 - 
                 
 
System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) - A measure of the number of outages per customer per year. SAIFI is calculated by dividing the total number of customer-sustained interruptions by the number of customers served.
 -

Note: On the regional financial slides included subsequently in this presentation series, subsidiary distributions to parent, which exclude returns of capital and project financing proceeds, have been referred to as "Distributions to AES Corporation."

Biomass is now being co-fired at the Kilroot power station in Northern Ireland
 - 
                 
In burning biomass the business is able to generate a revenue stream through its generation of renewables credits'
 - 
                 
In addition, the energy produced does not require the allocation of CO allowances
 -

With a minimal capital investment from AES, the station can now burn up to 6% biomass by volume
 - 
                 
This initiative is expected to contribute positively from 2006
 - 
                 
The business is exploring the possibility of increasing its biomass % consumption by burning palm oil
