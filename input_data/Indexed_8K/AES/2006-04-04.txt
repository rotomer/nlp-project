Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associate with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction gains and losses on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, currency transaction gains or losses, periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period, and the early retirement of corporate debt.

Segment Highlights
 
Revenues grew as a result of favorable currency effects in Brazil and higher tariffs in Brazil and Argentina.
 - 
                 
 
Gross margin and gross margin as a percent of sales increased due to revenue gains, favorable currency translation impacts and lower purchased electricity costs, offset by unfavorable fixed cost comparisons.
 - 
                 
 
Fourth Quarter Segment Highlights
Contract Generation
 
($ Millions Except As Noted)
 
 
 
Segment Highlights
 
Revenues grew as a result of increased contract pricing and dispatch in Chile, higher contract pricing in the Dominican Republic and higher dispatch in China and Pakistan. These positive effects were partially offset by a scheduled contract price reduction at Shady Point and an outage at Thames in the U.S.
 - 
                 
 
Gross margin increased primarily as a result of higher revenues. The decline in gross margin percentage is driven by higher fuel costs throughout the businesses along with the contract reduction and outage in the U.S.

Assumptions
 
Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to: (a) no unforeseen external events such as wars, depressions, or economic or political disruptions occur; (b) businesses continue to operate in a manner consistent with or better than prior operating performance, including achievement of planned productivity improvements including benefits of global sourcing, and in accordance with the provisions of their relevant contracts or concessions; (c) new business opportunities are available to AES in sufficient quantity so that AES can capture its historical market share or increase its share; (d) no material disruptions or discontinuities occur in GDP, foreign exchange rates, inflation or interest rates during the forecast period; (e) negative factors do not combine to create highly negative low-probability business situations; (f) material business-specific risks as described in the Company's SEC filings do not occur. In addition, benefits from global sourcing include avoided costs, reduction in capital project costs versus budgetary estimates, and projected savings based on assumed spend volume which may or may not actually be achieved. Also, improvement in certain KPIs such as EFOR and commercial availability may not improve financial performance at all facilities based on commercial terms and conditions. These benefits will not be fully reflected in the Company's consolidated financial results.
 
The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the parent company. Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the U.S. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the U.S. Since the cash held by these qualifying holding companies is available to the parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to parent and qualified holding companies as a useful measure of cash available to the parent to meet its international liquidity needs. AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
 
Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure), is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and are considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, currency gains and losses, periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period, and the early retirement of corporate debt.
 - 
                 
 
Free cash flow  Net cash flow from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures reflect property additions less growth capital expenditures.
 - 
                 
 
Liquidity  Cash at the parent company plus availability under corporate revolver plus cash at qualifying holding companies (QHCs).
 - 
                 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC)  Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) divided by average capital. NOPAT is defined as income before tax and minority expense plus interest expense less income taxes less tax benefit on interest expense at effective tax rate. Average capital is defined as the average of beginning and ending total debt plus minority interest plus stockholders' equity less debt service reserves and other deposits.
 - 
                 
 
Subsidiary Distributions  Cash distributions (primarily dividends and interest income) from subsidiary companies to the parent company and qualified holding companies. These cash flows are the source of cash flow to the parent to meet corporate interest, overhead, cash taxes, and discretionary uses such as recourse debt reductions and corporate investments.

Net operating profit after tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as income before tax and minority interest expense (IBT&MI) plus interest expense less income taxes less tax benefit on interest expense at the effective tax rate.
(1)
         
Income tax expense calculated by multiplying the sum of IBT&MI and reported interest expense for the period by the effective tax rate for the period.
(2)
         
Effective tax rate calculated by dividing reported income tax expense for the period by IBT&MI for the period.
(3)
         
Return on invested capital (ROIC), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net operating profit after tax divided by average capital calculated over rolling 12 month basis.
(4)
         
Total capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as total debt plus minority interest plus stockholders' equity less debt service reserves.
(5)
         
Average capital is defined as the average of beginning and ending total capital over the last 12 months.

Appendix - - Assumptions
Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to: 1) no unforeseen external events such as wars, depressions, or economic or political disruptions occur; 2 ) businesses continue to operate in a manner consistent with or better than prior operating performance, including achievement of planned productivity improvements including benefits of global sourcing, and in accordance with the provisions of their relevant contracts or concessions; 3) new business opportunities are available to AES in sufficient quantity so that AES can capture its historical market share or increase its share; 4) no material disruptions or discontinuities occur in GDP, foreign exchange rates, inflation or interest rates during the forecast period; 5)  negative factors do not combine to create highly negative low-probability business situations; 6) material business-specific risks as described in the Company's SEC filings do not occur.
 
In addition, benefits from global sourcing include avoided costs, reduction in capital project costs versus budgetary estimates, and projected savings based on assumed spend volume, which may or may not actually be achieved. Also, improvement in certain KPIs such as EFOR and commercial availability may not improve financial performance at all facilities based on commercial terms and conditions. These benefits will not be fully reflected in the Company's consolidated financial results.
