AES REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER RESULTS; RAISES GUIDANCE Revenue, Earnings and Cash Flow Show Double-Digit Growth; Company Now Sees Higher Revenues and Earnings in 2006
 
The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) today reported continued growth in revenues and earnings for the second quarter of 2006. Revenues increased 15% to $3.0 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2005, and net income increased 99% to $169 million, compared to $85 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.25 compared to $0.13 for the same quarter last year, while diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.31 compared to $0.13 last year. Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) were $0.29 compared to $0.12 last year. See the attached Reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings per Share for further information.
ARLINGTON, VA., August 7, 2006
Net cash from operating activities increased 32% to $434 million in the second quarter, compared to $328 million last year, while free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 34% to $243 million compared to $182 million last year. See Second Quarter Financial Highlights for further information.
The Company sees higher revenues and earnings in 2006, and has raised its guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $1.05 from $0.96 previously and for adjusted earnings per share to $1.01 from $0.97 previously. See the attached 2006 Financial Guidance Update for further information.
"We had a strong quarter and AES continues to perform well," said Paul Hanrahan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Earnings continued to benefit from solid operating price and volume trends. The good earnings gains were also reflected in solid cash flow growth, consistent with our guidance. In the area of business development, we increased our presence in alternative energy by expanding into some of the fastest growing markets for wind generation in the U.S. and Europe, and through the recentcreation of AES AgriVerdeour first significant business venture in the greenhouse gas offset production sectorwhich should allow us to capitalize on the growing market for greenhouse gas emissions reductions."

Results for the second quarter reflect the Company's plans to sell its 140 MW Indian Queens power generation plant in the U.K. and Eden, a regulated utility in Argentina. These operations have been recorded as discontinued operations in the second quarter 2006 results. Comparisons with prior periods have been adjusted to include the results from those businesses in discontinued operations.
Financial Summary
The following table summarizes key financial measures for the three months and six months which ended June 30, 2006 and for prior year periods:
($ in millions except per share amounts)
 
Second Quarter Financial Highlights
Consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter of 2006 compared to the second quarter of 2005 are summarized below:
2
Revenues increased 15% to $3,038 million, with gains in all segments. Revenues increased approximately 10% excluding estimated foreign currency translation impacts, a result of higher prices in all segments and higher volume principally in our Contract Generation segment.
                 
Gross margin increased 75% to $919 million. This higher than usual increase was partially attributable to comparisons with an uncharacteristically low second quarter in 2005, which was impacted by a $192 million receivables reserve expense recorded in Brazil. The increase over the same period in 2005 also reflects higher prices and volume. Gross margin as a percent of revenues improved to 30.3% from 19.9% in the prior year largely due to the adverse impact of the 2005 Brazil receivables reserve expense.
                 
General and administrative expenses increased 31% to $59 million primarily due to increased corporate staffing and a higher level of business development activities.
                 
Interest expense decreased 7% to $442 million primarily due to debt reduction and mark to market gains on interest rate derivatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.
                 
Net other expense was $49 million in the quarter compared to net other income of $67 million in the prior year quarter. Net other income in the 2005 period included $70 million of income from the reversal of a Brazil business tax accrual no longer required. Net other expense in the second quarter of 2006 included $20 million for liquidated damages payable to the electricity offtaker for delays in the construction of our 1,200 MW power plant in Spain.
                 
Income tax expense increased to $106 million from $80 million, but the effective tax rate fell to 22% compared to 43% in last year's second quarter.  The reduction in the effective tax rate was due, in part, to the favorable: (1) release of a $43 million valuation allowance at Eletropaulo in Brazil, related to its deferred tax asset for certain pension obligations; (2) decrease in tax expense on unrealized foreign currency gains associated with U.S. dollar debt held at certain Latin American subsidiaries and; (3) decrease in U.S. taxes on distributions from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries due to recent changes in U.S. tax law.
                 
Minority interest expense was $166 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter last year. The increase resulted principally from higher after tax earnings in Brazil. Comparisons were also impacted by the second quarter 2005 Brazil receivables reserve expense, which reduced minority expense in that period.
                 
Income from continuing operations increased 143% to $211 million from $87 million in the second quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 138% to $0.31 compared to $0.13 per diluted share in the 2005 second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share increased 142% to $0.29 compared to $0.12 in the 2005 quarter.
                 
Net income for the second quarter included a $63 million loss associated with discontinued operations and a $21 million extraordinary gain from the purchase of an additional 25% interest in Itabo, a contract generation business in the Dominican Republic, at a price which was less than the fair value of the assets acquired.
                 
Net cash from operating activities increased 32% to $434 million compared to $328 million in the second quarter of 2005.
                 
3
Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net cash from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures) was $243 million, 34% above the $182 million recorded in the same period last year. Property additions totaled $361 million in the quarter, including $191 million in maintenance capital and $170 million in growth capital expenditures. For the 2005 quarter, property additions were $260 million, including $146 million in maintenance capital and $114 million in growth capital expenditures.
                 
Segment Financial Highlights
Regulated Utilities segment revenues increased 9% to $1,506 million from $1,376 million in the second quarter of 2005. Excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues increased approximately 1%, primarily due to higher average prices in North America related to higher fuel charges, largely offset by higher intercompany revenues in Latin America which are eliminated in the segment. Gross margin increased 264% to $408 million primarily due to the 2005 Brazil receivables reserve expense and favorable foreign currency translation effects in 2006. Gross margin as a percent of revenues increased to 27.1% from 8.1% primarily due to last year's receivables reserve expense.
                 
Contract Generation segment revenues increased 21% to $1,199 million from $988 million in the second quarter of 2005 due largely to higher volume in Pakistan and favorable volume and prices in Brazil and Chile, together with the consolidation of Itabo in the Dominican Republic as a result of an increase in ownership during the quarter. Foreign currency translation effects were not significant in the quarter. Gross margin improved 18% to $415 million, due principally to higher volume and prices in Brazil and Chile partially offset by higher maintenance expense in the U.S. Gross margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 34.6% from 35.7% primarily due to higher volume in Pakistan and the higher maintenance costs in the U.S.
                 
Competitive Supply segment revenues grew 17% to $333 million from $285 million in the second quarter of 2005, and approximately 18% excluding the estimated impacts of foreign currency translation, primarily reflecting higher prices and volume in New York, higher prices in Argentina and higher volume and prices in Kazakhstan. This was partially offset by lower emission allowance sales of $7 million in New York compared to $27 million in last year's second quarter. Gross margin increased 57% to $96 million, primarily reflecting the higher prices and partially offset by the lower emission allowance sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenues increased to 28.8% from 21.4% largely due to the improved pricing.
                 
Six Month Financial Highlights
Consolidated key financial highlights for the six months ending June 30, 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005 are summarized below:
4
Revenues increased 14% to $6,020 million, with gains in all segments. Revenues increased approximately 9% excluding estimated foreign currency translation impacts, a result of higher prices in all segments, higher volume principally in our Contract Generation segment and the sale of $73 million in excess environmental emission allowances compared to $30 million last year.
                 
Gross margin increased 39% to
                 
$1,870 million, which was impacted by the second quarter 2005 Brazil receivables reserve expense together with second quarter 2006 benefits from higher prices, volume and emission allowance sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenues improved to 31.1% from 25.5% primarily due to last year's receivables reserve expense along with this year's allowance sales increase.
General and administrative expenses increased 21% to $114 million primarily due to a higher level of business development activities and other consulting costs.
                 
Interest expense fell 7% to $874 million, primarily due to debt reduction, mark to market gains on interest rate derivatives and lower interest rates in Venezuela, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects.
                 
Interest income increased 13% to $206 million primarily due to a $17 million benefit in the first quarter of 2006 related to the settlement of receivables in the Dominican Republic, favorable foreign currency translation effects in Brazil, and higher cash and short-term investments in Chile and Brazil, partially offset by less interest earned on regulatory assets in Brazil.
                 
Net other expense was $97 million in the first half of 2006 compared to net other income of $52 million in the prior year period. Net other income in the 2005 period included $70 million of income from the reversal of a Brazil business tax accrual. Net other expense in the 2006 period included $62 million in losses on parent debt retirement and El Salvador subsidiary debt extinguishment and $20 million for liquidated damages related to construction delays in our project in Spain, partially offset by a $14 million gain from retiring debt at a discount in Argentina.
                 
Gain on sale of investments for the 2006 period included an $87 million pre-tax gain on the sale of an investment in a Canadian equity affiliate.
                 
Equity earnings in the 2006 period increased 28% to $59 million. The 2006 period results included a first quarter net $16 million gain related to the successful resolution of a legal claim at AES Barry in the UK.
                 
Income tax expense increased to $296 million versus $227 million in the prior year period, but the effective tax rate fell to 27%, compared to 40% for the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the 2006 period was impacted favorably by: (1) release of a $43 million valuation allowance at Eletropaulo in Brazil related to its deferred tax asset for certain pension obligations; (2) a decrease in tax expense on unrealized foreign currency gains associated with U.S. dollar debt held at certain Latin American subsidiaries; (3) a decrease in U.S. taxes on distributions from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries due to recent changes in U.S. tax law and; (4) the sale of the Canadian equity affiliate, the gain on which was not taxable.
                 
5
Minority interest was $254 million compared to $125 million in the first half of last year. Comparisons were impacted by the 2005 Brazil receivables reserve expense, which reduced minority interest in that period.
                 
Income from continuing operations increased 171% to $566 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.85 from $0.31 in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share increased 148% to $0.72 from $0.29 last year.
                 
Net income for the period included a $67 million loss associated with discontinued operations and a $21 million extraordinary gain from the valuation of the additional interest acquired in Itabo.
                 
Net cash from operating activities increased 16% to $977 million compared to $845 million last year.
                 
Free cash flow increased 6% to $611 million from $575 million recorded in the same period last yearProperty additions totaled $593 million in the first half of 2006, including $366 million in maintenance capital and $227 million in growth capital expenditures and investments. For the 2005 period, property additions were $531 million, including $270 million in maintenance capital and $261 million in growth capital expenditures.

2006 Financial Guidance Update
The Company expects higher revenues and operating results for the year and has increased its guidance for both diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $1.05 from $0.96 previously, and for adjusted earnings per share to $1.01 from $0.97 previously. The distinction between diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share guidance is that adjusted earnings per share excludes the expected net effects from derivative mark to market accounting, corporate debt repayment, certain portfolio management transactions, and gains or losses from certain foreign currency transactions. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and is used in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. See the attached 2006 Financial Guidance Update for further information.
It does not include any adverse financial impact from the proposed restructuring of Brasiliana Energia, a holding company in Brazil.
The operating scenario underlying this guidance assumes a number of factors, including effective tax rate, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, tariff increases, new investments, and other significant factors which could make actual results vary from the guidance.

THE AES CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark to market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) costs related to the early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance.  Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, currency transaction gains or losses, periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period, and the early retirement of corporate debt.

Liquidity (2)
($in millions)
 
The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company (Parent). Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the U.S.  These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the U.S.  Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.

AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
