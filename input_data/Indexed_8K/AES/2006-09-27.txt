Item 7.01       Regulation FD Disclosure
        The AES Corporation announced that AES Transgs Empreendimentos S.A.(Transgs), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brasiliana Energia S.A. (Brasiliana), expects to close today a secondary offering of preferred stock representing approximately 33% of Eletropaulo Metropolitana Eletricidade de So Paulo S.A. (Eletropaulo), a regulated electric utility in Brazil. Brasiliana is jointly owned by AES and the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES). Following completion of the transaction, AES will maintain its controlling interest in Eletropaulo and will have an economic interest of approximately 18% in Eletropaulo (approximately 16% if the over-allotment option is fully exercised). Proceeds from the secondary offering are expected to be approximately $530 million (up to approximately $610 million at current exchange rates if the over-allotment option is fully exercised) and will be used to repay debt owed to BNDES, which was $595 million as of June 30, 2006. AES expects these transactions to result in an after-tax charge to 2006 earnings, primarily related to the non-cash realization of cumulative currency translation losses associated with its investment in Eletropaulo. Excluding this charge, AES sees no change to its 2006 earnings guidance, due to the limited recurring impact in the remainder of this year.
