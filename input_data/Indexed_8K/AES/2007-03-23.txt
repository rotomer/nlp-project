Item 8.01
           
On March 19, 2007, the AES Corporation (the " Company") announced that as of March 16, 2007 it was in default under its senior bank credit facility and its $600 million senior unsecured credit facility.  In addition, the Company needed to obtain a waiver of default for each of these respective credit facilities before the Company could borrow additional funds thereunder.
On March 22, 2007, the Company obtained the necessary votes from a majority of its lenders under both the senior bank facility and the senior unsecured credit facility, to waive the respective events of default described above.  Waivers have been executed with respect to each credit facility.  Please see a copy of the amendment and waiver to the senior bank credit facility attached as Exhibit 99.1 and a copy of the waiver to the senior unsecured credit facility attached as Exhibit 99.2.  Because the Company has obtained these waivers, the Company now has access to the credit available under its senior bank facility and senior unsecured credit facility.
