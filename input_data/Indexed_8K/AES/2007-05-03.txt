Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
    
On May 1, 2007, the AES Trust VII (the "Trust VII"), a subsidiary of the AES Corporation (the "Company"), received a written notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market (the "Nasdaq Notice") stating that the Trust VII's Trust Convertible Preferred Securities (OTCCB symbol: AESRO) will be delisted from the OTC Bulletin Board effective May 3, 2007 due to non-compliance with NASD Rule 6530 as a result of the Company's failure to timely file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006.  The decision to delist the Convertible Preferred Securities was made following a telephonic hearing by the Company before the Hearings Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market on April 27, 2007.  The Company has not determined whether it will cause a Form 211 to be filed to list the Convertible Preferred Securities on the OTC Bulletin Board after it has filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the Securities Exchange Commission.
