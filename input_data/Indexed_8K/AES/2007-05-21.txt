2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On February 27, 2007, The AES Corporation ("AES" or the "Company") filed a Form 8-K disclosing that AES entered into a definitive agreement (the "Agreement") with Petrleos de Venezuela, S.A, ("PDVSA"), pursuant to which AES agreed to sell to PDVSA all of its shares of C.A. La Electricidad de Caracas ("EDC") in a tender offer.
On April 9, 2007, PDVSA commenced its tender offer for the EDC shares.  On May 4, 2007, AES and one of its subsidiaries tendered their EDC shares to PDVSA.  On May 8, the tender offer expired, and, on May 16, the Company received approximately $739,176,000 in proceeds from the tender.
On March 16, 2007, prior to the commencement of the tender offer, AES received the equivalent of approximately $99 million in local currency as its share of EDC's dividend.  Under the terms of the Agreement, this dividend will be converted into dollars at the official exchange rate within 90 days of the dividend payment date. 
Prior to the tender, AES and its subsidiaries owned 82.14% of the outstanding shares of EDC.  EDC is the largest private electric utility in Venezuela. It is a provider of power and light to approximately one million customers in the Caracas metropolitan area. EDC also owns and operates five generation plants with a total of 2,616 MW of generation capacity. These facilities collectively represent approximately 14% of the electricity consumed in Venezuela.
