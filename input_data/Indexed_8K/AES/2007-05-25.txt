Expects Continued Growth in Core Business and Emphasis on Alternative Energy
Arlington, VA, May 25, 2007  The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) today announced its long term financial guidance through 2011.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to increase from 2007 guidance of $1.04 to between $1.75 and $2.15 in 2011, yielding a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of between 14% and 20%. Net cash flow from operating activities is expected to increase from $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion in 2007 to between $3 billion and $4 billion in 2011, an increase of between 30% and 74%. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) is expected to increase from between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in 2007 to between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion in 2011, an increase of between 64% and 136%. Subsidiary distributions (a non-GAAP financial measure) are expected to increase from $1.1 billion in 2007 to between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion in 2011, an increase of between 36% and 127%. The company's estimates for diluted earnings per share, net operating cash flow, free cash flow and subsidiary distributions for 2008 through 2011 are attached.
"We continue to see AES delivering strong long-term earnings growth, through our business development pipeline and investment in new and adjacent markets," said AES President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanrahan.  "Alternative energy is a promising sector within the energy industry and will be an important driver in our overall growth strategy. We also will continue to deliver long-term earnings growth from our core power business, by focusing our expansion efforts on markets with a growing demand for power."
In its core power business, AES plans to expand its current base of 40,000 MW worldwide to up to 46,500 MW by 2011.  The Company currently has five power plants under construction totaling 1,682 MW in four countries and 20,000 MW of potential new greenfield power plants worldwide in its development pipeline.  AES will focus its expansion in selected markets where it currently has a significant presence or in new markets that have a high growth potential through platform expansions, selective acquisitions and other new projects.
In the area of alternative energy, the Company plans to more than triple its wind capacity over the next four years by adding approximately 2,100 MW in new wind generation worldwide by 2011.  The Company today has 600 MW of wind generation in operations, one 233 MW power plant under construction and 3,000 MW of wind projects in various stages of development throughout the world.  In the emerging greenhouse gas emission offset industry, the Company has targeted a production level of up to 26 million tons per year of tradable offsets, or Certified Emission Reductions, by 2011.
