Item 2.06  Material Impairments
On June 14, 2007, the Financial Audit Committee of The AES Corporation (the "Company") determined that the Company's equity investment in AgCert International ("AgCert"), a United Kingdom company, has been impaired.  The equity investment in AgCert, which was made in May of 2006, was in the form of publicly traded securities classified as "available-for-sale" under generally accepted accounting principles. The Company determined, based upon the current value of these publicly traded securities, that its investment in AgCert had suffered an "other than temporary" decline in price.  As prescribed by general accepted accounting principles, the Company therefore recorded an impairment charge of $35 million in its financial statements ending March 31, 2006. The Company does not expect that the impairment will result in future cash expenditures.
