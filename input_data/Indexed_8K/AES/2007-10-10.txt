Arlington, VA, October 10, 2007  The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today
 
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes primarily to refinance a portion of its recourse debt. However, depending on the timing of the sources and uses of parent-level funds, up to $600 million of the net proceeds may be used to support the Company's near-term investment requirements, such as the potential purchase of the Brazilian National Development Bank's (BNDES) interest in Brasiliana and anticipated investments in the Philippines, South Africa and Northern Ireland, or for general corporate purposes. As previously disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K/A dated August 7, 2007, AES has a right of first refusal under the Brasiliana shareholders' agreement to acquire BNDES's interest in Brasiliana. BNDES has begun the process to sell its interest in Brasiliana.  The Company may also use its internally-generated free cash flow, additional financing transactions and portfolio management transactions, including (but not limited to) asset sales and subsidiary recapitalization transactions to fund its investments and for the refinancing of its recourse debt.
 
The senior notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities laws.  Therefore, the senior notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and any applicable securities laws.  This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the senior notes.
