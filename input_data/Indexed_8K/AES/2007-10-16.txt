ARLINGTON, VA., October 16, 2007  The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today announced that it has commenced a cash tender offer for up to $1.24 billion (the "Tender Cap") of its outstanding senior notes listed in the table below (the "Notes") in accordance with the terms and conditions described in its Offer to Purchase dated October 16, 2007.  The tender offer will expire at 12:00 p.m. midnight, New York City time, on November 13, 2007, unless extended or earlier terminated (such time, as the same may be extended or earlier terminated, the "Expiration Time").
The total consideration payable for each series of Notes will be based on the yield to maturity of a specified U.S. Treasury reference security, plus a fixed spread.  The table below shows, among other things, the three series of Notes subject to the tender offer, the acceptance priority levels, the applicable U.S. treasury reference security for the Notes and the applicable fixed spread:
 
 
The 2008 Notes mature on June 15, 2008 and may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price equal to par plus a "make-whole" premium, if any.
1.
                                      
May 15, 2008 is the earliest date at which the 2013 Notes and the 2015 Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to a specified percentage of the principal amount.  Prior to May 15, 2008, the 2013 Notes and 2015 Notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price equal to par plus a "make-whole" premium, if any.
2.
                                      
Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes that are accepted for purchase.
3.
                                      
Holders tendering their Notes on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 29, 2007, unless extended or earlier terminated (the "Early Tender Time"), will receive the total consideration, which includes an early tender premium of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes purchased.  Holders that tender their Notes after the Early Tender Time but prior to the Expiration Time will receive the total consideration less the early tender premium (the "Tender Offer Consideration").  The Company will pay the total consideration in respect of the 8.75% Senior Notes due 2008 and the 9.00% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2015 that have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Time and accepted for purchase by the Company on October 30, 2007 (the "Early Settlement Date").  The Company will pay (i) the total consideration for any 8.75% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2013 that were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Early Tender Time and accepted for purchase by AES and (ii) the Tender Offer Consideration for any Notes that were validly tendered and not withdrawn after the Early Tender Time and prior to the Expiration Time and accepted for purchase by the Company on November 14, 2007 (the "Final Settlement Date").  In addition, in all cases, holders will receive accrued interest from the last interest payment date for such series of Notes to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date, as applicable.
limit the Notes it accepts pursuant to the Tender Cap and in accordance with the acceptance priority levels as set forth in the Offer to Purchase.  Since the 8.75% Senior Notes due 2008 and the 9.00% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2015 have an acceptance priority level of 1 and 2, respectively, and the aggregate principal amount of the 8.75% Senior Notes due 2008 and the 9.00% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2015 combined is less than the Tender Cap, neither the 8.75% Senior Notes due 2008 nor the 9.00% Second Priority
AES may increase or modify the Tender Cap (in which case, the term "Tender Cap" will mean such amount as so increased) subject to applicable law, depending on the principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn without extending withdrawal rights to Holders.  If the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn at the Expiration Time exceeds the Tender Cap, the Company will (subject to the terms and conditions of the offer)
will be subject to proration; only the 8.75% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2013 will be subject to proration.  Except as set forth in AES's Offer to Purchase or as required by applicable law, Notes tendered prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 29, 2007, unless extended by AES in its sole discretion (the "Withdrawal Deadline") may only be withdrawn in writing before the Withdrawal Deadline, and Notes tendered after the Withdrawal Deadline but prior to the Expiration Time may not be withdrawn.
Senior Secured Notes due 2015
The tender offer is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain conditions.  If any of the conditions are not satisfied, AES is not obligated to accept for payment, purchase or pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of, any tendered Notes, in each event, subject to applicable laws, and may even terminate the tender offer.
