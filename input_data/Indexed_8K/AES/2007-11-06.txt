AES Reports Third Quarter Results
 
Quarterly Revenues Up 18% to $3.5 Billion; Gross Margin Up 2% to $840 Million
 
Arlington, VA, November 6, 2007The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) today reported results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2007. During the quarter, revenues increased by $524 million or 18% to $3.5 billion.  The increase in revenues reflects higher rates and volumes of approximately $284 million in Latin America, North America and Europe & Africa, favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $174 million and contributions from TEG and TEP, two plants in Mexico the Company acquired in first quarter 2007, of approximately $57 million.  Gross margin increased by $14 million or 2% to $840 million, primarily due higher prices in North America and contributions from TEG and TEP as well as the impacts of favorable foreign currency translation, a combined impact of approximately $106 million. These gains were partially offset by the impacts of gas curtailments and lower hydrology at our businesses in Argentina and Chile of approximately $112 million.
 
Third quarter income from continuing operations was $91 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, versus ($368) million, or ($0.56) per diluted share in third quarter 2006. Third quarter net income was $103 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, versus net loss of $327 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in third quarter 2006. Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.18 in third quarter 2007 versus $0.30 in third quarter 2006. The main driver of the quarter-over-quarter differences in both GAAP and adjusted earnings was the restructuring of certain of the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries in third quarter 2006. This restructuring resulted in a non-cash, after-tax charge to income from continuing operations of $500 million, or $0.76 per diluted share in third quarter 2006. It also resulted in a benefit of $0.07 to adjusted earnings per share in third quarter 2006. Excluding these one-time impacts, the decrease in third quarter 2007 earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per share was primarily driven by the Company's operations in Chile and Argentina, which negatively impacted income from continuing operations by approximately $45 million, or $0.07 impact on both diluted and adjusted earnings per share. Additionally, impairments in North American subsidiaries impacted income from continuing operations by approximately $20 million, or $0.03 impact on diluted earnings
per share. The impairments did not impact adjusted earnings per share. Higher energy prices in North America and contributions from new businesses partially offset these negative impacts.
 
from operating activities decreased by $187 million to $741 million. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of a Venezuelan subsidiary, C.A. La Electricidad de Caracas (EDC), in May 2007.  Excluding any contribution from EDC, net cash from operating activities would have decreased by approximately $19 million.
During the quarter, net cash
 
During the quarter, the Company was the winning bidder on two projects totaling 1,762 MW in the Philippines and the Republic of South Africa. Additionally, the Company's Alternative Energy group announced plans to begin construction of a 170 MW expansion of its Buffalo Gap wind farm in Texas. Once completed, the project will increase capacity at Buffalo Gap to 524 MW, making it one of the largest operating wind farms in the United States.
 
"We are pleased with our continued progress toward achieving our growth goals, such as winning two strategically important projects in the Philippines and South Africa. These investments will be platforms for further expansion in these two high growth markets," said Paul Hanrahan, AES President and CEO. "In October, the market gave us a vote of confidence when our $500 million offering of unsecured notes generated significant demand and was successfully upsized to $2 billion. This transaction will help us to achieve more flexibility in our existing capital structure, as we were able to refinance existing debt, and will support our growth program."
 
Income from continuing operations was $482 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2007 versus $149 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the prior year. Net loss, primarily due to the sale of EDC, was $112 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2007 versus net income of $190 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006. Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the first nine months was $0.82 versus $0.96 last year. Net cash from operating activities was $1.8 billion for the first nine months of 2007 versus $1.9 billion last year. Excluding the contributions from EDC, net cash from operating activities would have been $1.8 billion for the first nine months of 2007 and $1.6 billion for the first nine months of 2006.
 
 
Third Quarter 2007 Segment Highlights

 - 
                 
 
Asia Generation revenue increased by $44 million to $235 million, primarily due to higher dispatch in Pakistan and higher volume in Sri Lanka.

Safe Harbor Disclosure
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those related to future earnings, growth and financial and operating performance. Forward-looking statements are not intended to be a guarantee of future results, but instead constitute AES's current expectations based on reasonable assumptions. Forecasted financial information is based on certain material assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, continued normal levels of operating performance and electricity volume at our distribution companies and operational performance at our generation businesses consistent with historical levels, as well as achievements of planned productivity improvements and incremental growth investments at normalized investment levels and rates of return consistent with prior experience.
 
Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Important factors that could affect
actual results are discussed in AES's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, the risks discussed under Item 1A "Risk Factors" in AES's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. Readers are encouraged to read AES's filings to learn more about the risk factors associated with AES's business. AES undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
 
 
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses associated with (a) mark-to-market amounts related to FAS 133 derivative transactions, (b) foreign currency transaction impacts on the net monetary position related to Braziland Argentina, (c) significant asset gains or losses due to disposition transactions and impairments, and (d) costs related to the early retirement of recourse debt. AES believes that adjusted earnings per share better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability associated with mark-to-market gains or losses related to certain derivative transactions, currency transaction gains or losses, periodic strategic decisions to dispose of certain assets which may influence results in a given period, and the early retirement of corporate debt.

Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as net cash from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures (including environmental capital expenditures). AES believes that free cash flow is a useful measure for evaluating our financial condition because it represents the amount of cash provided by operations less maintenance capital expenditures as defined by our businesses, that may be available for investing or for repaying debt.
(2)
         
 
 
 
Subsidiary Distributions (a non-GAAP financial measure) is defined as cash distributions (primarily dividends and interest income) from subsidiary companies to the parent company and qualified holding companies. These cash flows are the source of cash flow to the parent.

The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) (a non-GAAP financial measure) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US. Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company (Parent). Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US. These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US. Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.

AES believes that unconsolidated parent company liquidity (a non-GAAP financial measure) is important to the liquidity position of AES as a parent company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
