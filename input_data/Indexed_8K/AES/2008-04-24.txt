any Option then held by such Employee, to the extent exercisable, shall automatically expire on the earlier of (1) the date the Option would have expired had the Employee continued in such employment and (2) one hundred and eighty days after the date the such Employee's service ceases, except that any Incentive Stock Option shall automatically expire on the earlier of clause (i) above and three months after the date that such Employee's service ceases, and
(ii)
         
 
(iii)  any Performance Award then held by such Employee which is not then payable will be paid in accordance with its terms at the time the Performance Award would have been payable if the termination of employment had not occurred, and the payment shall be prorated based on the number of days in the performance period that occurred prior to the termination of employment.
 
DURATION. The Plan shall be effective as of February 1, 2003, subject to its approval by the stockholders of the Company. No Award shall be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the effective date. However, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, and the authority of the Committee to administer the Plan and to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue, or terminate any such Award, or to waive any conditions or rights under any such Award, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall extend beyond such date.

AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION.
12.
        
 
Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly provided in an Agreement or in the Plan, the Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time; , that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made without (i) shareholder approval if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement for which or with which the Board deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply or (ii) the consent of the affected Participant, if such action would adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any outstanding Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as may be necessary to enable the Plan to achieve its stated purposes in any jurisdiction outside the United States in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with local rules and regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, (i) the Committee may at any time (without the consent of any Participant) modify or amend any or all of the provisions of the Plan or an Award to the extent necessary to conform the provisions of the of the Plan or an Award with Section 409A, the regulations issued thereunder or an exception thereto, regardless of whether such modification or amendment of the Award shall adversely affect the rights of a Participant, and (ii) the Committee may not, without stockholder approval, reduce the exercise price of any Option or stock appreciation right or take any other action with respect to outstanding Options or stock appreciation rights that is treated as a repricing of such Options or stock appreciation rights under generally accepted accounting principles (unless otherwise permitted by applicable listing standards).
(a)
         
provided, however
 
The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate, any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the consent of any Participant or holder or beneficiary of an Award, , that no such action shall impair the rights of a Participant or holder or beneficiary under any Award theretofore granted under the Plan.
(b)
        
provided, however
 
With respect to Participants who reside or work outside the United States of America, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend, or otherwise modify, without Board or shareholder approval, the terms of the Plan or Awards with respect to such Participant in order to conform such terms with the provisions of local law; provided that such amendment or other modification shall not increase the total number of Shares reserved for purposes of the Plan without the approval of the Stockholders of the Company.
(c)
         
 
The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, an event affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles), whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan.
(d)
        
 
To the extent not inconsistent with Section 14(k) hereof, in connection with a Change in Control or an event described in Section 4(e), the Committee may, in its discretion (i) cancel any or all outstanding Awards under the Plan in consideration for payment to the holder of each such cancelled Award of an amount equal to the portion of the consideration that would have been payable to such holder pursuant to such transaction if such Award had been fully vested and exercisable, and had been fully exercised, immediately prior to such transaction, less the exercise price if any that would have been payable therefore, or (ii) if the net amount referred to in clause (i) would be negative, cancel such Award for no consideration or payment of any kind. Payment of any amount payable pursuant to the preceding sentence may be made in cash and/or securities or other property in the Committee's discretion.
(e)
         
 
CHANGE IN CONTROL. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Agreement and to the extent not inconsistent with Section 14(k) hereof, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, all outstanding Options under this Plan shall become fully exercisable and all outstanding Awards (other than Options) under this Plan shall become fully vested and payable.
13.
        
 
MISCELLANEOUS.
14.
        
 
Nothing in the Plan or in any Agreement shall confer upon any Participant who is an Employee the right to continue in the service or employment of the Company or any Affiliate or affect any right which the Company or any Affiliate may have to terminate or modify the employment or provision of service of the Participant with or without cause.
(a)
         
 
The Company shall have a right to withhold from any payment of cash or Stock to a Participant or other person under the Plan an amount sufficient to cover any required withholding taxes, including the Participant's social security and Medicare taxes (FICA) and federal, state, local income tax or such other applicable taxes ("Taxes") with respect to income arising from payment of the Award. The Company shall have the right to require the payment of any Taxes before issuing any Stock pursuant to the Award. The Committee may, if it deems appropriate in the case of a Participant, withhold such Taxes through a reduction of the number of Shares delivered to such individual, or allow the Participant to elect to cover all or any part of the required withholdings, and to cover any additional withholdings up to the amount needed to cover the Taxes with respect to income arising from payment of the Award, through a reduction of the number of Shares delivered to such individual or a subsequent return to the Company of Shares held by the Participant or other person, in each case valued in the same manner as used in computing the withholding taxes under the applicable laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, any broker-assisted cashless exercise shall comply with the requirements for equity classification of Paragraph 35 of FASB Statement No. 123(R) and any withholding satisfied through a net-settlement shall be limited to the minimum statutory withholding requirements.
(b)
        
 
Awards received by a Participant under this Plan shall not be deemed a part of a Participant's regular, recurring compensation for purposes of any termination, indemnity or severance pay laws and shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of benefits under any other employee benefit plan, contract or similar arrangement provided by the Company or an Affiliate, unless expressly so provided by such other plan, contract or arrangement, or unless the Committee so determines. No provision of the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, including incentive arrangements
(c)
         
 
providing for the issuance of options and stock, and awards that do not qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, and such arrangements may be generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, (i) no Award and no right under any Award shall be assignable, alienable, saleable or transferable by a Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; , , that, if so determined by the Committee, a Participant may, in the manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise the rights of the Participant, and to receive any property distributable, with respect to any Award upon the death of the Participant; (ii) each Award, and each right under any Award, shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's guardian or legal representative; and (iii) no Award and no right under any such Award, may be pledged, alienated, attached, or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any Award which has been fully exercised, earned or paid, as the case may be, and shall not preclude forfeiture of an Award in accordance with the terms thereof.
(d)
        
provided
however
 
This Plan shall be unfunded and the Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards under this Plan. Neither the Company, its Affiliates, the Committee, nor the Board shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under this Plan nor shall anything contained in this Plan or any action taken pursuant to its provisions create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company and/or its Affiliates, and a Participant or Successor. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive an Award under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
(e)
         
 
 Any liability of the Company to any Participant with respect to an Award shall be based solely upon contractual obligations created by this Plan and the applicable Agreement. Except as may be required by law, neither the Company nor any member or former member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating (including participation pursuant to a delegation of authority under Sections 3(c) and 3(i) hereof) in any determination of any question under this Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application of this Plan, shall have any liability to any party for any action taken, or not taken, under this Plan.
(f)
           
 
No certificate for Shares distributable pursuant to this Plan shall be issued and delivered unless the issuance of such certificate complies with all applicable legal requirements including, without limitation, compliance with the provisions of applicable state securities laws, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and in effect from time to time or any successor statute, the Exchange Act and the requirements of the exchanges on which the Company's Shares may, at such time be listed.
(g)
        
 
To the extent that federal laws do not otherwise control, this Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant to this Plan shall be governed by the laws of Delaware and construed accordingly.
(h)
        
 
 In the event that any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Plan, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
(i)
            
 
 No fractional shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan or any Agreement, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities, or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated, or otherwise eliminated.
(j)
            
 
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Agreement to the contrary, if any Award or benefit provided under this Plan is subject to the provisions of Section 409A, the provisions of the Plan and any applicable Agreement shall be administered, interpreted and construed in a manner necessary to comply with Section 409A or an exception thereto (or disregarded to the extent such provision cannot be so administered, interpreted or construed). The following provisions shall apply, as applicable:
(k)
         
 
 If a Participant is a Specified Employee and a payment subject to Section 409A (and not excepted therefrom) to the Participant is due upon Separation from Service, such payment shall be delayed for a period of six (6) months after the date the Participant Separates from Service (or, if earlier, the death of the Participant). Any
(i)
            
 
payment that would otherwise have been due or owing during such six-month period will be paid immediately following the end of the six-month period in the month following the month containing the 6-month anniversary of the date of termination unless another compliant date is specified in the applicable Agreement.
 
For purposes of Section 409A, and to the extent applicable to any Award or benefit under the Plan, it is intended that distribution events qualify as permissible distribution events for purposes of Section 409A and shall be interpreted and construed accordingly. WWhether a Participant has Separated from Service or employment will be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances and, to the extent applicable to any Award or benefit, in accordance with the guidance issued under Section 409A. For this purpose, a Participant will be presumed to have experienced a Separation from Service when the level of  services performed permanently decreases to a level less than twenty percent (20%) of the average level of  services performed during the immediately preceding thirty-six (36) month period or such other applicable period as provided by Section 409A.
(ii)
         
ith respect to payments subject to Section 409A, the Company reserves the right to accelerate and/or defer any payment to the extent permitted and consistent with Section 409A.

The Committee, in its discretion, may specify the conditions under which the payment of all or any portion of any Award may be deferred until a later date. Deferrals shall be for such periods or until the occurrence of such events, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Board shall determine in its discretion, in accordance with the provisions of Section 409A, the regulations and other binding guidance promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that no deferral shall be permitted with respect to Options and other stock rights subject to Section 409A. An election shall be made by filing an election with the Company (on a form provided by the Company) on or prior to December 31st of the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the calendar year (or other applicable service period) to which such election relates (or at such other date as may be specified by the Board to the extent consistent with Section 409A) and shall be irrevocable for such applicable calendar year (or other applicable service period).
(iii)
      
 
The grant of Non-Qualified Stock Options and other stock rights subject to Section 409A shall be granted under terms and conditions consistent with Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(5) such that any such Award does not constitute a deferral of compensation under Section 409A. Accordingly, any such Award may be granted to Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling interest. In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest, the rules of Treas. Reg.  1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i) shall apply; provided that the language "at least 50 percent" shall be used instead of "at least 80 percent" in each place it appears; provided, further, where legitimate business reasons exist (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)(E)(i)), the language "at least 20 percent" shall be used instead of "at least 80 percent" in each place it appears. The rules of Treas. Reg.  1.414(c)-3 and 1.414(c)-4 shall apply for purposes of determining ownership interests.
(iv)
     
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and with respect to Options that were earned and vested under the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 (as determined under Section 409A, "Grandfather Options"), such Grandfathered Options are intended to be exempt from Section 409A and shall be administered and interpreted in a manner intended to ensure that any such Grandfathered Option remains exempt from Section 409A. No amendments or other modifications shall be made to such Grandfathered Options except as specifically set forth in a separate writing thereto, and no amendment or modification to the Plan shall be interpreted or construed in a manner that would cause a material modification (within the meaning of Section 409A, including Treas. Reg.  1.409A-6(a)(4)) to any such Grandfathered Options.
(v)
        
 
In no event shall any member of the Board, the Committee or the Company (or its employees, Officers or Directors) have any liability to any Participant (or any other Person) due to the failure of an Award to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A.
(vi)
     
 
This amendment and restatement of The AES Corporation 2003 Long Term Compensation Plan has been duly executed by the undersigned and is effective this 24th day of April 2008.
