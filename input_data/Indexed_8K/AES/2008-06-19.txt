On June 19, 2008, The AES Corporation (the "Company") announced the results of its previously announced tender offer for its senior notes, accepting for purchase an aggregate of $762.6 million principal amount of senior notes.  The press release for this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 8.01 of this report on Form 8-K.
 
The Company expects settlement of the tender offer and the consent solicitation by paying the applicable total consideration, tender offer consideration and/or consent fee, as the case may be, for each series of notes to occur on June 19, 2008.  Once the Company pays the applicable consideration with respect to the Second Priority Senior Secured Notes (the "Secured Notes") that have been validly tendered and accepted for payment in accordance with the tender offer and has paid the consent fee with respect to all consents that have been validly delivered in the consent solicitation prior to the early/tender consent time, the proposed amendments to the indenture governing the Secured Notes will become operative.  The proposed amendments eliminate many of the principal restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the Secured Notes.
 
A portion of the funds to pay the applicable consideration for the notes accepted for purchase in the tender offer and to pay the consent fee in the consent solicitation were derived from the Company's issuance and sale of $625 million aggregate principal amount of its 8.0% Senior Notes due 2020 in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which closed on May 19, 2008.
