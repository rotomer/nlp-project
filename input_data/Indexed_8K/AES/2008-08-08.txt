AES Reports Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2008 Results; Increases Full Year Adjusted EPS Guidance to $1.16
 
ARLINGTON, VA, August 8, 2008The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) today reported solid results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008.
 
 
"Our year-to-date results are ahead of expectations and we are increasing our full year earnings guidance accordingly.  Guidance for free cash flow will come in at the lower end of our range due to higher fuel and energy costs, which are mostly recoverable," said Paul Hanrahan, AES President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We continue to make good progress on the growth front.  This past quarter we achieved simple cycle operation on our 370 MW plant in Jordan and began construction on four power plants with a total capacity of 953 MW.  We also acquired a stake in a 49.5 MW wind project in China.  And our Climate Solutions group achieved a notable milestone by registering its first methane recovery project in Malaysia with the UN, a major step in creating Certified Emission Reductions (CERs)."
 
The Company also disclosed that the Board of Directors has authorized up to $400 million of share repurchases of its outstanding common stock.

Second Quarter 2008 in Review
 
During the second quarter 2008, the Company benefited from higher demand in Latin America, as well as higher pricing in Europe and Latin American generation businesses, offset in part by planned outages at North American generation businesses, the July 2007 tariff reset at Eletropaulo, one of our utilities in Brazil, and increased corporate overhead costs related primarily to SAP implementation worldwide.
 
Revenue
 
During the quarter, revenues increased period over period by $806 million, or 24%, to $4.1 billion.  The increase in revenues reflects higher prices across all regions and increased volume in Latin America of approximately $490 million, as well as favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $305 million.
 
Gross Margin
 
Gross margin increased period over period by $125 million, or 14%, to $1.0 billion.  Gross margin benefited $279 million from several factors including:  (i) a mark-to-market derivative gain on a coal supply agreement at the Company's subsidiary in Hawaii of approximately $110 million; (ii) a combination of higher volumes at the Latin American businesses and higher prices at the European businesses of approximately $94 million and (iii) favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $75 million.  These gains were offset in part by $147 million of reductions attributable to: (i) the July 2007 tariff reset at Eletropaulo, of approximately $74 million; (ii) planned outages at Eastern Energy in New York and Ironwood in Pennsylvania of approximately $25 million; (iii) higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo and Sonel, our integrated utility in Cameroon, of approximately $33 million; and (iv) higher fuel prices at our generation facilities in Pakistan and China of approximately $11 million.
 
Income from Continuing Operations & Net Income
 
Second quarter income from continuing operations was $903 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, versus $286 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in second quarter 2007.  The 2008 results include net adjustments of $1.14 including: (i) gain from sale of Northern Kazakhstan businesses of $908 million, or $1.31; (ii) additional tax expense of $131 million, or $0.19, related to the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds that were used to fund the early retirement of corporate debt; (iii) net mark-to-market derivative gains of $89 million or $0.08 at our North America subsidiaries, primarily related to a coal supply agreement at the Company's subsidiary in Hawaii; and
(iv) one-time losses related to debt restructuring charges of $69 million or $0.06.  The 2007 results include a gain of approximately $0.15 related to the acquisition of a leasehold interest in the Eastern Energy business in New York and the recovery of certain tax assets in Latin America.
 
Second quarter net income was $903 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, as compared to $254 million or $0.37 per diluted share reported for the second quarter 2007.  The 2007 result included a $0.05 charge associated with EDC, a Venezuelan subsidiary placed into discontinued operations in first quarter 2007 and later sold in May 2007.
 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.17 in second quarter 2008 versus $0.41 in second quarter 2007.  The second quarter 2008 result includes $0.08 of foreign currency transaction losses primarily in Chile and the Philippines.
 
Cash Flow
 
Second quarter 2008 net cash flow from operating activities was $320 million as compared to $514 million in second quarter 2007.  Excluding an $18 million contribution from EDC, a business sold in May 2007 but which is included in the consolidated statement of cash flows for second quarter 2007, net cash from operating activities would have decreased by approximately $176 million.
 
The period over period change in cash flow from operating activities in second quarter 2008 primarily reflects planned outages at its North America generation businesses,  previously announced tariff resets and an increase in regulatory assets primarily comprised of recoverable purchased energy costs at its Latin America utilities, higher fuel costs in Asia, and additional interest associated with higher average Parent  debt balances, offset in part by improved net working capital as a result of improved margin performance at its Latin America generation businesses.
 
Second quarter 2008 free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $135 million as compared to $207 million in second quarter 2007.  Excluding any contribution from EDC, free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) would have decreased by approximately $67 million.
 
Free cash flow in second quarter 2008 reflects the decrease in cash flow from operating activities offset in part by a decrease in maintenance capital expenditures.
Year-to-Date 2008 in Review
 
During the first six months of 2008, the Company benefited from improved operations at the Company's generation businesses in the Southern Cone region of Latin America and its generation businesses in Europe, offset in part by planned outages at North America businesses, previously announced tariff adjustments at its utility operations in Latin America and North America and increased corporate overhead costs related primarily to ERP implementation worldwide.
 
Revenue
 
During the first half of 2008, revenues increased period over period by $1.8 billion, or 28%, to $8.3 billion.  The increase in revenues reflects higher prices at our generation businesses across all regions and increased volume in Latin America of approximately $1.1 billion, as well as favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $620 million.
 
Gross Margin
 
Gross margin increased period over period by $322 million, or 18%, to $2.1 billion.  Gross margin benefited $668 million from several factors including:  (i) increased volume in Latin America and higher pricing at our European generation businesses of approximately $403 million; (ii) favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $155 million; and (iii) a $110 million mark-to-market derivative gain on a coal supply agreement at the Company's subsidiary in Hawaii.  These gains were offset in part by the July 2007 tariff reduction at Eletropaulo of approximately $165 million, higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo and Sonel of approximately $45 million, a charge of $32 million related to the establishment of a regulatory reserve for credits to customers at its Indianapolis Power and Light (IPL) subsidiary, and planned outages at Eastern Energy and Ironwood of approximately $29 million.
 
Income from Continuing Operations & Net Income
 
Year-to-date income from continuing operations was approximately $1.1 billion, or $1.65 per diluted share, versus $399 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, during the same period in 2007.  The 2008 results include net adjustments of $1.09 per diluted share including: (i) gain from sale of Northern Kazakhstan businesses of $908 million or $1.31 per diluted share; (ii) tax expense of $131 million or $0.19 per diluted share related to the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds that were used to fund the early retirement of corporate debt; (iii) net mark-to-market derivative gains of $82 million or $0.08 per diluted share at our North America subsidiaries, primarily related to a coal supply agreement at the Company's subsidiary in Hawaii; (iv) a one-time loss related to debt restructuring charges of $69 million or $0.06 per diluted share; and (v) impairment charges of $54 million or $0.05 per diluted share.  The 2007 result includes a gain of
approximately $0.15 per diluted share related to the acquisition of a leasehold interest in the Eastern Energy business in New York and the recovery of certain tax assets in Latin America, as well as impairment charges of $40 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
 
Year-to-date net income was approximately $1.1 billion, or $1.65 per diluted share, as compared to a loss of $207 million or ($0.31) per diluted share reported for the same period in 2007.  The 2007 loss was primarily driven by the sale of EDC, which resulted in a non-cash, after-tax charge of $676 million or $1.00 per diluted share.
 
Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.56 in the first six months of 2008 versus $0.66 in the same period of 2007.  First half 2008 adjusted earnings per diluted share includes $0.08 of foreign currency transaction losses primarily in the Philippines and Chile.
 
Cash Flow
 
Net cash flow from operating activities during the first six months of 2008 was $791 million as compared to $1.1 billion for the same period in 2007.  Excluding $151 million contribution from EDC, net cash from operating activities would have decreased by approximately $172 million.
 
The period over period change in cash flow from operating activities in the first six months of 2008 primarily reflects the sale of EDC in May 2007 combined with the impact of previously announced tariff resets and an increase in regulatory assets primarily comprised of recoverable purchased energy costs at its Latin America utilities, net working capital increases at its Asia generation businesses due to an increase in first quarter receivables at its Pakistan facilities, and additional interest associated with higher average corporate debt balances, offset in part by improved margin performance at its Latin America generation businesses.
 
Free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) during the first six months of 2008 was $427 million as compared to $603 million for the same period in 2007.  Excluding any contribution from EDC, free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) would have decreased by approximately $69 million.
 
Free cash flow in the first six months of 2008 reflects lower cash flow from operating activities offset in part by a decrease in maintenance capital expenditures.
2008 Outlook
 
On the basis of strong performance in the first half of the year, combined with a positive outlook regarding the next two quarters, the Company increased guidance for full-year 2008 adjusted earnings per diluted share (EPS) by $0.02 to $1.16.
 
The Company also updated its full-year 2008 cash flow guidance, reflecting its year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.  The revised 2008 estimates for cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) are $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.  This compares to the previous guidance issued in March 2008 of $2.3 to 2.4 billion for cash flow from operating activities and $1.4 to 1.6 billion for free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure).
 
A summary of the revised 2008 guidance elements is provided in the Appendix.

APPENDIX
 
Second Quarter 2008 Segment Highlights
 
Latin America Generation revenue increased by $358 million to $1.2 billion, primarily due to higher contract and spot prices at Gener in Chile of approximately $151 million, higher volumes, contract and spot prices at our businesses in Argentina of approximately $94 million, favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $52 million in Brazil, higher spot prices and volume at our businesses in the Dominican Republic of approximately $38 million and higher spot prices at our Panama businesses of approximately $20 million. Gross margin increased by $121 million to $319 million, primarily due to higher volume and spot prices at our businesses in Argentina of approximately $47 million and lower fixed costs of approximately $36 million at Tiete in Brazil due to a regulatory change in 2007 requiring pass-through to transmission companies in the second quarter of 2007 of cumulative charges associated with the use of their equipment in prior periods.  In addition, gross margin increased due to foreign currency translation of approximately $29 million, higher spot prices at our businesses in the Dominican Republic of approximately $19 million and higher volume of approximately $17 million at Tiete,
                 
offset in part by lower volumes and increased purchased electricity costs at Gener of approximately $32 million.
 
Latin America Utilities revenue increased by $257 million to $1.6 billion, primarily due to approximately $231 million in favorable foreign currency translation and increased volume of approximately $29 million at Eletropaulo and Sul in Brazil.  Gross margin decreased by $36 million to $268 million, primarily due to decreased rates at Eletropaulo of $74 million as a result of the July 2007 tariff reset combined with an increase in fixed costs at Eletropaulo arising from higher labor contingencies and provision for bad debts of approximately $20 million and a sales tax refund received by Eletropaulo in the second quarter of 2007 of approximately $17 million, offset in part by favorable foreign currency translation in Brazil of $41 million and higher volume at Eletropaulo of approximately $33 million.
                 
 
North America Generation revenue decreased by $12 million to $539 million, primarily due to a $30 million variance in the mark-to-market derivative adjustment at Deepwater in Texas and lower volume in New York due to outages and lower market capacity factors of approximately $11 million, partially offset by higher revenue at Merida in Mexico due to the pass-through of higher fuel costs of $17 million and higher volume at TEG TEP in Mexico of approximately $11 million.  Gross margin increased by $55 million to $242 million, primarily due to a $110 million mark-to-market derivative gain on a coal supply agreement at Hawaii, offset in part by a $30 million variance in the mark-to-market derivative adjustment at Deepwater and lower volumes primarily due to scheduled outages at Eastern Energy in New York and Ironwood in Pennsylvania of $25 million.
                 
 
North America Utilities revenue increased by $9 million to $267 million, due primarily to an increase in rate adjustments at Indianapolis Power & Light (IPL) in Indiana related to recoverable environmental investments of $13 million and the pass-through of higher fuel and purchased power expenses of $10 million, offset in part by $11 million of lower retail volumes due to unfavorable weather and $2 million of lower wholesale revenue primarily due to higher scheduled outage activity.  Gross margin decreased by $18 million to $60 million primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs of $4 million, higher maintenance expenses of $3 million primarily due to storms and outages, and lower retail margin of $6 million.
                 
 
Europe & Africa Generation revenue increased by $68 million to $283 million, primarily due to an increase in capacity income, higher fuel pass-through revenues and higher volume at Kilroot in Northern Ireland of approximately $30 million, favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $17 million and higher rates of approximately $11 million at our businesses in Hungary and an increase in volume and prices of approximately $5 million at our businesses in Kazakhstan. Gross margin increased by $26 million to $69 million, primarily due to higher rates in Kazakhstan of approximately $13 million, higher rates and volume in Hungary of approximately $11 million and an increase in capacity income at Kilroot of
                 
approximately $9 million, offset in part by an increase in fixed costs across the region of approximately $9 million.
 
Europe & Africa Utilities revenue increased by $38 million to $195 million, primarily due to increased tariff rates of approximately $17 million at our businesses in Ukraine, favorable foreign currency translation of $14 million and higher volume of $8 million at Sonel in Cameroon.  Gross margin decreased by $1 million to $20 million, primarily due to increased fixed costs at Sonel of approximately $14 million offset in part by higher volume at Sonel of approximately $12 million and higher rates of approximately $7 million in the Ukraine.
                 
 
Asia Generation revenue increased by $70 million to $321 million, primarily due to higher rates at both Pak Gen and Lal Pir in Pakistan of approximately $35 million and $27 million respectively, combined with the addition of Masinloc in the Philippines of approximately $36 million, offset in part by lower volumes at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka of approximately $15 million due to a decrease in demand from the off-taker and lower volume at Lal Pir and Pak Gen of approximately $5 million each due to reduced dispatch compared to prior year.  Gross margin decreased by $21 million to $39 million, primarily due to higher fuel costs at Lal Pir, Pak Gen and Chigen in China of approximately $11 million, combined with impact associated with unplanned outages of $3 million at Ras Laffan in Qatar.
                 
 
Year-to-Date 2008 Segment Highlights
 
Latin America Generation revenue increased by $826 million to $2.4 billion, primarily due to higher volume, contract and spot prices at Gener in Chile and at our businesses in Argentina of approximately $576 million, favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $103 million, higher spot prices and volume at our businesses in the Dominican Republic of approximately $62 million, higher spot prices and volume at our businesses in Panama of approximately $34 million and higher volume at Tiete in Brazil of approximately $33 million.  Gross margin increased by $271 million to $718 million, primarily due to higher volume, contract and spot prices at Gener and at our businesses in Argentina of approximately $134 million, favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $62 million, higher volume of approximately $33 million at Tiete in Brazil, higher spot prices at our businesses in the Dominican Republic of approximately $31 million and higher spot prices and volume at our businesses in Panama of approximately $28 million, and lower fixed costs of $27 million at Tiete due to a cumulative regulatory charge in 2007, offset in part by higher purchased energy prices at Uruguaiana in Brazil of approximately $39 million.
                 
 
Latin America Utilities revenue increased by $549 million to $3.0 billion, primarily due to approximately $463 million in favorable foreign currency translation in Brazil, as well as increased volumes at Eletropaulo and Sul in Brazil of approximately $124 million and $21 million, respectively.  This increase was offset in part by an overall decrease in rates across the region of approximately $61 million primarily due to the
                 
impact of the July 2007 tariff reset at Eletropaulo of $39 million.  Gross margin decreased by $24 million to $493 million, primarily due to reduced tariff rates at Eletropaulo of $165 million, increased fixed costs at Eletropaulo due to higher labor contingencies and provision for bad debts of approximately $21 million, lower rates at our El Salvador businesses of approximately $17 million due to the January 2008 tariff reset and a sales tax refund received by Eletropaulo in the second quarter 2007 of approximately $17 million, offset in part by higher volumes at Eletropaulo in Brazil of approximately $134 million and favorable foreign currency translation in Brazil of approximately $78 million.
 
North America Generation revenue increased by $41 million to $1.1 billion, primarily due to higher volume of approximately $33 million at TEG TEP in Mexico combined with availability bonuses earned at Red Oak in New Jersey of $14 million, $14 million higher revenue at Thames in Connecticut due to lower forced outages and a revenue recognition adjustment, and net higher revenue at Merida in Mexico due primarily to the pass-through of higher fuel costs of $23 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $4 million, offset by a revenue adjustment.  These effects were partially offset by lower volume at Eastern Energy in New York primarily due to planned outages and lower market capacity factors of approximately $18 million and a change in the mark-to-market derivative adjustment at Deepwater in Texas of $18 million.  Gross margin increased by $74 million to $402 million, primarily due to a $110 million mark-to-market derivative gain on a coal supply agreement at Hawaii combined with  availability bonuses earned at Red Oak of $4 million, offset in part by lower volumes primarily due to a scheduled outage at Eastern Energy of approximately $23 million and a change in the mark-to-market derivative adjustment of $18 million and higher fuel costs of approximately $6 million at Deepwater.
                 
 
North America Utilities revenue decreased by $5 million to $516 million, primarily due to the establishment of a $32 million regulatory reserve in 2008 for credits to customers at IPL in Indiana and approximately $8 million of lower retail volumes due to unfavorable weather compared to prior year, offset in part by higher rate adjustments related to recoverable environmental investments of approximately $20 million and approximately $14 million of higher fuel and purchased expenses passed through to customers.  Gross margin decreased by $47 million to $112 million, primarily due to lower retail margin of $29 million mainly due to the customer credits, higher maintenance expense of $6 million mainly due to storms and outages, and higher labor and benefits costs of $5 million.
                 
 
Europe & Africa Generation revenue increased by $136 million to $603 million, primarily due to an increase in capacity income and energy payments at Kilroot in Northern Ireland of $51 million, favorable currency translation in Hungary and Kazakhstan of approximately $30 million, higher rates in Kazakhstan of approximately $24 million and a net increase in rate and volume of $18 million in Hungary.  Gross margin increased by $59 million to $191 million, primarily due to
                 
higher price and volume in Kazakhstan and Hungary of $53 million and an increase in capacity income at Kilroot of approximately $24 million, offset in part by increases in fixed costs across the region of approximately $19 million.
 
Europe & Africa Utilities revenue increased by $75 million to $398 million, primarily due to increased tariff rates of approximately $37 million at our businesses in the Ukraine combined with favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $27 million and increased volume of approximately $9 million at Sonel in Cameroon.  Gross margin increased by $2 million to $44 million, primarily due to higher volume at Sonel of approximately $24 million attributable to improved hydrology and higher thermal capacity and due to increased tariff rates at our businesses in the Ukraine of approximately $12 million, offset in part by increases in fixed costs at Sonel and the Ukraine of approximately $25 million and $5 million, respectively.
                 
 
Asia Generation revenue increased by $205 million to $656 million, primarily due to higher rates driven by an increase in fuel prices at Pak Gen and Lal Pir in Pakistan of approximately $69 million and $60 million respectively, an increase in rates at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka of approximately $27 million and contribution of approximately $36 million from Masinloc in the Philippines.  Gross margin decreased by $16 million to $91 million, primarily due to higher coal prices at Chigen in China of approximately $10 million and an increase in fuel prices at Lal Pir and Pak Gen of approximately $4 million and $2 million, respectively.

(1) Subsidiary distributions should not be construed as an alternative to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities which are determined in accordance with GAAP.  Subsidiary distributions are important to the Parent Company because the Parent Company is a holding company that does not derive any significant direct revenues from its own activities but instead relies on its subsidiaries' business activities and the resultant distributions to fund the debt service, investment and other cash needs of the holding company.  The reconciliation of difference between the subsidiary distributions and the Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities consists of cash generated from operating activities that is retained at the subsidiaries for a variety of reasons which are both discretionary and non-discretionary in nature.  These factors include, but are not limited to, retention of cash to fund capital expenditures at the subsidiary, cash retention associated with non-recourse debt covenant restrictions and related debt service requirements at the subsidiaries, retention of cash related to sufficiency of local GAAP statutory retained earnings at the subsidiaries, retention of cash for working capital needs at the subsidiaries, and other similar timing differences between when the cash is generated at the subsidiaries and when it reaches the Parent Company and related holding companies.
 
(2) Liquidity is defined as cash at the Parent Company plus availability under corporate revolver plus cash at qualifying holding companies (QHCs).  AES believes that unconsolidated Parent Company liquidity is important to the liquidity position of AES as a Parent Company because of the non-recourse nature of most of AES's indebtedness.
 
(3) The cash held at qualifying holding companies (QHCs) represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the US.  Such subsidiaries had no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to AES, the Parent Company (Parent).  Cash at those subsidiaries was used for investment and related activities outside of the US.  These investments included equity investments and loans to other foreign subsidiaries as well as development and general costs and expenses incurred outside the US.  Since the cash held by these QHCs is available to the Parent, AES uses the combined measure of subsidiary distributions to Parent and QHCs as a useful measure of cash available to the Parent to meet its international liquidity needs.
