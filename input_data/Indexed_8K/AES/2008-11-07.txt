AES Reports Strong Cash Flow Growth in Third Quarter
 
                 
Third Quarter Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations up 57% to $0.22 and Adjusted Earnings Per Share up 47% to $0.25
                 
Third Quarter Consolidated Free Cash Flow up 9% to $642 million
                 
2008 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Guidance Reaffirmed
 
ARLINGTON, VA, November 6, 2008The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported strong operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008, benefiting from higher pricing across all regions and increased demand in Latin America.
 
"In the third quarter, our earnings were in line with our expectations when adjusted for foreign currency transaction impacts.  Our cash flows were strong, with Consolidated Free Cash Flows increasing by nine percent," said Paul Hanrahan, President and Chief Executive Officer of The AES Corporation.  "We also recognize that we are operating in an environment with increased market volatility.  As a result, we are taking aggressive steps to preserve liquidity, prioritize investments and reduce costs."
 
 Hanrahan.
"For the full year, and taking into consideration the foreign exchange transaction impacts, we are modifying Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) guidance for 2008 from $1.16 to $1.07.  Looking to 2009, we are lowering our Adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a range of $1.15 to $1.20, reflecting changes in assumptions about foreign currency exchange rates.  However, we are reaffirming 2009 guidance for Subsidiary Distributions of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion," added Mr.
 
Results for the quarter and year-to-date ended September 30, 2008 include the following:
 
 
"We are well positioned to weather current market trends," said Victoria D. Harker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of AES.  "As part of our earlier efforts to improve financial flexibility, including refinancing $2 billion of parent debt, we have substantially reduced our near-term obligations and extended their maturities while improving pricing.  At the subsidiary level, 93 percent of our debt is now in the local functional currency, which minimizes risk.  As a result of these initiatives, we expect that the 2009 and 2010 debt maturities will be satisfied by our existing cash and operating cash flows.  We are also pleased that the credit market recently demonstrated confidence in AES by providing a $1 billion financing with favorable terms for the Angamos project in Chile."
 
Third Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights (comparisons of Q3 2008 vs Q3 2007)
:
 
Consolidated Revenues up 25% to $4.3 billion, primarily due to higher prices across all regions and increased volume in Latin America, as well as favorable foreign currency translation and recovery of pass-through expenses
                 
Consolidated Gross Margin up 13% to $1.0 billion, with improved Latin American performance and favorable foreign currency translation
                 
Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations up 57% to $0.22
                 
Adjusted EPS from Continuing Operations (a non-GAAP financial measure) up 47% to $0.25 (see Appendix for reconciliation to GAAP), including $0.09 of foreign currency transaction losses primarily in the Philippines and Chile
                 
Net Income up 39% to $145 million or $0.22 per diluted share
                 
Consolidated Operating Cash Flow up 3% to $784 million primarily due to improved performance at our Latin America businesses and decreased net working capital requirements at our Latin America utility businesses
                 
Consolidated Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) up 9% to $642 million due to improved consolidated operating cash flow and lower maintenance capital expenditures
                 
 
Other Highlights and Recent Developments
:
 
Closed a 17 year, non-recourse debt financing of approximately $1 billion, at the blended cost of LIBOR plus 200 basis points, for the construction of the Angamos project, a 518 MW coal-fired plant located in northern Chile in October 2008
                 
In July 2008 started commercial operations of Buffalo Gap III, a 170 MW wind farm in Abilene, Texas, and raised approximately $240 million of tax-equity financing to replace the construction loan in July 2008
                 
Repurchased 10.7 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $143 million in August and September 2008
                 
 
Year-to-Date 2008 Financial Highlights (comparison year to date of Q3 2008 vs Q3 2007)
:
 
Consolidated Revenues up 27% to $12.6 billion, primarily due to higher prices at our generation businesses across all regions and increased volume in Latin America, as well as favorable currency translation and recovery of pass-through expenses.
                 
Consolidated Gross Margin up 17% to $3.0 billion, primarily due to increased volume in Latin America and higher pricing and volume at our European generation businesses, as well as favorable foreign currency translation.
                 
Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations up 156% to $1.87, including $1.31 gain from sale of Northern Kazakhstan businesses in May 2008.
                 
Adjusted EPS from Continuing Operations (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $0.81 (see Appendix for reconciliation to GAAP), including $0.12 of foreign currency transaction losses primarily in the Philippines and Chile.
                 
Net Income increased to $1.3 billion, or $1.87 per diluted share from a loss of $103 million or ($0.15) per diluted share in 2007.  The 2007 result reflects loss on the sale of a Venezuelan subsidiary, CA La Electricidad de Caracas (EDC), which resulted in a non-cash, after-tax charge of $676 million or $1.00 per diluted share.
                 
Consolidated Operating Cash Flow of $1.6 billion, down from $1.9 billion for the same period in 2007 (which included a $151 million contribution from EDC, a business sold in May 2007). The remaining $146 million decrease is primarily due to higher commodity prices impacting net working capital needs in Asia.
                 
Consolidated Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $1.1 billion, down from $1.2 billion for the same period in 2007.  Excluding any contribution from EDC, Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) would have decreased by approximately $16 million due primarily to lower operating cash flow, offset by reduced maintenance capital expenditures.
                 
 
Updated Guidance
:
 
The Company updated its previously announced guidance as follows:
 
For 2008, based on strong operating performance, the Company reaffirmed its Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) guidance, at $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion respectively.  The Company lowered its Adjusted EPS guidance by $0.09 to $1.07 to reflect non-cash, unrealized mark-to-market foreign currency transaction losses primarily in the Philippines and Chile.  The Company also lowered its guidance for Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations by $0.15 to $2.07 reflecting the change in Adjusted EPS as well as net losses totaling $0.06 related to impairment charges and a loss on a portion of its interest in a Latin American subsidiary.
                 
For 2009, the Company lowered its Adjusted EPS (a non-GAAP financial measure) guidance of $1.15-$1.20 primarily reflecting changes in assumptions about foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also reaffirmed its Subsidiary Distribution guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.
                 
 
Additional details regarding these guidance revisions are set forth in the Appendix to this press release.
