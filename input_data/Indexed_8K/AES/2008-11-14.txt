Item 8.01. Other Events
 
The AES Corporation is submitting its financial statements and financial statement footnotes for the period ended September 30, 2008 as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") eXtensible Business Reporting Language ("XBRL") Voluntary Filing Program. XBRL is an emerging XML-based standard in which interactive data tags uniquely identify individual items in a company's financial statements so they can be accessed directly, without having to search the entire filing.
 
Attached as Exhibit 100 to this report are the following financial statements from The AES Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2008, filed with the SEC on November 6, 2008, formatted in XBRL:  (i) the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, (ii) the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, (iii) the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 and (iv) the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, tagged as blocks of text. Users of this data are advised pursuant to Rule 401 of Regulations S-T that the financial and other information contained in the XBRL document is unaudited and that these are not the official publicly filed financial statements of The AES Corporation. The purpose of submitting these XBRL formatted documents is to test the related format and technology and, as a result, investors should continue to rely on the official filed version of the furnished documents and not rely on the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 100, in making investment decisions.
 
In accordance with Rule 402 of Regulation S-T, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 100, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf of the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
