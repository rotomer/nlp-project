Other Events
 
On March 26, 2009, the Company announced that it had closed an amendment to extend the maturity of its $785 million senior secured credit facility, under which Citicorp USA acts as administrative agent (the "Citi Facility").  Subsequently, on April 2, 2009, the Company announced that it had consummated the sale of $535 million senior unsecured notes maturing April 15, 2016 (the "Notes"). The net proceeds of the Notes offering totaled approximately $492 million, which were to be used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing or replacement of the Company's other outstanding debt.
 
The Company has determined that it will allocate a substantial portion of the proceeds of the Notes to replace $425 million of its $600 million senior unsecured credit facility among the Company, Merrill Lynch Bank USA and the banks party thereto (the "Merrill Facility").  Accordingly, on April 21, 2009, the Company provided a notice advising the administrative agent of the Merrill Facility that it is voluntarily reducing its commitment by $425 million.
 
The $785 million Citi Facility is not impacted by the voluntary reduction to the Merrill Facility.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
