On March 15, 2010, The AES Corporation (the "Company") completed the sale of 125,468,788 shares of common stock to Terrific Investment Corporation ("Investor"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Investment Corporation. The shares were sold for $12.60 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.58 billion. Investor's ownership in the Company's common stock is now approximately 15% percent of the Company's total outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis.
On March 12, 2010, the Company and Investor entered into a stockholder agreement (the "Stockholder Agreement"). Under the Stockholder Agreement, as long as Investor holds more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Investor will have the right to designate one nominee, who must be reasonably acceptable to the Board, for election to the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, until such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock, Investor has agreed to vote its shares in accordance with the recommendation of the Company on any matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company relating to the election of directors and compensation matters. Otherwise, Investor may vote its shares in its discretion. Further, under the Stockholder Agreement, Investor will be subject to a standstill restriction which generally prohibits Investor from purchasing additional securities of the Company beyond the level acquired by it under the stock purchase agreement entered into between Investor and the Company on November 6, 2009. In addition, Investor has agreed to a lock-up restriction such that Investor would not sell its shares for a period of 12 months following the closing, subject to certain exceptions. The standstill and lock-up restrictions also terminate at such time as Investor holds 5% or less of the outstanding shares of common stock. Investor will have certain registration rights and preemptive rights under the Stockholder Agreement with respect to its shares of common stock of the Company.
A copy of the Stockholder Agreement is attached as to this Report, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Stockholder Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Stockholder Agreement.

Any such separate firm (x) for the Investor, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control Persons of the Investor shall be designated in writing by the Investor, and (y) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding, and (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.
Section 6.9 . If the indemnification provided for in this from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or Indemnified Parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party under this as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.
