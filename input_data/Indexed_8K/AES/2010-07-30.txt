If a Revolving Fronting Bank is required at any time (whether before or after the Revolving Credit Loan Termination Date) to return to the Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official any portion of the payments made by the Borrower to such Revolving Fronting Bank in payment of any Reimbursement Obligation or interest thereon upon the insolvency of the Borrower, or the commencement of any case or proceeding under any
 
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law with respect to the Borrower, each Revolving Credit Loan Bank shall, on demand of such Revolving Fronting Bank, forthwith return to such Revolving Fronting Bank any amounts transferred to such Revolving Credit Loan Bank by such Revolving Fronting Bank in respect thereof pursuant to this subsection  such Revolving Credit Loan Bank's pro rata share of any interest on such payments required to be paid to the Person recovering such payments interest on the amount so demanded from the day such demand is made, if such demand is made by 2:00 P.M.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained herein, in no event shall any Revolving Credit Loan Bank be obligated to make any payment to a Revolving Fronting Bank to the extent that such payment would cause such Bank's pro rata share of the Total Outstandings hereunder to exceed such Bank's Revolving Credit Loan Commitment; that the foregoing shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower (which is absolute, unconditional and irrevocable) to reimburse each Revolving Fronting Bank for the entire amount of each payment made by such Revolving Fronting Bank under a Revolving Letter of Credit, including any amount thereof that is not paid by any Revolving Credit Loan Bank to such Revolving Fronting Bank (pursuant to this sentence or otherwise).

This situation could occur if an Alternative Currency exchange rate between the currency of a Revolving Letter of Credit issuance and Dollars changes between the date of issuance of, and the date of funding a Revolving L/C Drawing on, an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (or funding a deposit to the Revolving L/C Cash Collateral Account to cover issuances in excess of the Revolving Credit Loan Commitments) so that more Dollars are needed to purchase the Alternative Currency on the date of funding of the Revolving L/C Drawing on an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (or funding a deposit to the Revolving L/C Cash Collateral Account) than would have been needed to fund a Revolving L/C Drawing made on the issuance date of such Revolving Letter of Credit (, the currency of issuance has appreciated against the Dollar between the date of issuance and

Section 10.13 .
Severability; Modification to Conform to Law
It is the intention of the parties that this Agreement be enforceable to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, but that the unenforceability (or modification to conform to such law) of any provision or provisions hereof shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the remainder hereof. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, this Agreement shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed amended to modify or delete, as necessary, the offending provision or provisions and to alter the bounds thereof in order to render it or them valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision or provisions in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.13, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Banks shall be limited by Bankruptcy Laws, as determined in good faith by the Agent or the Revolving Fronting Bank, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
Section 10.14 .
Judgment Currency
If for the purposes of enforcing the obligations of the Borrower hereunder it is necessary to convert a sum due from such Person in Dollars into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Bank Parties could purchase Dollars with such currency at or about 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Domestic Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligations in respect of any sum due to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Bank Parties hereunder shall, notwithstanding any adjudication expressed in a currency other than Dollars, be discharged only to the extent that on the Domestic Business Day following receipt by the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Bank Parties of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Bank Parties may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase Dollars with such other currency; if the amount of Dollars so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Bank Parties in Dollars, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such adjudication, to indemnify the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Bank Parties against such loss, and if the amount of Dollars so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Bank Parties, it shall remit such excess to the Borrower.
Section 10.15 .
Revolving Fronting Banks
(a) Each (i) Third Party Fronting Bank or (ii) Revolving Credit Loan Bank who after the Effective Date agrees to become a Revolving Fronting Bank hereunder, shall execute and deliver to the Agent a Revolving Fronting Bank Agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto prior to issuing any letters of credit at the request or for the benefit of the Borrower. Upon execution and delivery by a Third Party Fronting Bank or such Revolving Credit Loan Bank to the Agent of a Revolving Fronting Bank Agreement, such Third Party Fronting Bank or such Revolving Credit Loan Bank, as the case may be, shall become a party to
 
this Agreement and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Revolving Fronting Bank as set forth herein. If the Third Party Fronting Bank or such Revolving Credit Loan Bank is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent certification as to exemption from, or reduction in, deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes as required by Section 8.04.
(b) Any Revolving Fronting Bank (including any Third Party Fronting Bank) may be released from its obligations hereunder as a Revolving Fronting Bank upon (x) the mutual agreement of such Revolving Fronting Bank and the Borrower and (y) notice to the Agent. With respect to any Revolving Fronting Bank who is not a Third Party Fronting Bank, nothing in this Section 10.05(b) shall release such Revolving Fronting Bank from its obligations hereunder as a Revolving Credit Loan Bank.
Section 10.16 .
Replacement of Banks
If (i) any Bank or any participant of such Bank requests compensation under Section 8.03, or (ii) if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Bank or any participant of such Bank or any governmental authority for the account of any Bank or any participant of such Bank pursuant to Section 8.04, or (iii) if such Bank has failed to consent to any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder requiring the consent of all Banks or all Banks directly affected thereby as to which the Required Banks or the majority of Banks directly affected thereby have given their consent or (iv) a Bank is a Defaulting Bank (each, a ) or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Bank as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Bank and the Agent, require such Bank to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Financing Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Bank, if a Bank accepts such assignment), that:
"
Non-Consenting Bank
"
provided

(b) such Bank shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Financing Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.12) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 8.03 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 8.04, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
 
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws or guidelines, directed duties or requests of, or agreements with, any governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law).
A Bank shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Bank or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. If the Borrower elects to exercise its rights with respect to a Non-Consenting Bank pursuant to clause (iii) above, then it must exercise such rights with respect to all but not less than all such Non-Consenting Banks. Each Bank agrees that, if it becomes a Non-Consenting Bank, it shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment an Assumption to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the Agent any Note (if the assigning Bank's Loans are evidenced by Notes) subject to such Assignment and Assumption; , , that the failure of any Non-Consenting Bank to execute an Assignment and Assumption shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid and such assignment shall be recorded in the Register.

Such notice shall set forth (x) the terms and conditions of the requested Permitted Amendments and (y) the date on which responses from the applicable Banks in respect of such Permitted Amendment are required to be received (which shall not be less than three Business Days after the date of such notice). Only those Banks that consent to such Permitted Amendment (the "") will have the maturity of their applicable Loans and Commitments extended and be entitled to receive any increase in the Base-Rate Margin or Euro-Dollar Margin, as applicable, and any fees (including prepayment premiums or fees), in each case, as provided therein.
Accepting Banks

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Permitted Amendment shall become effective under this Section 10.17 unless the Agent, to the extent so reasonably requested by the Agent, shall have received legal opinions, board resolutions and officer's certificates consistent with those delivered pursuant to Section 3.01.
 
Section 10.18 . Each Bank that is subject to the Act (as hereinafter defined) and the Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Bank) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the ""), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Bank or the Agent, as applicable, to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the Act.
