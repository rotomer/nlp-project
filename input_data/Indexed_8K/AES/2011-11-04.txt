AES Reports 35% Increase in Adjusted Earnings Per Share for Third Quarter 2011; Announces Intent to Declare a Dividend in the Third Quarter of 2012; On Track for 2011 and 2012 Adjusted EPS and Cash Flow Guidance
Third Quarter Results
 
 
Other Significant Announcements
 
 
 
 
 
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported strong results for the third quarter of 2011, driven by solid operating performance and a lower effective tax rate. Contributions from new businesses in Bulgaria, Northern Ireland and Chile and volume growth in Latin America offset lower prices at one of the Company's utilities in Brazil and previously disclosed repairs at Est, one of its hydroelectric power generation facilities in Panama.
ARLINGTON, Va., November 4, 2011 
"We had a strong third quarter and remain on track to meet our 2011 and 2012 guidance for cash flow metrics and adjusted EPS. We are executing on our core and growth markets strategy, accelerating our cost savings programs and working to close the acquisition of DP&L," said Andrs Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. "With these steps and the completion of more than 1,500 MW of new construction in 2011, we are confident in our future performance, and we intend to declare a $120 million annual dividend in the third quarter of 2012."
"We now anticipate savings in 2012 of $40 to $50 million, an increase from the $10 to $20 million we announced earlier this year, coming from more focused business development efforts and achieving greater synergies and efficiency from our new organizational structure," said Victoria D. Harker, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President of Global Business Services.
