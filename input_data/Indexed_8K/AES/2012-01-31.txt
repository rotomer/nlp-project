We have substantially all of the total expected coal volume needed to meet our retail and firm wholesale sales requirements for 2011 under contract. The majority of the contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices. Some contracts provide for periodic adjustments and some are priced based on market indices. Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, the wholesale market price of power, certain provisions in coal contracts related to government imposed costs, counterparty performance and credit, scheduled outages and generation plant mix. Due to the installation of emission controls equipment at certain jointly owned units and barring any changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, we expect to have a balanced SO

On May 1, 2008, substitute SB 221, an Ohio electric energy bill, was signed by the Governor and went into effect July 31, 2008. This law required that all Ohio distribution utilities file either an ESP or MRO. Under the MRO, a periodic competitive bid process will set the retail generation price after the utility demonstrates that it can meet certain market criteria and bid requirements. Also, under this option, utilities that still own generation in the state are required to phase-in the MRO over a period of not less than five years. An ESP may allow for adjustments to the SSO for costs associated with environmental compliance; fuel and purchased power; construction of new or investment in specified generating facilities; and the provision of standby and default service, operating, maintenance, or other costs including taxes. As part of its ESP, a utility is permitted to file an infrastructure improvement plan that will specify the initiatives the utility will take to rebuild, upgrade, or replace its electric distribution system, including cost recovery mechanisms. Both the MRO and ESP option involve a "significantly excessive earnings test" based on the earnings of comparable companies with similar business and financial risks. The PUCO issued three sets of rules related to implementation of the law. These rules address topics such as the information that must be included in an ESP as well as a MRO, the significantly excessive earnings test requirements, corporate separation revisions, rules relating to the recovery of transmission related costs, electric service and safety standards dealing with the statewide line extension policy, and rules relating to advanced energy portfolio standards, renewable energy, demand reduction and energy efficiency standards.
In compliance with SB 221, filed its ESP at the PUCO on October 10, 2008. This plan contained three parts: 1) a standard offer plan; 2) a CCEM plan; and 3) an alternative energy plan. After discussions with Commission Staff, the Ohio Consumers' Counsel and other interested parties, an ESP Stipulation was agreed to and filed on February 24, 2009. The ESP Stipulation, among other things, extended the Company's rate plan through 2012, provided for recovery of the Ohio retail customers' portion of fuel and purchased power costs beginning January 2010, provided for recovery of certain SB 221 compliance costs, and required to re-file its Smart Grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) business cases, which were part of the CCEM plan, by September 1, 2009. On June 24, 2009, the PUCO issued an order granting approval of the ESP Stipulation as filed and authorized to implement rates associated with alternative energy and energy efficiency compliance costs, which implemented beginning on July 1, 2009.

Consistent with the ESP Stipulation, re-filed its Smart Grid and AMI business cases with the PUCO on August 4, 2009 seeking recovery of costs associated with a three-year plan to deploy AMI; and a ten-year plan for distribution and substation automation, core telecommunications, supporting software and in-home technologies. In August 2009, submitted an application for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding for the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program, seeking $145.1 million of matching funds but was notified in October 2009, that we would not receive funding under the ARRA. On October 19, 2010, elected to withdraw the re-filed case pertaining to the Smart Grid and AMI programs. The PUCO accepted the withdrawal in an order issued on January 5, 2011. The PUCO also indicated that it expects to continue to monitor other utilities' Smart Grid and AMI programs and to explore the potential benefits of investing in Smart Grid and AMI programs and that will, when appropriate, file new Smart Grid and/or AMI business cases in the future.

SB 221 and the implementation rules contain targets relating to advanced energy portfolio standards, renewable energy, demand reduction and energy efficiency standards. If any targets are not met, compliance penalties will apply unless the PUCO makes certain findings that would excuse performance. In December 2009, made several filings relating to its renewable energy and energy efficiency compliance plans.  was able to obtain Renewable Energy Credits sufficient to meet its non-solar renewable energy targets, but obtained only 36% of the 2009 Ohio-based solar resources.  requested a waiver of any unmet 2009 Ohio solar requirements on grounds of force majeure because there were insufficient solar renewable energy credits available from Ohio resources. In March 2010, the PUCO ruled that 2009 Ohio solar target would be reduced to the amount that it had procured, but that any unmet requirement must be added to the 2010 target. has been able to acquire sufficient renewable resources in 2010 to meet its 2010 requirements plus that portion of the 2009 Ohio solar requirement that was added by the PUCO order.

On April 15, 2010, made its first annual required filing related to compliance with renewable and advanced energy targets contained in SB 221. Pursuant to PUCO rules, each April 15, and DPLER who are electric services companies pursuant to Ohio Revised Code, are required to provide a status report on whether or not they met the renewable benchmarks of the previous year, as well as a ten-year plan outlining their plans to meet future annual renewable targets. In addition, on April 15 of each year, each utility that owns an electric generating facility in Ohio must report to the PUCO regarding its greenhouse gas emissions, and plans to reduce those emissions (environmental control plan) as well as a long-term forecast report which includes a plan to provide sufficient resources to meet customer load obligations (resource plan).  long-term forecast filing was set for hearing. A settlement was reached in early 2011 under which the need for solar facilities was established. This settlement was filed with the PUCO for their approval.

In two separate filings, requested the PUCO's consent that had met the 2009 requirements for energy efficiency and for demand reduction based on interpretation of how those requirements should be applied. These filings also requested that if the PUCO disagreed with interpretation, the PUCO grant alternative relief and find that was unable to meet the targets due to reasons beyond its reasonable control, i.e., uncertainty throughout 2009 caused by delays in finalizing the rules and the lack of timely PUCO action on several of special contracts relating to demand response efforts which remain pending before the PUCO. Since this is a new process, it is unclear if a final order will be issued in these proceedings.

In addition, the rules that became effective December 10, 2009 required that on January 1, 2010, file an extensive energy efficiency portfolio plan, outlining how plans to comply with the energy efficiency and demand reduction benchmarks.  filed a separate request for a finding that it had already complied with this requirement in the form of portfolio plan that had been filed in 2008 as part of its CCEM plan, which had been approved by the PUCO and is being implemented. On May 19, 2010 the Commission approved in part and denied in part request that the Commission find that it met the 2009 energy efficiency portfolio requirements and directed to file a measurement and verification plan as well as a market potential study within 60 days of the date of the order.

We are unable to predict how the PUCO will respond to many of the filings discussed above, but believe that the outcome will not be material to our financial condition. However, as the energy efficiency and alternative energy targets get increasingly larger over time, the costs of complying with SB 221 and the PUCO's implementing rules could have a material impact on our financial condition.
The ESP Stipulation also provided for the establishment of a fuel and purchased power recovery rider beginning January 1, 2010. The fuel rider fluctuates based on actual costs and recoveries and is modified at the start of each seasonal quarter: March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 each year. is currently undergoing an audit of its fuel rider which is conducted by an independent third party in accordance with the PUCO standards. As a result there is some uncertainty as to the costs that will be approved for recovery. anticipates that some of this uncertainty will be resolved during the summer of 2011 after completion of the fuel audit. Based on the results of the audit, may record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment to earnings. It is too early to determine if any such adjustment would be material to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As a member of PJM, receives revenues from the RTO related to its transmission and generation assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. SB 221 included a provision that would allow Ohio electric utilities to seek and obtain a reconcilable rider to recover RTO-related costs and credits.  TCRR and PJM RPM riders were initially approved in November 2009 to recover these costs. Both the TCRR and the RPM riders assign costs and revenues from PJM monthly bills to retail ratepayers based on the percentage of SSO retail customers' load and sales volumes to total retail load and total retail and wholesale volumes. Customer switching to CRES providers decreases SSO retail customers' load and sales volumes. Therefore, increases in customer switching cause more of the RPM capacity costs and revenues to be excluded from the RPM rider calculation. RPM capacity costs and revenues are discussed further under "Regional Transmission Organizational Risks" in Item 1A  Risk Factors. annual true-up of these two riders was approved by the PUCO by an order dated April 28, 2010. On October 15, 2010 made an interim adjustment to both the TCRR and the RPM riders that had no material change to the rate recovery amounts.

On September 9, 2009, the PUCO issued an order establishing a significantly excessive earnings test (SEET) proceeding pursuant to provisions contained in SB 221. A question and answer session was held before the Commission on April 1, 2010 to allow the Commission to gain a better understanding of the issues. The PUCO issued an order on June 30, 2010 to establish general rules for calculating the earnings and comparing them to a comparable group to determine whether there were significantly excessive earnings. The other three Ohio utilities were required to make their SEET determinations in 2010 based on 2009 results. Pursuant to the ESP Stipulation, becomes subject to the SEET in 2013 based on 2012 earnings results and the SEET may have a material impact on operations.

Overall power market prices, as well as government aggregation initiatives within service territory, have led or may lead to the entrance of additional competitors in our service territory. During the year ended December 31, 2010, there were four additional unaffiliated marketers that registered as CRES providers in service territory, bringing the total number of CRES providers in service territory to eleven. DPLER, an affiliated company and one of the eleven registered CRES providers, has been marketing transmission and generation services to customers. During 2010, DPLER accounted for approximately 4,417 million kWh of the total 4,562 million kWh supplied by CRES providers within service territory. Also during 2010, 847 customers with an annual energy usage of 145 million kWh were supplied by other CRES providers within service territory, compared to 44 customers that had an annual energy usage of 16 million kWh during 2009. The volume supplied by DPLER represents approximately 31% of total distribution sales volume during 2010. The reduction to gross margin in 2010 as a result of customers switching to DPLER and other CRES providers was approximately $17 million and $53 million, for and , respectively. We currently cannot determine the extent to which customer switching to CRES providers will occur in the future and the impact this will have on our operations, but any additional switching could have a significant adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As part of Ohio's electric deregulation law, all of the state's investor-owned utilities are required to join a RTO. In October 2004, successfully integrated its 1,000 miles of high-voltage transmission into the PJM RTO. The role of the RTO is to administer a competitive wholesale market for electricity and ensure reliability of the transmission grid. PJM ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving 51 million people in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. PJM coordinates and directs the operation of the region's transmission grid, administers the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and plans regional transmission expansion improvements to maintain grid reliability and relieve congestion.

The PJM RPM capacity base residual auction for the 2013/2014 period cleared at a per megawatt price of $28/day for our RTO area. The per megawatt prices for the periods 2012/2013, 2011/2012 and 2010/2011 were $16/day, $110/day and $174/day, respectively, based on previous auctions. Future RPM auction results will be dependent not only on the overall supply and demand of generation and load, but may also be impacted by congestion as well as PJM's business rules relating to bidding for demand response and energy efficiency resources in the RPM capacity auctions. Increases in customer switching causes more of the RPM capacity costs and revenues to be excluded from the RPM rider calculation. We cannot predict the outcome of future auctions or customer switching but if the current auction price is sustained, our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could have a material adverse impact.

that would, if finalized, have a significant industry-wide impact on the operation of coal-fired generation units. We also have several other pending environmental matters associated with our coal-fired generation units and these pending matters, along with the new rules proposed by the USEPA, could result in significant capital and operations and maintenance expenditures for our coal-fired generation plants, and could result in the early retirement of our generation units that do not have SCR and FGD equipment installed. Currently, our coal-fired generation units at Hutchings and Beckjord do not have this emission-control equipment installed and their early retirement could occur as early as 2015. owns 100% of the Hutchings plant and has a 50% interest in Beckjord Unit 6.

Regulation Matters Related to Air Quality
Clean Air Act Compliance
In 1990, the federal government amended the CAA to further regulate air pollution. Under the law, the USEPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States. The CAA allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. The CAA has a material effect on our operations and such effects are detailed below with respect to certain programs under the CAA.
On October 27, 2003, the USEPA published final rules regarding the equipment replacement provision (ERP) of the routine maintenance, repair and replacement (RMRR) exclusion of the CAA. Activities at power plants that fall within the scope of the RMRR exclusion do not trigger new source review (NSR) requirements, including the imposition of stricter emission limits. On December 24, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stayed the effective date of the rule pending its decision on the merits of the lawsuits filed by numerous states and environmental organizations challenging the final rules. On June 6, 2005, the USEPA issued its final response on the reconsideration of the ERP exclusion. The USEPA clarified its position, but did not change any aspect of the 2003 final rules. This decision was appealed and the D.C. Circuit vacated the final rules on March 17, 2006. The scope of the RMRR exclusion remains uncertain due to this action by the D.C. Circuit, as well as multiple litigations not directly involving us where courts are defining the scope of the exception with respect to the specific facts and circumstances of the particular power plants and activities before the courts. While we believe that we have not engaged in any activities with respect to our existing power plants that would trigger the NSR requirements, if NSR requirements were imposed on any of existing power plants, the results could have a material adverse impact to us.
DP&L's
The USEPA issued a proposed rule on October 20, 2005 concerning the test for measuring whether modifications to electric generating units should trigger application of NSR standards under the CAA. A supplemental rule was also proposed on May 8, 2007 to include additional options for determining if there is an emissions increase when an existing electric generating unit makes a physical or operational change. The rule was challenged by environmental organizations and has not been finalized. While we cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking, any finalized rules could materially affect our operations.
Interstate Air Quality Rule
On December 17, 2003, the USEPA proposed the Interstate Air Quality Rule (IAQR) designed to reduce and permanently cap SO
2
and NOx emissions from electric utilities. The proposed IAQR focused on states, including Ohio, whose power plant emissions are believed to be significantly contributing to fine particle and ozone pollution in other downwind states in the eastern United States. On June 10, 2004, the USEPA issued a supplemental proposal to the IAQR, now renamed the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The final rules were signed on March 10, 2005 and were published on May 12, 2005. CAIR created an interstate trading program for annual NOx emission allowances and made modifications to an existing trading program for SO
2
. On August 24, 2005, the USEPA proposed additional revisions to the CAIR. On July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision to vacate the USEPA's CAIR and its associated Federal Implementation Plan and remanded to the USEPA with instructions to issue new regulations that conformed with the procedural and substantive requirements of the CAA. The Court's decision, in part, invalidated the new NOx annual emission allowance trading program and the modifications to the SO
2
emission trading program established by the March 10, 2005 rules, and created uncertainty regarding future NOx and SO
2
emission reduction requirements and their timing. The USEPA and a group representing utilities filed a request on September 24, 2008 for a rehearing before the entire Court. On December 23, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an order on reconsideration that permits CAIR to remain in effect until the USEPA issues new regulations that would conform to the CAA requirements and the Court's July 11, 2008 decision.
On July 6, 2010, the USEPA proposed the Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) which may replace CAIR in 2012. We have reviewed this proposal and submitted comments to the USEPA on September 30, 2010. We are unable to determine the overall financial impact that these rules could have on our operations in the future.
In 2007, the Ohio EPA revised their State Implementation Plan (SIP) to incorporate a CAIR program consistent with the IAQR. The Ohio EPA had received partial approval from the USEPA and had been awaiting full program approval from the USEPA when the U.S. Court of Appeals issued its July 11, 2008 decision. As a result of the December 23, 2008 order, the Ohio EPA proposed revised rules on May 11, 2009, which were finalized on July 15, 2009. On September 25, 2009, the USEPA issued a full SIP approval for the Ohio CAIR program. We do not expect that full SIP approval of the Ohio CAIR program will have a significant impact on operations.
 
Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants
On January 30, 2004, the USEPA published its proposal to restrict mercury and other air toxins from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants. The USEPA "de-listed" mercury as a hazardous air pollutant from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants and, instead, proposed a cap-and-trade approach to regulate the total amount of mercury emissions allowed from such sources. The final Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) was signed March 15, 2005 and was published on May 18, 2005. On March 29, 2005, nine states sued the USEPA, opposing the cap-and-trade regulatory approach taken by the USEPA. In 2007, the Ohio EPA adopted rules implementing the CAMR program. On February 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the USEPA regulations, finding that the USEPA had not complied with statutory requirements applicable to "de-listing" a hazardous air pollutant and that a cap-and-trade approach was not authorized by law for "listed" hazardous air pollutants. A request for rehearing before the entire Court of Appeals was denied and a petition for review before the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on October 17, 2008. On February 23, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition. The USEPA is expected to propose Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for coal- and oil-fired electric generating units during the quarter ending March 31, 2011 and finalize them during the quarter ending December 31, 2011. Upon publication in the federal register following finalization, affected electric generating units (EGUs) will have three years to come into compliance with the new requirements. is unable to determine the impact of the promulgation of new MACT standards on its financial condition or results of operations; however, a MACT standard could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot predict the final costs we may incur to comply with proposed new regulations to control mercury or other hazardous air pollutants.

On April 29, 2010, the USEPA issued a proposed rule that would reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from new and existing industrial, commercial and institutional boilers, and process heaters at major and area source facilities. This regulation may affect five auxiliary boilers used for start-up purposes at generation facilities. The proposed regulations contain emissions limitations, operating limitations and other requirements. The compliance schedule will be three years from the date when these rules, if finalized, become effective. We currently cannot determine whether or not these rules will be finalized nor can we predict the effect of compliance costs, if any, on operations. Such costs, however, are not expected to be material.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards
On January 5, 2005, the USEPA published its final non-attainment designations for the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for Fine Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5). These designations included counties and partial counties in which operates and/or owns generating facilities. On March 4, 2005, and other Ohio electric utilities and electric generators filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the final rule creating these designations. On November 30, 2005, the court ordered the USEPA to decide on all petitions for reconsideration by January 20, 2006. On January 20, 2006, the USEPA denied the petitions for reconsideration. On July 7, 2009, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the USEPA non-attainment designations for the areas impacting generation plants, however, on October 8, 2009 the USEPA issued new designations based on 2008 monitoring data that showed all areas in attainment to the standard with the exception of several counties in northeastern Ohio. The USEPA is expected to propose revisions to the PM 2.5 standard during the first quarter of 2011 as part of its routine five-year rule review cycle.

Final rules were published July 6, 2005, providing states with several options for determining whether sources in the state should be subject to BART. In the final rule, the USEPA made the determination that CAIR achieves greater progress than BART and may be used by states as a BART substitute. Numerous units owned and operated by us will be impacted by BART. We cannot determine the extent of the impact until Ohio determines how BART will be implemented.
On September 16, 2009, the USEPA announced that it would reconsider the 2008 national ground level ozone standard. A more stringent ambient ozone standard may lead to stricter NOx emission standards in the future. cannot determine the effect of this potential change, if any, on its operations.

Climate Change
In response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that the USEPA has the authority to regulate CO

emissions from motor vehicles, the USEPA made a finding that CO

2
and other GHGs from motor vehicles threaten the health and welfare of future generations by contributing to climate change. This finding became effective in January 2010. Numerous affected parties have petitioned the USEPA Administrator to reconsider this decision. On April 1, 2010, USEPA signed the "Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards" rule. Under USEPA's view, this is the final action that renders carbon dioxide and other GHGs "regulated air pollutants" under the CAA. As a result of this action, it is expected that in 2011 various permitting programs will apply to other combustion sources, such as coal-fired power plants.

Regulation Matters Related to Water Quality
Clean Water Act  Regulation of Water Intake
On July 9, 2004, the USEPA issued final rules pursuant to the Clean Water Act governing existing facilities that have cooling water intake structures. The rules require an assessment of impingement and/or entrainment of organisms as a result of cooling water withdrawal. A number of parties appealed the rules to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York and the Court issued an opinion on January 25, 2007 remanding several aspects of the rule to the USEPA for reconsideration. Several parties petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review of the lower court decision. On April 14, 2008, the Supreme Court elected to review the lower court decision on the issue of whether the USEPA can compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. Briefs were submitted to the Court in the summer of 2008 and oral arguments were held in December 2008. In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the USEPA did have the authority to compare costs with benefits in determining best technology available.

In July 2007, we received a draft permit proposing to continue our authority to discharge water from the station into the Ohio River. On February 5, 2008, we received a letter from the Ohio EPA indicating that they intended to impose a compliance schedule as part of the final Permit, that requires us to implement one of two diffuser options for the discharge of water from the station into the Ohio River as identified in the thermal discharge study. Subsequently, representatives from and the Ohio EPA agreed to allow to restrict public access to the water discharge area as an alternative to installing one of the diffuser options. Ohio EPA issued a revised draft permit that was received on November 12, 2008. In December 2008, the USEPA requested that the Ohio EPA provide additional information regarding the thermal discharge in the draft permit. In June 2009, provided information to the USEPA in response to their request to the Ohio EPA. In September 2010, the USEPA formally objected to a revised permit provided by Ohio EPA due to questions regarding the basis for the alternate thermal limitation. In December 2010, requested a public hearing on the objection, which USEPA has agreed to conduct. If a public hearing is held, it is anticipated that it would be scheduled in the first half of 2011. We are attempting to resolve this issue with both the USEPA and Ohio EPA. The timing for issuance of a final permit is uncertain. is unable to predict the impact this will have on its operations.

Regulation Matters Related to Land Use and Solid Waste Disposal
Regulation of Waste Disposal
In September 2002, and other parties received a special notice that the USEPA considers us to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at the South Dayton Dump landfill site. In August 2005, and other parties received a general notice regarding the performance of a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) under a Superfund Alternative Approach. In October 2005, received a special notice letter inviting it to enter into negotiations with the USEPA to conduct the RI/FS. No recent activity has occurred with respect to that notice or PRP status. However, on August 25, 2009, the USEPA issued an Administrative Order requiring that access to service center building site, which is across the street from the landfill site, be given to the USEPA and the existing PRP group to help determine the extent of the landfill site's contamination as well as to assess whether certain chemicals used at the service center building site might have migrated through groundwater to the landfill site. has granted such access and drilling of soil borings and installation of monitoring wells occurred in late 2009 and early 2010. believes the chemicals used at its service center building site were appropriately disposed of and have not contributed to the contamination at the South Dayton Dump landfill site. On May 24, 2010, three members of the existing PRP group, Hobart Corporation, Kelsey-Hayes Company and NCR Corporation, filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against and numerous other defendants alleging that and the other defendants contributed to the contamination at the South Dayton Dump landfill site and seeking reimbursement of the PRP group's costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the site. filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and intends to vigorously defend against any claim that it has any financial responsibility to remediate conditions at the landfill site. On February 10, 2011, the Court dismissed claims against that related to allegations that chemicals used by at its service center contributed to the landfill site's contamination. The Court, however, did not dismiss claims alleging financial responsibility for remediation costs based on hazardous substances from that were allegedly directly delivered by truck to the landfill.

Item 1A  Risk Factors
 
This annual report and other documents that we file with the SEC and other regulatory agencies, as well as other written or oral statements we may make from time to time, contain information based on management's beliefs and include forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and there are a number of factors including, but not limited to, those listed below, which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by terms and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "estimate," "expect," "continue," "should," "could," "may," "plan," "project," "predict," "will" and similar expressions.
Future operating results are subject to fluctuations based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: unusual weather conditions; catastrophic weather-related damage; unscheduled generation outages; changes in wholesale power sales prices; unusual maintenance or repairs; changes in fuel and purchased power costs, emissions allowance costs, or availability constraints; environmental compliance; and electric transmission system constraints.

Our customers have recently begun to select alternative electric generation service providers, as permitted by Ohio legislation.
Customers can elect to buy transmission and generation service from a PUCO-certified CRES provider offering services to customers in service territory. DPLER, a wholly-owned subsidiary of , is one of the PUCO-certified CRES providers and accounted for approximately 97% of the total retail energy supplied by CRES providers within service territory in 2010. Unaffiliated CRES providers also have been certified to provide energy in service territory and during 2010, approximately 800 customers switched their generation service to these providers. Customer switching from to DPLER reduces revenues since the generation rates charged by DPLER are less than the rates charged by . Increased competition by unaffiliated CRES providers in our service territory for retail generation service could result in the loss of existing customers and reduced revenues and increased costs to retain or attract customers. Decreased revenues and increased costs due to continued customer switching and customer loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The following are a few of the factors that could result in increased switching by customers to PUCO-certified CRES providers in the future:

We are subject to extensive laws and local, state and federal regulation, as well as related litigation, that could affect our operations and costs.
We are subject to extensive laws and regulation by federal, state and local authorities, such as the PUCO, the CFTC, the USEPA, the Ohio EPA, the FERC, the SEC, the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service, among others. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our business, including in the areas of the environment, health and safety, cost recovery and rate making, securities, corporate governance, public disclosure and reporting and taxation. New laws and regulations, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, are ongoing and we generally cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our business. Complying with this regulatory environment requires us to expend a significant amount of funds and resources. The failure to comply with this regulatory environment could subject us to substantial financial costs and penalties and changes, either forced or voluntary, in the way we operate our business. Additional detail about the effect of this regulatory environment on our operations is included in the risk factors set forth below. In the normal course of business, we are also subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under this regulatory environment or otherwise, which require us to expend significant funds to address, the outcomes of which are uncertain and the adverse resolutions of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The costs we can recover and the return on capital we are permitted to earn for certain aspects of our business are regulated and governed by the laws of Ohio and the rules, policies and procedure of the PUCO.
The costs we can recover and the return on capital we are permitted to earn for certain aspects of our business are regulated and governed by the laws of Ohio and the rules, policies and procedures of the PUCO. On May 1, 2008, SB 221, an Ohio electric energy bill, was signed by the Governor of Ohio and became effective July 31, 2008. This law, among other things, required all Ohio distribution utilities to file either an ESP or MRO, and established a significantly excessive earnings test for Ohio public utilities that compares the utility's earnings to the earnings of other companies with similar business and financial risks. The PUCO approved filed ESP on June 24, 2009. ESP provides, among other things, that existing rate plan structure will continue through 2012; that may seek recovery for adjustments to its existing rate plan structure for costs associated with storm damage, regulatory and tax changes, new climate change or carbon regulations, fuel and purchased power and certain other costs; and that SB 221's significantly excessive earnings test will apply in 2013 based upon 2012 earnings. ESP and certain filings made by us in connection with this plan are further discussed under "Ohio Retail Rates" in Item 1  COMPETITION AND REGULATION. In addition, as the local distribution utility, has an obligation to serve customers within its certified territory and under the terms of its ESP Stipulation, it is the provider of last resort (POLR) for standard offer service. current rate structure provides for a nonbypassable charge to compensate for this POLR obligation. The PUCO may decrease or discontinue this POLR rate charge at some time in the future.

While rate regulation is premised on full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the PUCO will agree that all of our costs have been prudently incurred or are recoverable or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce a full or timely recovery of our costs and permitted rates of return. Certain of our cost recovery riders are also by-passable by some of our customers who switched to a CRES provider. Accordingly, the revenue receives may or may not match its expenses at any given time. Therefore, could be subject to prevailing market prices for electricity and would not necessarily be able to charge rates that produce timely or full recovery of its expenses. Changes in, or reinterpretations of, the laws, rules, policies and procedures that set electric rates, permitted rates of return and POLR service; changes in rate structure and its ability to recover amounts for environmental compliance, POLR obligations, reliability initiatives, fuel and purchased power (which account for a substantial portion of our operating costs), customer switching, capital expenditures and investments and other costs on a full or timely basis through rates; and changes to the frequency and timing of rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our increased costs due to advanced energy and energy efficiency requirements may not be fully recoverable in the future.
SB 221 contains targets relating to advanced energy, renewable energy, peak demand reduction and energy efficiency standards. The standards require that, by the year 2025 and each year thereafter, 25% of the total number of kWh of electricity sold by the utility to retail electric consumers must come from alternative energy resources, which include "advanced energy resources" such as distributed generation, clean coal, advanced nuclear, energy efficiency and fuel cell technology; and "renewable energy resources" such as solar, hydro, wind, geothermal and biomass. At least half of the 25% must be generated from renewable energy resources, including solar energy. Annual renewable energy standards began in 2009 with increases in required percentages each year through 2024. The advanced energy standard must be met by 2025 and each year thereafter. Annual targets for energy efficiency began in 2009 and require increasing energy reductions each year compared to a baseline energy usage, up to 22.3% by 2025. Peak demand reduction targets began in 2009 with increases in required percentages each year, up to 7.75% by 2018. The advanced energy and renewable energy standards have increased our power supply costs and are expected to continue to increase (and could materially increase) these costs. Pursuant to approved ESP, is entitled to recover costs associated with its alternative energy plans, as well as its energy efficiency and demand response programs. began recovering these costs in 2009. If in the future we are unable to timely or fully recover these costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, if we were found not to be in compliance with these standards, monetary penalties could apply. These penalties are not permitted to be recovered from customers and significant penalties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The demand reduction and energy efficiency standards by design result in reduced energy and demand that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The availability and cost of fuel has experienced and could continue to experience significant volatility and we may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from fuel availability and price volatility.
We purchase coal, natural gas and other fuel from a number of suppliers. The coal market in particular has experienced significant price volatility in the last several years. We are now in a global market for coal in which our domestic price is increasingly affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance. Coal exports from the U.S. have increased significantly at times in recent years. In addition, domestic issues like government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues that affect mining costs and supply availability, the variable demand of retail customer load and the performance of our generation fleet have an impact on our fuel procurement operations. Our approach is to hedge the fuel costs for our anticipated electric sales. However, we may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from fuel price volatility. As of the date of this report, has substantially all of the total expected coal volume needed to meet its retail and firm wholesale sales requirements for 2011 under contract. Historically, some of our suppliers and buyers of fuel have not performed on their contracts and have failed to deliver or accept fuel as specified under their contracts. To the extent our suppliers and buyers do not meet their contractual commitments and, as a result of such failure or otherwise, we cannot secure adequate fuel or sell excess fuel in a timely or cost-effective manner or we are not hedged against price volatility, we could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, is a co-owner of certain generation facilities where it is a non-operating owner. does not procure or have control over the fuel for these facilities, but is responsible for its proportionate share of the cost of fuel procured at these facilities. Co-owner operated facilities do not always have realized fuel costs that are equal to our co-owners' projections, and we are responsible for our proportionate share of any increase in actual fuel costs. Pursuant to its ESP for SSO retail customers, implemented a fuel and purchased

power recovery mechanism beginning on January 1, 2010, which subjects our recovery of fuel and purchased power costs to tracking and adjustment on a seasonal quarterly basis. If in the future we are unable to timely or fully recover our fuel costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our use of derivative and nonderivative contracts may not fully hedge our generation assets, customer supply activities, or other market positions against changes in commodity prices, and our hedging procedures may not work as planned.
We transact coal, power and other commodities to hedge our positions in these commodities. These trades are impacted by a range of factors, including variations in power demand, fluctuations in market prices, market prices for alternative commodities and optimization opportunities. We have attempted to manage our commodities price risk exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management policies. Despite our efforts, however, these risk limits and management policies may not work as planned and fluctuating prices and other events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As part of our risk management, we use a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments, such as swaps, futures and forwards, to manage our market risks. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge against interest rate fluctuations related to our debt. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of some of these derivative instruments involves management's judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of some of these contracts. We could also recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant requirements related to derivatives that, among other things, could reduce the cost effectiveness of entering into derivative transactions.
In July 2010, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant requirements relating to derivatives, including, among others, a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges that would necessitate the posting of cash collateral for these transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act provides a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to establish rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's requirements and exceptions. Requirements to post collateral could reduce the cost effectiveness of entering into derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate volatility or could increase the demands on our liquidity or require us to increase our levels of debt to enter into such derivative transactions. Even if we were to qualify for an exception from these requirements, our counterparties that do not qualify for the exception may pass along any increased costs incurred by them through higher prices and reductions in unsecured credit limits. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations and may expose us to environmental liabilities.
Our operations and facilities (both wholly-owned and co-owned with others) are subject to numerous and extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality (such as reductions in NOx, SO
2
and particulate emissions), water quality, wastewater discharge, solid waste and hazardous waste. We could also become subject to additional environmental laws and regulations in the future (such as reductions in mercury and other hazardous air pollutants, SO
3
(sulfur trioxide), regulation of ash generated from coal-based generating stations and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor). With respect to our largest generation station, the J.M. Stuart Station, we are also subject to continuing compliance requirements related to NOx, SO
2
and particulate matter emissions under consent decree with the Sierra Club. Compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements requires us to expend significant funds and resources. These expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they could also be significant in the future. Complying with these numerous requirements could at some point become prohibitively expensive and result in our shutting down (temporarily or permanently) or altering the operation of our facilities. Environmental laws and regulations also generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. If we are not able to timely obtain, maintain or comply with all licenses, permits, inspections and approvals required to operate our business, then our operations could be prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Failure to comply with environmental laws, regulations and other requirements may result in the imposition of fines and penalties and the imposition of stricter environmental standards and controls and other injunctive measures affecting operating assets. In addition, any alleged violation of these laws, regulations and other requirements may require us to expend significant resources to defend against any such alleged violations. We own a non-controlling interest in several generating stations operated by our co-owners. As a non-controlling

In addition, ESP permits it to seek recovery for costs associated with new climate change or carbon regulations. While we expect to recover certain environmental costs and expenditures from customers, if in the future we are unable to fully recover our costs in a timely manner or the SSO retail riders are by-passable or additional customer switching occurs, we could have a material adverse impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, if we were found not to be in compliance with these environmental laws, regulations or requirements, any penalties that would apply would likely not be recoverable from customers and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

If legislation or regulations are passed at the federal or state levels imposing mandatory reductions of Greenhouse Gasses on generation facilities, we could be required to make large additional capital investments.
There is an on-going concern nationally and internationally among regulators, investors and others concerning global climate change and the contribution of emissions of GHGs, including most significantly CO
2
. This concern has led to increased interest in legislation and action at the federal and state levels and litigation, including a declaration by the USEPA that GHGs pose a danger to the public health that the USEPA believes allows it to directly regulate greenhouse emissions. There have been various GHG legislative proposals introduced in Congress and there is growing consensus that some form of legislation of GHG emissions will be approved at the federal level that could result in substantial additional costs in the form of taxes or emission allowances. Approximately 99% of the energy we produce is generated by coal. If legislation or regulations are passed at the federal or state levels imposing mandatory reductions of CO
2
and other GHGs on generation facilities, we could be required to make large additional capital investments. Legislation and regulations could also impair the value of our generation stations or make some of these stations uneconomical to maintain or operate and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, particularly coal, as an energy source for new and existing generation stations. Although is permitted under its current ESP to seek recovery of costs associated with new climate change or carbon regulations, our inability to fully or timely recover such costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Sales of any excess emission allowances are impacted by a range of factors, such as general economic conditions, fluctuations in market demand, availability of excess inventory available for sale and changes to the regulatory environment, including the status of the USEPA's CAIR. These factors could cause the amount and price of excess emission allowances we sell to fluctuate, which could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for any particular period. There has been overall reduced trading activity in the annual NOx and SO
2
emission allowance trading markets in recent years. This impact on the emission allowance trading market was due, in large part, to a court order calling into question the USEPA's CAIR annual NOx and SO
2
emission allowance trading programs and requiring the USEPA to issue new regulations to address the court order. The adoption of new regulations that could regulate emissions or establish or modify emission allowance trading programs, like the USEPA's proposed Clean Air Transport Rule to replace CAIR, could impact the emission allowance trading markets and have a material effect on emission allowance sales.

Diminished availability or performance of our transmission and distribution facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction and regulatory inquiries and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Operation of our owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and efficiency levels and likely result in lost revenues and increased expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In particular, since over 50% of our base-load generation is derived from co-owned generation stations operated by our co-owners, poor operational performance by our co-owners, misalignment of co-owners' interests or lack of control over costs (such as fuel costs) incurred at these stations could have an adverse effect on us. We have constructed and placed into service FGD facilities at most of our base-load generating stations. If there is significant operational failure of the FGD equipment at the generating stations, we may not be able to meet emission requirements at some of our generating stations or, at other stations, it may require us to burn more expensive cleaner coal or utilize emission allowances. These events could result in a substantial increase in our operating costs. Depending on the degree, nature, extent, or willfulness of any failure to comply with environmental requirements, including those imposed by the Consent Decree, such non-compliance could result in the imposition of penalties or the shutting down of the affected generating stations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Asbestos and other regulated substances are, and may continue to be, present at our facilities where suitable alternative materials are not available. Although we believe that any asbestos at our facilities is contained and suitable, we have been named as a defendant in asbestos litigation, which at this time is not material to us. The continued presence of asbestos and other regulated substances at these facilities could result in additional litigation being brought against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles. In addition, is subject to Ohio reliability standards and targets. Compliance with reliability standards subjects us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures. While we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the PUCO will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis or as a result of severe weather.
Weather conditions significantly affect the demand for electric power. In our Ohio service territory, demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year. Unusually mild summers and winters could therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, severe or unusual weather, such as hurricanes and ice or snow storms, may cause outages and property damage that may require us to incur additional costs that may not be insured or recoverable from customers. While is permitted to seek recovery of storm damage costs under its ESP, if is unable to fully recover such costs in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our membership in a regional transmission organization presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
On October 1, 2004, in compliance with Ohio law, turned over control of its transmission functions and fully integrated into PJM, a regional transmission organization. The price at which we can sell our generation capacity and energy is now dependent on a number of factors, which include the overall supply and demand of generation and load, other state legislation or regulation, transmission congestion, and PJM's business rules. While we can continue to make bilateral transactions to sell our generation through a willing-buyer and willing-seller relationship, any transactions that are not pre-arranged are subject to market conditions at PJM. To the extent we sell electricity into the power markets on a contractual basis, we are not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments through mandated rates. The PJM RPM base residual auction for the 2013/2014 and 2012/2013 periods cleared at a per megawatt price of $28/day and $16/day, respectively, for our RTO area. Prior to these auctions, the per megawatt prices for the 2011/2012 and 2010/2011 periods were $110/day and $174/day, respectively. The results of the PJM RPM base residual auction are impacted by the supply and demand of generation and load and also may be impacted by congestion and PJM rules relating to bidding for Demand Response and Energy Efficiency resources. Auction prices could fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We cannot predict the outcome of future auctions, but if the auction prices are sustained at low levels, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could have a material adverse impact.
DP&L
The rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may be required to expand our transmission system according to decisions made by PJM rather than our internal planning process. While PJM transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral, various proposals and proceedings currently taking place at FERC may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. In addition, PJM has been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on us. We also incur fees and costs to participate in PJM.
SB 221 includes a provision that allows electric utilities to seek and obtain deferral and recovery of RTO related charges. Therefore, most if not all of the above costs are currently being recovered through our SSO retail rates. If in the future, however, we are unable to defer or recover all of these cost in a timely manner, or the SSO retail riders are by-passable or additional customer switching occurs, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could have a material adverse impact.
As members of PJM, and DPLE are also subject to certain additional risks including those associated with the allocation among PJM members of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in PJM markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against PJM that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by PJM members including and DPLE. These amounts could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Costs associated with new transmission projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Annually, PJM performs a review of the capital additions required to provide reliable electric transmission services throughout its territory. PJM traditionally allocated the costs of constructing these facilities to those entities that benefited directly from the additions. FERC orders issued in 2007 and thereafter modified the traditional method of allocating costs associated with new high voltage planned transmission facilities. FERC ordered that the cost of new high-voltage facilities be socialized across the PJM region. Various parties, including , challenged this allocation method and in 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit ruled that the FERC had failed to provide a reasoned basis for the allocation method and remanded the case to the FERC for further proceedings. Until such time as FERC may act to approve a change in methodology, PJM will
DP&L
 
continue to apply the allocation methodology that had been approved by FERC in 2007. The overall impact of FERC's allocation methodology cannot be definitively assessed because not all new planned construction is likely to happen. The additional costs charged to for new large transmission approved projects were immaterial in 2010 and are not expected to be material in 2011. Over time, as more new transmission projects are constructed and if the allocation method is not changed, the annual costs could become material. Although we continue to maintain that the costs of these projects should be borne by the direct beneficiaries of the projects and that is not one of these beneficiaries, can, and currently is recovering these allocated costs from its SSO retail customers through the TCRR rider.

Our inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms, or at all, with creditworthy counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
From time to time we rely on access to the credit and capital markets to fund certain of our operational and capital costs. These capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption and the ability of corporations to obtain funds through the issuance of debt or equity has been negatively impacted. Disruptions in the credit and capital markets make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our business. Access to funds under our existing financing arrangements is also dependent on the ability of our counterparties to meet their financing commitments. Our inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms, or at all, with creditworthy counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability. has variable rate debt that bears interest based on a prevailing rate that is reset weekly based on a market index that can be affected by market demand, supply, market interest rates and other market conditions. We also currently maintain both cash on deposit and investments in cash equivalents that could be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations. In addition, select debt of and is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. If the rating agencies were to rate and below investment grade, we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate under certain existing and future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Our credit ratings also govern the collateral provisions of certain of our contracts, and a below investment grade credit rating by one of the rating agencies could require us to post cash collateral under these contracts. These events would likely reduce our liquidity and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Poor investment performance of our benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation. The Pension Protection Act, enacted in August 2006, requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans at times have increased and may increase in the future. In addition, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the discounted liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements for the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Declines in market values and increased funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our businesses depend on counterparties performing in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to perform, we could incur substantial expense, which could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.
We enter into transactions with and rely on many counterparties in connection with our business, including for the purchase and delivery of inventory, including fuel and equipment components (such as limestone for our FGD equipment), for our capital improvements and additions and to provide professional services, such as actuarial calculations, payroll processing and various consulting services. If any of these counterparties fails to perform its obligations to us or becomes unavailable, our business plans may be materially disrupted, we may be forced to discontinue certain operations if a cost-effective alternative is not readily available or we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and cause delays. These events could cause our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows to have a material adverse impact.
 
Our stock price may fluctuate on account of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.
The market price of common stock has fluctuated over a relatively wide range. Over the past three years, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated with a low of $19.16 and a high of $30.18. Our common stock in recent years has experienced significant price and volume variations that have often been unrelated to our operating performance. Over the previous year, the global markets have increasingly been characterized by substantially increased volatility in companies in a number of industries and in the broader markets. The market price of our common stock may continue to significantly fluctuate in the future and may be affected adversely by factors such as actual or anticipated change in our operating results, acquisition activity, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, general market conditions, rumors and other factors, which factors may increase price volatility and be exacerbated by continued disruption in the global markets at large.

Our consolidated results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond our control.
Economic pressures, as well as changing market conditions and other factors related to physical energy and financial trading activities, which include price, credit, liquidity, volatility, capacity, transmission and interest rates, can have a significant effect on our operations and the operations of our retail, industrial and commercial customers and our suppliers. The direction and relative strength of the economy has been increasingly uncertain due to softness in the real estate and mortgage markets, volatility in fuel and other energy costs, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, high unemployment and other factors. Many of these factors have disproportionately impacted our Ohio service territory.
Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively affected by sustained downturns or a sluggish economy. Sustained downturns, recessions or a sluggish economy generally affect the markets in which we operate and negatively influence our energy operations. A contracting, slow or sluggish economy could reduce the demand for energy in areas in which we are doing business. During economic downturns, our commercial and industrial customers may see a decrease in demand for their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of energy they require. In addition, our customers' ability to pay us could also be impaired, which could result in an increase in receivables and write-offs of uncollectible accounts. Our suppliers could also be affected by the economic downturn resulting in supply delays or unavailability. Reduced demand for our electric services, failure by our customers to timely remit full payment owed to us and supply delays or unavailability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The exercise of warrants would increase the number of common shares outstanding and increase our common share dividend costs, thus affecting any existing guidance on earnings per share and adversely affecting our financial condition and cash flows.
warrant holders can exercise their warrants to purchase shares of common stock at their discretion until March 12, 2012. As of the date of this report, the number of outstanding warrants is 1.7 million. As a result, could be required to issue up to 1.7 million common shares in exchange for the receipt of the exercise price of $21.00 per share or pursuant to a cashless exercise process. The exercise of warrants would increase the number of common shares outstanding and increase our common share dividend payments.

Accidental improprieties and undetected errors in our internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery, noncompliant disclosure and reporting or incorrect payment processing.
Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP in the United States of America, laws and regulations, taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations in order to, among other things, disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with our reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations and to properly process payments. We have implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act"). Our internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by management and our Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with Section 404 of the Act. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees, temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to improprieties and undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery, noncompliant disclosure and reporting or incorrect payment processing. The consequences of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 
New accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The SEC, FASB or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
The SEC has issued a roadmap for the transition by U.S. public companies to the use of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board that could result in significant changes to our accounting and reporting, such as in the treatment of regulatory assets and liabilities and property. Under the SEC's proposed roadmap, we could be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS in 2015. The SEC expects to make a determination in 2011 regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. We are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of IFRS.
If we are unable to maintain a qualified and properly motivated workforce, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could have a material adverse effect.
One of the challenges we face is to retain a skilled, efficient and cost-effective workforce while recruiting new talent to replace losses in knowledge and skills due to retirements. This undertaking could require us to make additional financial commitments and incur increased costs. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could have a material adverse impact. In addition, we have employee compensation plans that reward the performance of our employees. While we seek to ensure that our compensation plans encourage acceptable levels for risk and high performance through pay mix, performance metrics and timing, and although we have policies and procedures in place to mitigate excessive risk-taking by employees; excessive risk-taking by our employees to achieve performance targets could result in events that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We are subject to collective bargaining agreements and other employee workforce factors that could affect our businesses.
Over half of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that is in effect until October 31, 2011. While we believe that we maintain a satisfactory relationship with our employees, it is possible that labor disruptions affecting some or all of our operations could occur during the period of the bargaining agreement or at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement before a new agreement is negotiated. Work stoppages by, or poor relations or ineffective negotiations with, our employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Potential security breaches and terrorism could adversely affect our business.
Man-made problems, such as human error, computer viruses, terrorism, theft and sabotage, may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. We operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. In the course of our business, we also store and use certain of our customers', employees' and others' personal information and other confidential and sensitive information. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover them in a timely way, we could be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive and confidential information and other data could be compromised, which could result in negative publicity, remediation costs and potential litigation, damages, consent orders, injunctions, fines and other relief. These events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our third party service providers that provide critical business functions or have access to sensitive and confidential information and other data may also be vulnerable to security breaches and other man-made problems that could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, our generation plants, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our business. Any such disruption could result in a
 
material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We operate and manage generation assets and are exposed to a number of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, electricity wholesale price risk, PJM capacity price risk, regulatory risk, environmental risk, fuel supply and price risk, customer switching risk and the risk associated with power plant performance. We attempt to manage these risks through various means. For instance, we operate a portfolio of wholly-owned and jointly-owned generation assets that is diversified as to coal source, cost structure and operating characteristics. We are focused on the operating efficiency of these power plants and maintaining their availability.
We operate and manage transmission and distribution assets in a rate-regulated environment. Accordingly, this subjects us to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that we may recover and the investment returns that we may collect in customer rates. We are focused on delivering electricity and maintaining high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost-effective manner.
Additional information relating to our risks is contained in Item 1A  Risk Factors.
We have identified certain issues that we believe may have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the future. The following issues mentioned below are not meant to be exhaustive but to provide insight on matters that are likely to have an effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future:

Overall power market prices, as well as government aggregation initiatives within service territory, have led or may lead to the entrance of additional competitors in our service territory. During the year ended December 31, 2010, there were four additional unaffiliated marketers that registered as CRES providers in service territory, bringing the total number of CRES providers in service territory to eleven. DPLER, an affiliated company and one of the eleven registered CRES providers, has been marketing transmission and generation services to customers. During 2010, DPLER accounted for approximately 4,417 million kWh of the total 4,562 million kWh supplied by CRES providers within service territory. During 2010, 847 customers with an annual energy usage of 145 million kWh were supplied by other CRES providers within service territory, compared to 44 customers that had an annual energy usage of 16 million kWh during 2009. The volume supplied by DPLER represents approximately 31% of total distribution sales volume during 2010. The reduction to gross margin in 2010 as a result of customers switching to DPLER and other CRES providers was approximately $17 million and $53 million, for and , respectively. We currently cannot determine the extent to which customer switching to CRES providers will occur in the future and the impact this will have on our operations, but any additional switching could have a significant adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

FUEL AND RELATED COSTS
 
The coal market is a global market in which domestic prices are affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance. In addition, domestic issues like government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues are affecting mining costs and supply availability. Our approach is to hedge the fuel costs for our anticipated electric sales. For the year ending December 31, 2011, we have hedged substantially all our coal requirements to meet our committed sales. We may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. If our suppliers do not meet their contractual commitments or we are not hedged against price volatility and we are unable to recover costs through the fuel and purchased power recovery rider, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially affected.
Effective January 2010, the SSO retail customers' portion of fuel price changes, including coal requirements and purchased power costs, was reflected in the implementation of the fuel and purchased power recovery rider, subject to PUCO review. is currently undergoing an audit of its fuel and purchased power recovery rider and as a result there is some uncertainty as to the costs that will be approved for recovery. Independent third parties conduct the fuel audit in accordance with the PUCO standards. anticipates that some of this uncertainty will be resolved during the summer of 2011 after completion of the fuel audit. Based on the results of the audit, may record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment to earnings. It is too early to determine if any such adjustment would be material to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, sold coal and excess emission allowances to various counterparties realizing total net gains of $4.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, compared to total net gains of $56.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, realized over the same period in 2009. For 2010, these gains are recorded as a component of fuel costs and are reflected in operating income. Coal sales are impacted by a range of factors but can be largely attributed to the following: price volatility among the different coal basins or the quality of coal based on market conditions (coal optimization), variation in power demand, and the market price of power compared to the cost to produce power. Sales of excess emission allowances are impacted, among other factors, by: general economic conditions; fluctuations in market demand and pricing; availability of excess inventory available for sale; and changes to the regulatory

environment in which we operate. The combined impact of these factors on our ability to sell coal and emission allowances in 2011 and beyond is not fully known at this time and could materially impact the amount of gains that will be recognized in the future. Effective January 2010, as part of the operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery rider, the SSO retail customers' share of the emission gains and a portion of the SSO retail customers' share of the coal gains were used to reduce the overall rate charged to customers.

Revenues
Retail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, our retail sales volume is impacted by the number of heating and cooling degree days occurring during a year. Cooling degree days typically have a more significant impact than heating degree days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes.
 
 
Since we plan to utilize our internal generating capacity to supply our retail customers' needs first, increases in retail demand may decrease the volume of internal generation available to be sold in the wholesale market and vice versa. The wholesale market covers a multi-state area and settles on an hourly basis throughout the year. Factors impacting our wholesale sales volume each hour of the year include: wholesale market prices; our retail demand; retail demand elsewhere throughout the entire wholesale market area; our plants' and other utility plants' availability to sell into the wholesale market and weather conditions across the multi-state region. Our plan is to make wholesale sales when market prices allow for the economic operation of our generation facilities not being utilized to meet our retail demand or when margin opportunities exist between the wholesale sales and power purchase prices.
The following table provides a summary of changes in revenues from prior periods:
 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, Revenues increased $294.2 million, or 19%, to $1,883.1 million from $1,588.9 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of higher average retail and wholesale rates, higher retail sales volume, and increased RTO capacity and other revenues, partially offset by lower wholesale sales volume.

DPL  Depreciation and Amortization
During the year ended December 31, 2010, Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.1 million, or 4%, as compared to 2009. The decrease primarily reflects the impact of a depreciation study which resulted in lower depreciation rates on generation property which were implemented on July 1, 2010, reducing the expense by approximately $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, Depreciation and amortization expense increased $7.8 million, or 6%, as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of higher asset balances at the generating stations. These higher balances were due largely to the completion of the FGD projects during 2008.
DPL  General Taxes
During the year ended December 31, 2010, General taxes increased $9.3 million, or 8%, as compared to 2009. These increases were primarily the result of higher property tax accruals in 2010 compared to 2009, increased state excise taxes due to increased revenue and an adjustment to future credits against state gross receipt taxes.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, General taxes decreased $7.4 million, or 6%, as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower property tax accruals in 2009 compared to 2008 and lower kWh excise taxes resulting from lower retail sales volumes.
DPL  Investment Income (Loss)
During the year ended December 31, 2010, Investment income (loss) increased $2.4 million as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the $1.4 million expense incurred in 2009 related to the early redemption of debt (see subsequent paragraph below). In addition, had higher cash and short-term investment balances in 2010 compared to 2009 which resulted in higher investment income.
DPL
During the year ended December 31, 2009, Investment income (loss) decreased $4.2 million, or 117%, as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower cash and short-term investment balances combined with overall lower market yields on investments in 2009. In addition, we also recorded a $1.4 million expense during 2009 related to a loss incurred upon the early redemption of a debt obligation.
 
DPL  Interest Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2010, Interest expense decreased $12.4 million, or 15%, as compared to 2009 primarily due to the early redemption in December 2009 of $52.4 million of the $195 million 8.125% Note to DPL Capital Trust II and the redemption of $175 million 8.00% Senior Notes in March 2009.

Utility Segment
The Utility segment is comprised of electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses which generate and sell electricity to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Electricity for the segment's 24-county service area is primarily generated at eight coal-fired power plants and is distributed to more than 500,000 retail customers who are located in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio. also sells electricity to DPLER and any excess energy and capacity is sold into the wholesale market. transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators while rates for its generation business are deemed competitive under Ohio law.

Competitive Retail Segment
The Competitive Retail segment is comprised of DPLER's competitive retail electric service business which sells retail electric energy under contract primarily to commercial and industrial customers who have selected DPLER as their alternative electric supplier. The Competitive Retail segment sells electricity to approximately 9,000 customers currently located throughout Ohio. Due to increased competition in Ohio, during 2010 we increased the number of employees and resources assigned to manage DPLER and increased its marketing to customers. The Competitive Retail segment's electric energy used to meet its sales obligations was purchased from . During 2010, we implemented a new wholesale agreement between and DPLER. Under this agreement, intercompany sales from to DPLER were based on the market prices for wholesale power. In periods prior to 2010, DPLER's purchases from were transacted at prices that approximated DPLER's sales prices to its end-use retail customers. The Competitive Retail segment has no transmission or generation assets. The operations of DPLER are not subject to rate regulation by federal or state regulators.

Competitive Retail Segment  Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2010, the segment's retail revenues increased $210.7 million, or 325%, as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily driven by increased levels of competition in the competitive retail electric service business in the state of Ohio which in turn has resulted in a significant number of retail customers switching their retail electric service to DPLER. Primarily as a result of the customer switching discussed above, the Competitive Retail segment sold approximately 4,546 million kWh of power to 9,002 customers during 2010 compared to 1,464 million kWh to 390 customers during 2009.
DP&L's
For the year ended December 31, 2009, the segment's retail revenues decreased $85.9 million, or 57%, as compared to 2008. This decrease primarily reflected customers switching their retail electric service from DPLER back to due to the expiration of a significant number of customers' service contracts at the end of 2008. As a result, the Competitive Retail segment sold approximately 1,464 million kWh of power to 390 customers during 2009 compared to 3,212 million kWh to 742 customers during 2008.
DP&L
Competitive Retail Segment  Purchased Power
During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Competitive Retail segment purchased power increased $173.7 million, or 268%, as compared to 2009 primarily due to higher purchased power volumes required to satisfy an increase in customer base resulting from customer switching. The Competitive Retail segment's electric energy used to meet its sales obligations was purchased from . During 2010, we implemented a new wholesale agreement between and DPLER. Under this agreement, intercompany sales from to DPLER were based on the market prices for wholesale power. In periods prior to 2010, DPLER's purchases from were transacted at prices that approximated DPLER's sales prices to its end-use retail customers. This increase was partially offset by lower average prices paid for purchased power in 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, purchased power decreased $85.8 million, or 57%, as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily associated with lower 2009 retail volumes due to the expiration of some customers' service contracts in 2008 as discussed under Competitive Retail Segment  Revenue above.
 
Competitive Retail Segment  Operation and Maintenance
DPLER's operation and maintenance expenses include employee-related expenses, accounting, information technology, payroll, legal and other administration expenses. The higher operation and maintenance expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 and 2008 is reflective of increased marketing and customer maintenance costs associated with the increased sales volume and number of customers.

Liquidity
We expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, taxes, interest and dividend payments. For 2011 and subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations and funds from the capital markets as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under credit facilities will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods.
At the filing date of this annual report on Form 10-K, has access to $420 million of short-term financing under two revolving credit facilities. The first facility for $220 million expires in November 2011 and has three participating banks; the lead bank has a total commitment of 36% while the other two have commitments of 32% each. The second facility, established in April 2010, is for $200 million and expires in April 2013. A total of five banks participate in this facility, with no bank having more than 35% of the total commitment.

Capital Requirements
 
Planned construction additions for 2011 relate primarily to new investments in and upgrades to power plant equipment, and transmission and distribution system.

Approximately $20 million of this projected amount is to enable to meet the recently revised reliability standards of NERC. is subject to the mandatory reliability standards of NERC, and Reliability First Corporation (RFC), one of the eight NERC regions, of which is a member. NERC has recently changed the definition of the Bulk Electric System (BES) to include 100 kV and above facilities, thus expanding the facilities to which the reliability standards apply.  138 kV facilities were previously not subject to these reliability standards. Accordingly, anticipates spending approximately $100 million within the next 5 years to reinforce its 138 kV system to comply with these new NERC standards. Our ability to complete capital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by our financial condition, the availability of internal funds and the reasonable cost of external funds.

Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits of $19.4 million, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included such amounts in the contractual obligations table above.
We are subject to certain market risks including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices for electricity, coal, environmental emissions and gas, changes in capacity prices and fluctuations in interest rates. We use various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts, primarily to limit our exposure to fluctuations in commodity pricing. Our Commodity Risk Management Committee (CRMC), comprising of members of senior management, is responsible for establishing risk management policies and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures relating to our -operated generation units. The CRMC meets on a regular basis with the objective of identifying, assessing and quantifying material risk issues and developing strategies to manage these risks.
DP&L
Commodity Pricing Risk
Commodity pricing risk exposure includes the impacts of weather, market demand, increased competition and other economic conditions. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures at our -operated generation units, we use a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments including forward contracts and futures contracts. These instruments are used principally for economic hedging purposes and none are held for trading purposes. Derivatives that fall within the scope of derivative accounting under GAAP must be recorded at their fair value and marked to market unless they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. MTM gains and losses on derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are deferred in AOCI until the forecasted transactions occur. We adjust the derivative instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedging to fair value on a monthly basis and where applicable, we recognize a corresponding Regulatory asset for above-market costs or a Regulatory liability for below-market costs in accordance with regulatory accounting under GAAP.
DP&L
The coal market has increasingly been influenced by both international and domestic supply and consumption, making the price of coal more volatile than in the past, and while we have substantially all of the total expected coal volume needed to meet our retail and firm wholesale sales requirements for 2011 under contract, sales requirements may change, particularly for retail load. The majority of the contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices. Some contracts provide for periodic adjustments and some are priced based on market indices. Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, the wholesale market price of power, certain provisions in coal contracts related to government imposed costs, counterparty performance and credit, scheduled outages and generation plant mix. To the extent we are not able to hedge against price volatility or recover increases through our fuel and purchased power recovery rider that began in January 2010; our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially affected.
 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), signed into law in July 2010, contains significant requirements relating to derivatives, including, among others, a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges that would necessitate the posting of cash collateral for these transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act provides a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's requirements and exceptions. Requirements to post collateral could reduce the cost effectiveness of entering into derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate volatility or could increase the demands on our liquidity or require us to increase our levels of debt to enter into such derivative transactions. Even if we were to qualify for an exception from these requirements, our counterparties that do not qualify for the exception may pass along any increased costs incurred by them through higher prices and reductions in unsecured credit limits.
For purposes of potential risk analysis, we use a sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts of market rate changes on the statements of results of operations. The sensitivity analysis represents hypothetical changes in market values that may or may not occur in the future.
Commodity Derivatives
To minimize the risk of fluctuations in the market price of commodities, such as coal, power, and heating oil, we may enter into commodity-forward and futures contracts to effectively hedge the cost/revenues of the commodity. Maturity dates of the contracts are scheduled to coincide with market purchases/sales of the commodity. Cash proceeds or payments between us and the counter-party at maturity of the contracts are recognized as an adjustment to the cost of the commodity purchased or sold. We generally do not enter into forward contracts beyond thirty-six months.
A 10% increase or decrease in the market price of our wholesale power forward contracts and heating oil forwards at December 31, 2010 would not have a significant effect on Net income.
The following table provides information regarding the volume and average market price of our NYMEX coal forward derivative contracts at December 31, 2010 and the effect to Net income if the market price were to increase or decrease by 10%:

RPM Capacity Revenues and Costs
As a member of PJM, receives revenues from the RTO related to its transmission and generation assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. PJM, which has a delivery year which runs from June 1 to May 31, has conducted auctions for capacity through the 2013/14 delivery year. The clearing prices for capacity during the PJM delivery periods from 2008/9 through 2013/14 are as follows:
DP&L
 
Our computed average capacity prices by calendar year are reflected in the table below:
 
Future RPM auction results are dependent on a number of factors, which include the overall supply and demand of generation and load, other state legislation or regulation, transmission congestion, and PJM's RPM business rules. The volatility in the RPM capacity auction pricing has had and will continue to have a significant impact on capacity revenues and costs. Although currently has an approved RPM rider in place to recover or repay any excess capacity costs or revenues, the RPM rider only applies to customers supplied under our SSO. Customer switching reduces the number of customers supplied under our SSO, causing more of the RPM capacity costs and revenues to be excluded from the RPM rider calculation.
DPL's
DP&L
The table below provides estimates of the effect on annual net income as of December 31, 2010, of a hypothetical increase or decrease of $10 in the RPM auction price. The table shows the impact resulting from capacity revenue changes. We did not include the impact of a change in the RPM capacity costs since these costs will either be recovered through the RPM rider for SSO retail customers or recovered through the development of our overall energy pricing for customers who do not fall under the SSO. These estimates include the impact of the RPM rider and are based on the 2010 levels of customer switching. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 60% of RPM capacity revenues and costs were recoverable from SSO retail customers through the RPM rider.
DP&L's
 
Capacity revenues and costs are also impacted by, among other factors, the levels of customer switching, our generation capacity, the levels of wholesale revenues and our retail customer load. In determining the capacity price sensitivity above, we did not consider the impact that may arise from the variability of these other factors.
Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
and fuel (including coal, gas, oil and emission allowances) and purchased power costs as a percentage of total operating costs in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 34% and 33%, respectively.

allowances will depend on market prices for power, availability of our generation units and the actual sulfur content of the coal burned. We may purchase some NOx allowances for 2011 depending on NOx emissions. Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, reliability of coal deliveries, scheduled outages and generation plant mix.
Purchased power costs depend, in part, upon the timing and extent of planned and unplanned outages of our generating capacity. We will purchase power on a discretionary basis when wholesale market conditions provide opportunities to obtain power at a cost below our internal generation costs.
Effective January 1, 2010, was allowed to recover its SSO retail customers' share of fuel and purchased power costs, of approximately 60% of retail sales, as part of the fuel rider approved by the PUCO.

We maintain both cash on deposit and investments in cash equivalents that may be affected by adverse interest rate fluctuations. has fixed-rate long-term debt and has both fixed and variable-rate long-term debt. variable-rate debt is comprised of publicly held pollution control bonds.

We partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by entering into interest rate swap agreements to limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. As of December 31, 2010, we have entered into interest rate hedging relationships with an aggregate notional amount of $200 million and $160 million related to planned future borrowing activities in calendar year 2011 and calendar year 2013, respectively. The average interest rate associated with the $200 million and $160 million aggregate notional amount interest rate hedging relationships is 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. During the first quarter of 2011, we entered into additional interest rate hedging relationships with an aggregate notional amount of $75 million related to planned future borrowing activities in calendar year 2011. The average interest rate associated with the additional $75 million aggregate notional amount interest rate hedging relationships is 4.0%. We are limiting our exposure to changes in interest rates since we believe the market interest rates at which we will be able to borrow in the future may increase.

Long-term Debt Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis
Our estimate of market risk exposure is presented for our fixed-rate and variable-rate debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 for which an immediate adverse market movement causes a potential material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the fair value of the debt. We believe that the adverse market movement represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not hold any market risk sensitive instruments which were entered into for trading purposes.

On the variable-rate debt, the interest rate risk with respect to long-term debt represents the potential impact an increase of one percentage point in the interest rate has on results of operations related to $100 million variable-rate long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010.

Equity Price Risk
As of December 31, 2010, approximately 41% of the defined benefit pension plan assets were comprised of investments in equity securities and 59% related to investments in fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The equity securities are carried at their market value of approximately $119.9 million at December 31, 2010. A hypothetical 10% decrease in prices quoted by stock exchanges would result in an $12.0 million reduction in fair value as of December 31, 2010 and approximately a $1.0 million increase to the 2011 pension expense.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any investment contract, loan agreement or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk arises from all activities in which success depends on issuer, borrower or counterparty performance, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. We limit our credit risk by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continue to evaluate their creditworthiness after transactions have been originated. We use the three leading corporate credit rating agencies and other current market-based qualitative and quantitative data to assess the financial strength of counterparties on an ongoing basis. We may require various forms of credit assurance from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk.
and Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of these financial statements, our management is required to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain.
DPL's
DP&L's
Different estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances. Historically, however, recorded estimates have not differed materially from actual results. Significant items subject to such judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of derivative instruments; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for receivables and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; reserves recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits.
 
In accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for impairments, long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. We determine the fair value of these assets based upon estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available or independent appraisals, if required. In analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows, we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates, future economic conditions, assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. The measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset.
Impairments and Assets Held for Sale:
 
 We consider revenue realized, or realizable, and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the products or services have been provided to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. The determination of the energy sales to customers is based on the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. We recognize revenues using an accrual method for retail and other energy sales that have not yet been billed, but where electricity has been consumed. This is termed "unbilled revenues" and is a widely recognized and accepted practice for utilities. At the end of each month, unbilled revenues are determined by the estimation of unbilled energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading, projected line losses, the assignment of unbilled energy provided to customer classes and the average rate per customer class. Given our estimation method and the fact that customers are billed monthly, we believe it is unlikely that materially different results will occur in future periods when these amounts are subsequently billed.
Revenue Recognition (including Unbilled Revenue):
Judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty, since taxing authorities may interpret them differently. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to Net income and cash flows and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material. We have adopted the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Taking into consideration the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes, these GAAP provisions establish standards for recognition and measurement in financial statements of positions taken, or expected to be taken, by an entity on its income tax returns. Positions taken by an entity on its income tax returns that are recognized in the financial statements must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, assuming that the position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information.
Income Taxes:
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. We evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets.
Application of the provisions of GAAP relating to regulatory accounting requires us to reflect the effect of rate regulation in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For regulated businesses subject to federal or state cost-of-service rate regulation, regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated companies. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, we defer these costs as Regulatory assets that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies. Likewise, we recognize Regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates and when revenue is collected from customers for expenses that are not yet incurred. Regulatory assets are amortized into expense and Regulatory liabilities are amortized into income over the recovery period authorized by the regulator.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities:
We evaluate our Regulatory assets to determine whether or not they are probable of recovery through future rates and make various assumptions in our analyses. The expectations of future recovery are generally based on orders issued by regulatory commissions or historical experience, as well as discussions with applicable regulatory authorities. If recovery of a regulatory asset is determined to be less than probable, it will be written off in the period the assessment is made. We currently believe the recovery of our Regulatory assets is probable. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for AROs, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are required to be recognized at their fair value at the time those obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a legal liability, costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. These GAAP provisions also require that components of previously recorded depreciation related to the cost of removal of assets upon retirement, whether legal AROs or not, must be removed from a company's accumulated depreciation reserve. We make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses as they relate to AROs. These assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time.
AROs:
 
In addition to insurance obtained from third-party providers, MVIC, a wholly-owned captive subsidiary of provides insurance coverage solely to us, our subsidiaries and, in some cases, our partners in commonly-owned facilities we operate, for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, and directors' and officers' liability.

The MVIC reserves at and the workers' compensation, medical, life and disability reserves at are actuarially determined based on a reasonable estimation of insured events occurring. There is uncertainty associated with the loss estimates and actual results may differ from the estimates. Modification of these loss estimates based on experience and changed circumstances is reflected in the period in which the estimate is re-evaluated.

We account for and disclose pension and postretirement benefits in accordance with the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for pension and other postretirement plans. These GAAP provisions require the use of assumptions, such as the discount rate for liabilities and long-term rate of return on assets, in determining the obligations, annual cost, and funding requirements of the plans.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits:
For 2011, we have decreased our long-term rate of return assumption from 8.50% to 8.00% for pension plan assets. We are maintaining our long-term rate of return assumption of 6.00% for other postemployment benefit plan assets. These rates of return represent our long-term assumptions based on our current portfolio mixes. We have decreased our assumed discount rate to 5.31% from 5.75% for pension and to 4.96% from 5.35% for postretirement benefits expense to reflect current duration-based yield curve discount rates. A one percent change in the rate of return assumption for pension would result in an increase or decrease to the 2011 pension expense of approximately $2.9 million. A one percent change in the discount rate for pension would result in an increase or decrease to the 2011 pension expense of approximately $2.5 million. We do not anticipate any special adjustments to expense in 2011.
In future periods, differences in the actual return on pension and other post-employment benefit plan assets and assumed return, or changes in the discount rate, will affect the timing of contributions to the plans, if any. We provide postretirement health care benefits to employees who retired prior to 1987. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would affect postretirement benefit costs by less than $1.0 million.
During the conduct of our business, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that potentially subject us to environmental, litigation, insurance and other risks. We periodically evaluate our exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with GAAP. In recording such reserves, we may make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses as they relate to contingent and other obligations. These assumptions and estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions and may be subject to change. We, however, believe such estimates and assumptions are reasonable.

Certain immaterial amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current reporting presentation.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the revenues and expenses of the periods reported. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and judgments include: the carrying value of Property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of derivative instruments; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for receivables and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; reserves recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized from retail and wholesale electricity sales and electricity transmission and distribution delivery services. We consider revenue realized, or realizable, and earned when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the products or services have been provided to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Energy sales to customers are based on the reading of their meters that occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. We recognize the revenues on our statements of results of operations using an accrual method for retail and other energy sales that have not yet been billed, but where electricity has been consumed. This is termed "unbilled revenues" and is a widely recognized and accepted practice for utilities. At the end of each month, unbilled revenues are determined by the estimation of unbilled energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading, estimated line losses, the assignment of unbilled energy provided to customer classes and the average rate per customer class.
All of the power produced at the generation plants is sold to an RTO and we in turn purchase it back from the RTO to supply our customers. These power sales and purchases are reported on a net hourly basis as revenues or purchased power on our statements of results of operations. We record expenses when purchased electricity is received and when expenses are incurred, with the exception of the ineffective portion of certain power purchase contracts that are derivatives and qualify for hedge accounting. We also have certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, and their unrealized gains or losses are recorded prior to the receipt of electricity.
Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
We establish provisions for uncollectible accounts by using both historical average loss percentages to project future losses and by establishing specific provisions for known credit issues.
Property, Plant and Equipment
We record our ownership share of our undivided interest in jointly-held plants as an asset in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. For regulated transmission and distribution property, cost includes direct labor and material, allocable overhead expenses and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). AFUDC represents the cost of borrowed funds and equity used to finance regulated construction projects. Capitalization of AFUDC ceases at either project completion or at the date specified by regulators. AFUDC capitalized in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was not material.
For unregulated generation property, cost includes direct labor and material, allocable overhead expenses and interest capitalized during construction using the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for capitalized interest. Capitalized interest was $1.5 million, $2.4 million and $8.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
For substantially all depreciable property, when a unit of property is retired, the original cost of that property less any salvage value is charged to Accumulated depreciation and amortization consistent with the composite method of depreciation.
Property is evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
At December 31, 2010, neither nor had any material plant acquisition adjustments or other plant-related adjustments.
DPL
DP&L
Repairs and Maintenance
Costs associated with maintenance activities, primarily power plant outages, are recognized at the time the work is performed. These costs, which include labor, materials and supplies, and outside services required to maintain equipment and facilities, are capitalized or expensed based on defined units of property.
Depreciation Study  Change in Estimate
Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method, which allocates the cost of property over its estimated useful life. For generation, transmission and distribution assets, straight-line depreciation is applied monthly on an average composite basis using group rates. In July 2010, completed a depreciation rate study for non-regulated generation property based on its property, plant and equipment balances at December 31, 2009, with certain adjustments for subsequent property additions. The results of the depreciation study concluded that many of composite depreciation rates should be reduced due to projected useful asset lives which are longer than those previously estimated. adjusted the depreciation rates for its non-regulated generation property effective July 1, 2010, resulting in a net reduction of depreciation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the net reduction in depreciation expense amounted to $4.8 million ($3.2 million net of tax) and increased diluted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. On an annualized basis, the net reduction in depreciation expense is projected to be approximately $9.6 million ($6.4 million net of tax) or approximately $0.06 per diluted share.

AROs
We recognize AROs in accordance with GAAP which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time those obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a legal liability, costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Our legal obligations associated with the retirement of our long-lived assets consisted primarily of river intake and discharge structures, coal unloading facilities, loading docks, ice breakers and ash disposal facilities. Our generation AROs are recorded within other deferred credits on the balance sheets.
Estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures of this type requires significant judgment. Management routinely updates these estimates as additional information becomes available.
Changes in the Liability for Generation AROs
 
Asset Removal Costs
We continue to record cost of removal for our regulated transmission and distribution assets through our depreciation rates and recover those amounts in rates charged to our customers. There are no known legal AROs associated with these assets. We have recorded $107.9 million and $99.1 million in estimated costs of removal at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as regulatory liabilities for our transmission and distribution property. These amounts represent the excess of the cumulative removal costs recorded through depreciation rates versus the cumulative removal costs actually incurred. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Changes in the Liability for Transmission and Distribution Asset Removal Costs
 
Regulatory Accounting
In accordance with GAAP, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded in the balance sheets for our regulated transmission and distribution businesses. Regulatory assets are the deferral of costs expected to be recovered in future customer rates and Regulatory liabilities represent current recovery of expected future costs.
We evaluate our Regulatory assets each period and believe recovery of these assets is probable. We have received or requested a return on certain regulatory assets for which we are currently recovering or seeking recovery through rates. We record a return after it has been authorized in an order by a regulator. If we were required to terminate application of these GAAP provisions for all of our regulated operations, we would have to write off the amounts of all regulatory assets and liabilities to the statements of results of operations at that time. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at average cost and include coal, limestone, oil and gas used for electric generation, and materials and supplies used for utility operations.
We account for our emission allowances as inventory and record emission allowance inventory at weighted average cost. We calculate the weighted average cost by each vintage (year) for which emission allowances can be used and charge to fuel costs the weighted average cost of emission allowances used each month. Net gains or losses on the sale of excess emission allowances, representing the difference between the sales proceeds and the weighted average cost of emission allowances, are recorded as a component of our fuel costs and are reflected in Operating income when realized. During the periods ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized gains from the sale of emission allowances in the amounts of $0.8 million, $5.0 million and $34.8 million, respectively. Beginning in January 2010, a portion of the gains on emission allowances was used to reduce the overall fuel rider charged to our SSO retail customers.
Income Taxes
GAAP requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes with tax effects of differences, based on currently enacted income tax rates, between the financial reporting and tax basis of accounting reported as deferred tax assets or liabilities in the balance sheets. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.
Investment tax credits, which have been used to reduce federal income taxes payable, are deferred for financial reporting purposes and are amortized over the useful lives of the property to which they relate. For rate-regulated operations, additional deferred income taxes and offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities are recorded to recognize that income taxes will be recoverable or refundable through future revenues.
files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return in conjunction with its subsidiaries. The consolidated tax liability is allocated to each subsidiary based on the separate return method which is specified in our tax allocation agreement and which provides a consistent, systematic and rational approach. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
DPL
 
Financial Instruments
We classify our investments in debt and equity financial instruments of publicly traded entities into different categories: held-to-maturity and available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses on those securities, net of deferred income taxes, are presented as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Other-than-temporary declines in value are recognized currently in earnings. Financial instruments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. The cost basis for public equity security and fixed maturity investments is average cost and amortized cost, respectively.
Short-Term Investments
utilizes VRDNs as part of its short-term investment strategy. The VRDNs are of high credit quality and are secured by irrevocable letters of credit from major financial institutions. VRDN investments have variable rates tied to short-term interest rates. Interest rates are reset every seven days and these VRDNs can be tendered for sale back to the financial institution upon notice. Although VRDN investments have original maturities over one year, they are frequently re-priced and trade at par. We account for these VRDNs as available-for-sale securities and record them as short-term investments at fair value, which approximates cost, since they are highly liquid and are readily available to support current operating needs.

DP&L's
 
Share-Based Compensation
We measure the cost of employee services received and paid with equity instruments based on the fair-value of such equity instrument on the grant date. This cost is recognized in results of operations over the period that employees are required to provide service. Liability awards are initially recorded based on the fair-value of equity instruments and are to be re-measured for the change in stock price at each subsequent reporting date until the liability is ultimately settled. The fair-value for employee share options and other similar instruments at the grant date are estimated using option-pricing models and any excess tax benefits are recognized as an addition to paid-in capital. The reduction in income taxes payable from the excess tax benefits is presented in the statements of cash flows within Cash flows from financing activities. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. All highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.
Financial Derivatives
All derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheets and are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recorded in earnings unless they are designated as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction or qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception.
We use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to changes in energy and commodity prices and as a hedge against the risk of changes in cash flows associated with expected electricity purchases. These purchases are used to hedge our full load requirements. We also hold forward sales contracts that hedge against the risk of changes in cash flows associated with power sales during periods of projected generation facility availability. We use cash flow hedge accounting when the hedge or a portion of the hedge is deemed to be highly effective and MTM accounting when the hedge or a portion of the hedge is not effective. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Insurance and Claims Costs
In addition to insurance obtained from third-party providers, MVIC, a wholly-owned captive subsidiary of , provides insurance coverage to us, our subsidiaries and, in some cases, our partners in commonly owned facilities we operate, for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, and directors' and officers' liability. Insurance and claims costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of include insurance reserves of approximately $10.1 million and $16.2 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Furthermore, is responsible for claim costs below certain coverage thresholds of MVIC for the insurance coverage noted above. In addition, has medical, life, and disability reserves for claims costs below certain coverage thresholds of third-party providers. We record these additional insurance and claims costs of approximately $19.0 million and $11.3 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, within Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits on the balance sheets. The MVIC reserves at and the workers' compensation, medical, life and disability reserves at are actuarially determined based on a reasonable estimation of insured events occurring. There is uncertainty associated with these loss estimates and actual results may differ from the estimates. Modification of these loss estimates based on experience and changed circumstances is reflected in the period in which the estimate is re-evaluated.

In accordance with GAAP, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets for our regulated electric transmission and distribution businesses. Regulatory assets are the deferral of costs expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities represent current recovery of expected future costs or gains probable of recovery being reflected in future rates.
We evaluate our regulatory assets each period and believe recovery of these assets is probable. We have received or requested a return on certain regulatory assets for which we are currently recovering or seeking recovery through rates. We record a return after it has been authorized in an order by a regulator.
Regulatory assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets of and include:
DPL
DP&L
 
 
C  Recovery of incurred costs without a rate of return.
D  Recovery not yet determined, but is probable of occurring in future rate proceedings.
F  Recovery of incurred costs plus rate of return.
Regulatory Assets
represent deferred income tax assets recognized from the normalization of flow through items as the result of amounts previously provided to customers. This is the cumulative flow through benefit given to regulated customers that will be collected from them in future years. Since currently existing temporary differences between the financial statements and the related tax basis of assets will reverse in subsequent periods, these deferred recoverable income taxes will decrease over time.
Deferred recoverable income taxes
represent the qualifying FASC Topic 715 "Compensation  Retirement Benefits" costs of our regulated operations that for ratemaking purposes are deferred for future recovery. We recognize an asset for a plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status, and recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI), the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. This regulatory asset represents the regulated portion that would otherwise be charged as a loss to OCI.
Pension benefits
represents losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed in prior periods. These costs are being amortized over the lives of the original issues in accordance with FERC and PUCO rules.
Unamortized loss on reacquired debt
 
represent costs incurred to modify the customer billing system for unbundled customer rates and electric choice utility bills relative to other generation suppliers and information reports provided to the state administrator of the low-income payment program. In March 2006, the PUCO issued an order that approved our tariff as filed. We began collecting this rider immediately and expect to recover all costs over five years.
Electric Choice systems costs
represent costs incurred to join an RTO. The recovery of these costs will be requested in a future FERC rate case. In accordance with FERC precedence, we are amortizing these costs over a 10-year period that began in 2004 when we joined the PJM RTO.
Regional transmission organization costs
represent the costs related to transmission, ancillary service and other PJM-related charges that have been incurred as a member of PJM. We review retail rates and are required to make true-up adjustments on an annual basis.
TCRR, transmission, ancillary and other PJM-related costs
represent the costs related to PJM RPM assigned to that have not yet been recovered through the RPM rider. We review this rate and make true-up adjustments on an annual basis.
RPM capacity costs

represent costs paid to the State of Ohio since 2002. An application is pending before the PUCO to amend an approved rate rider that had been in effect to collect fees that were paid and deferred in years prior to 2002. The deferred costs incurred prior to 2002 have been fully recovered. As the previously approved rate rider continues to be in effect, we believe these costs are probable of future rate recovery.
Power plant emission fees
represent costs incurred as a result of studying and developing distribution system upgrades and implementation of AMI. Consistent with the ESP Stipulation, re-filed its smart grid and AMI business cases with the PUCO on August 4, 2009 seeking recovery of costs associated with a 10-year plan to deploy smart meters, distribution and substation automation, core telecommunications, supporting software and in-home technologies. On October 19, 2010, elected to withdraw the re-filed case pertaining to the Smart Grid and AMI programs. The PUCO accepted the withdrawal in an order issued on January 5, 2011. The PUCO also indicated that it expects to continue to monitor other utilities' Smart Grid and AMI programs and to explore the potential benefits of investing in Smart Grid and AMI programs and that will, when appropriate, file new Smart Grid and/or AMI business cases in the future. We plan to file to recover these deferred costs in a future regulatory rate proceeding. Based on past PUCO precedent, we believe these costs are probable of future recovery in rates.

Of the December 31, 2010 balance of unrecognized tax benefits, $20.6 million is due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility offset by $1.1 million of unrecognized tax liabilities that would affect the effective tax rate.
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties accrued was an expense of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2010, a benefit of $0.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and an expense of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2008. The amount of interest and penalties recorded in the statements of results of operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was an expense of $0.2 million, and benefits of $0.1 million and $9.0 million, respectively.
Following is a summary of the tax years open to examination by major tax jurisdiction:
U.S. Federal  2007 and forward
State and Local  2005 and forward
None of the unrecognized tax benefits are expected to significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
The Internal Revenue Service began an examination of our 2008 Federal income tax return during the second quarter of 2010. The examination is still ongoing and we do not expect the results of this examination to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
On December 17, 2010, the Federal Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was enacted. This legislation amends, creates and extends various Federal tax statutes. Among the various statutes is the extension and expansion of capital expensing provisions, commonly referred to as bonus depreciation, for 2010, 2011 and 2012. While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, we anticipate they will result in positive cash flow contributions over the next few years.
On June 21, 2010, Ohio Senate Bill 232 was enacted. This legislation eliminates Ohio's tangible personal property tax and real property taxes on generation for renewable and advanced energy project facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2012, produce energy by 2013 (or 2017 for nuclear, clean coal and cogeneration projects) and create Ohio jobs.

On February 13, 2006, we received correspondence from the ODT notifying us that the ODT had completed their examination and review of our Ohio Corporation Franchise Tax Returns for tax years 2002 through 2004 and that the final proposed audit adjustments resulted in a balance due of $90.8 million before interest and penalties. On June 27, 2008, we entered into a $42.0 million settlement agreement with the ODT resolving all outstanding audit issues and appeals, including uncertain tax positions for tax years 1998 through 2006. The $42 million payment was made to the ODT in July 2008. Due to this settlement agreement, the balance of our unrecognized state tax liabilities recorded at December 31, 2007, in the amount of $56.3 million, was reversed resulting in a recorded income tax benefit of $8.5 million, net of federal tax impact, in 2008.
 
sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees. For collective bargaining employees, the defined benefits are based on a specific dollar amount per year of service. For all other employees (management employees), the defined benefit pension plan is based primarily on compensation and years of service. As of December 31, 2010, this pension plan was closed to new management employees. A participant is 100% vested in all amounts credited to his or her account upon the completion of five vesting years, as defined in The Dayton Power and Light Company Retirement Income Plan, or upon a change of control or the participant's death or disability. If a participant's employment is terminated, other than by death or disability, prior to such participant becoming 100% vested in his or her account, the account shall be forfeited as of the date of termination.

Management employees beginning employment on or after January 1, 2011 will be enrolled in a cash balance plan. Similar to the defined benefit pension plan for management employees, the cash balance benefits are based on compensation and years of service. A participant shall become 100% vested in all amounts credited to his or her account upon the completion of three vesting years, as defined in The Dayton Power and Light Company Retirement Income Plan or upon a change of control or the participant's death or disability. If a participant's employment is terminated, other than by death or disability, prior to such participant becoming 100% vested in his or her account, the account shall be forfeited as of the date of termination. Vested benefits in the cash balance plan are fully portable upon termination of employment.
In addition, we have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain active and retired key executives. Benefits under this SERP have been frozen and no additional benefits can be earned. The SERP was replaced by the DPL Inc. Supplemental Executive Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (SEDCRP). The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors designates the eligible employees. Pursuant to the SEDCRP, we provide a supplemental retirement benefit to participants by crediting an account established for each participant in accordance with the Plan requirements. We designate as hypothetical investment funds under the SEDCRP one or more of the investment funds provided under The Dayton Power and Light Company Employee Savings Plan. Each participant may change his or her hypothetical investment fund selection at specified times. If a participant does not elect a hypothetical investment fund(s), then we select the hypothetical investment fund(s) for such participant. We also have an unfunded liability related to agreements for retirement benefits of certain terminated and retired key executives. The unfunded liabilities for these agreements and the SEDCRP were $1.8 million and $1.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
We generally fund pension plan benefits as accrued in accordance with the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and, in addition, make voluntary contributions from time to time. In February 2010, contributed $20.0 million to the defined benefit plan. In September 2010, contributed an additional $20.0 million to the defined benefit plan for a total contribution of $40.0 million in 2010.

Qualified employees who retired prior to 1987 and their dependents are eligible for health care and life insurance benefits until their death, while qualified employees who retired after 1987 are eligible for life insurance benefits and partially subsidized health care. The partially subsidized health care is at the election of the employee, who pays the majority of the cost, and is available only from their retirement until they are covered by Medicare at age 65. We have funded a portion of the union-eligible benefits using a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association Trust.
 
Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded for the portion of the under- or over-funded obligations related to the transmission and distribution areas of our electric business and for the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. These regulatory assets and liabilities represent the regulated portion that would otherwise be charged or credited to AOCI. We have historically recorded these costs on the accrual basis and this is how these costs have been historically recovered. This factor, combined with the historical precedents from the PUCO and FERC, make these costs probable of future rate recovery.
The following tables set forth our pension and postretirement benefit plans' obligations and assets recorded on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The amounts presented in the following tables for pension include both the defined benefit pension plan and the SERP in the aggregate, and use a measurement date of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The amounts presented for postretirement include both health and life insurance benefits and use a measurement date of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligation Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities
 
Estimated amounts that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income, Regulatory assets and Regulatory liabilities into net periodic benefit costs during 2011 are:
 
Our expected return on plan asset assumptions, used to determine benefit obligations, are based on historical long-term rates of return on investments, which use the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors, such as inflation and interest rates, as well as asset diversification and portfolio rebalancing, are evaluated when long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to verify reasonableness and appropriateness.
For 2011, we have decreased our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption from 8.50% to 8.00% for pension plan assets. We are maintaining our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption at approximately 6.00% for postretirement benefit plan assets. These expected returns are based primarily on portfolio investment allocation. There can be no assurance of our ability to generate these rates of return in the future.
 
Our overall discount rate was evaluated in relation to the December 31, 2010 Hewitt Top Quartile Yield Curve which represents a portfolio of top-quartile AA-rated bonds used to settle pension obligations. Peer data and historical returns were also reviewed to verify the reasonableness and appropriateness of our discount rate used in the calculation of benefit obligations and expense.

The following benefit payments, which reflect future service, are expected to be paid as follows:
 
 
We expect to make contributions of $0.4 million to our SERP in 2011 to cover benefit payments. Additionally, we are considering making discretionary contributions of up to $40.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan during 2011. We also expect to contribute $2.5 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2011 to cover benefit payments.
The Pension Protection Act (the Act) of 2006 contained new requirements for our single employer defined benefit pension plan. In addition to establishing a 100% funding target for plan years beginning after December 31, 2008, the Act also limits some benefits if the funded status of pension plans drops below certain thresholds. Among other restrictions under the Act, if the funded status of a plan falls below a predetermined ratio of 80%, lump-sum payments to new retirees are limited to 50% of amounts that otherwise would have been paid and new benefit improvements may not go into effect. For the 2010 plan year, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan as calculated under the requirements of the Act was 99.4% and is estimated to be 99.4% until the 2011 status is certified in September 2011 for the 2011 plan year. The Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (WRERA), which was signed into law on December 23, 2008, grants plan sponsors certain relief from funding requirements and benefit restrictions of the Act.
Plan Assets
Plan assets are invested using a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity securities, debt securities and other investments are used to preserve asset values, diversify risk and achieve our target investment return benchmark. Investment strategies and asset allocations are based on careful consideration of plan liabilities, the plan's funded status and our financial condition. Investment performance and asset allocation are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Plan assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components: an equity portion and a fixed income portion. The expected role of Plan equity investments is to maximize the long-term real growth of Plan assets, while the role of fixed income investments is to generate current income, provide for more stable periodic returns and provide some protection against a prolonged decline in the market value of Plan equity investments.
Long-term strategic asset allocation guidelines are determined by management and take into account the Plan's long-term objectives as well as its short-term constraints. The target allocations for plan assets are 30-80% for equity securities, 30-65% for fixed income securities, 0-10% for cash and 0-25% for alternative investments. Equity securities include U.S. and international equity, while fixed income securities include long-duration and high-yield bond funds and emerging market debt funds. Other types of investments include investments in hedge funds and private equity funds that follow several different strategies.

Master Trust Assets
established a Master Trust to hold assets for the benefit of employees participating in employee benefit plans and these assets are not used for general operating purposes. These assets are primarily comprised of open-ended mutual funds and common stock. The common stock held by the Master Trust is eliminated in consolidation and is not reflected in Consolidated Balance Sheets. The common stock is valued using current public market prices, while the open-ended mutual funds are valued using the net asset value per unit. These investments are recorded at fair value within Other assets on the balance sheets and classified as available for sale. Any unrealized gains or losses are recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold.

VRDN investments have variable rates tied to short-term interest rates. Interest rates are reset every seven days and these VRDNs can be tendered for sale upon notice back to the financial institution. Although VRDN investments have original maturities over one year, they are frequently re-priced and trade at par. We account for these VRDNs as available-for-sale securities and record them as short-term investments at fair value, which approximates cost, since they are highly liquid and are readily available to support current operating needs.

The following table discloses the fair value and redemption frequency for those assets whose fair value is estimated using the NAV per unit as of December 31, 2010. These assets are part of the Master Trust and exclude common stock which is valued using quoted market prices and not the NAV per unit. Fair values estimated using the NAV per unit are considered Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, unless they cannot be redeemed at the NAV per unit on the reporting date. Investments that have restrictions on the redemption of the investments are Level 3 inputs. As of December 31, 2010, did not have any investments for sale at a price different from the NAV per unit.

Fair Value Hierarchy
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. These inputs are then categorized as Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); Level 2 (observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active); or Level 3 (unobservable inputs).
Valuations of assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including the values associated with counterparty risk. We include our own credit risk and our counterparty's credit risk in our calculation of fair value using global average default rates based on an annual study conducted by a large rating agency.
 
We did not have any transfers of the fair values of our financial instruments between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The fair value of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 measured on a recurring basis and the respective category within the fair value hierarchy for was determined as follows:

We use the market approach to value our financial instruments. Level 1 inputs are used for common stock held by the Master Trust and for derivative contracts such as heating oil futures and natural gas futures. The fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. Level 2 inputs are used to value derivatives such as financial transmission rights (where the quoted prices are from a relatively inactive market), forward power contracts and forward NYMEX-quality coal contracts (which are traded on the OTC market but which are valued using prices on the NYMEX for similar contracts on the OTC market). VRDNs and bonds are considered Level 2 because they are priced using recent transactions for similar assets. Other Level 2 assets include: open-ended mutual funds that are in the Master Trust, which are valued using the end of day NAV per unit, and interest rate hedges, which use observable inputs to populate a pricing model.
DPL
Approximately 99% of the inputs to the fair value of our derivative instruments are from quoted market prices.
Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements
We use the cost approach to determine the fair value of our AROs which are estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value at the initial recording of the liability. Cash outflows are based on the approximate future disposal cost as determined by market information, historical information or other management estimates. These inputs to the fair value of the AROs would be considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. There were $1.4 million and $2.7 million of gross additions to our existing landfill and asbestos AROs during the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. In addition, it was determined that a river structure would be retired earlier than previously estimated. This resulted in a partial reduction to the ARO liability of $0.8 million in 2010.
Cash Equivalents

In the normal course of business, and enter into various financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for commodities and interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt. The derivatives that we use to economically hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward and futures contracts. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The objective of the hedging program is to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that we have adequate resources to meet our requirements. We monitor and value derivative positions monthly as part of our risk management processes. We use published sources for pricing, when possible, to mark positions to market. All of our derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes and are designated as cash flow hedges or marked to market each reporting period.

The fair value of cash flow hedges as determined by current public market prices will continue to fluctuate with changes in market prices up to contract expiration. The effective portion of the hedging transaction is recognized in AOCI and transferred to earnings using specific identification of each contract when the forecasted hedged transaction takes place or when the forecasted hedged transaction is probable of not occurring. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings in the current period. All risk components were taken into account to determine the hedge effectiveness of the cash flow hedges.
We enter into forward power contracts to manage commodity price risk exposure related to our generation of electricity. We do not hedge all commodity price risk. We reclassify gains and losses on forward power contracts from AOCI into earnings in those periods in which the contracts settle.
We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to anticipated borrowings of fixed-rate debt. Our anticipated fixed-rate debt offerings have a high probability of occurrence as the proceeds will be used to fund existing debt maturities and projected capital expenditures. We do not hedge all interest rate exposure. As of December 31, 2010, we have entered into interest rate hedging relationships with aggregate notional amounts of $200 million and $160 million related to planned future borrowing activities in calendar years 2011 and 2013, respectively. We reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to our debt financings from AOCI into earnings in those periods in which hedged interest payments occur.

Mark to Market Accounting
Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis as part of our risk management program but do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchases and sales exceptions under FASC Topic 815. Accordingly, such contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in the fair value charged or credited to the consolidated statements of results of operations in the period in which the change occurred. This is commonly referred to as "MTM accounting." Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, by physical delivery or net settled with the counterparty. We mark to market FTRs, heating oil futures, forward NYMEX-quality coal contracts, natural gas futures and certain forward power contracts.
Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts, as provided under GAAP. Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under GAAP are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized in the consolidated statements of results of operations on an accrual basis.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
In accordance with regulatory accounting under GAAP, a cost that is probable of recovery in future rates should be deferred as a regulatory asset and a gain that is probable of being returned to customers should be deferred as a regulatory liability. Portions of the derivative contracts that are marked to market each reporting period and are related to the retail portion of load requirements are included as part of the fuel and purchased power recovery rider approved by the PUCO which began January 1, 2010. Therefore, the Ohio retail customers' portion of the heating oil futures and the NYMEX-quality coal contracts are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts settle. If these unrealized gains and losses are no longer deemed to be probable of recovery through our rates, they will be reclassified into earnings in the period such determination is made.

Certain of our OTC commodity derivative contracts are under master netting agreements that contain provisions that require our debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, we would be in violation of these provisions, and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization of the MTM loss. The aggregate fair value of all commodity derivative instruments that are in a MTM loss position at December 31, 2010 is $3.1 million. This amount is offset by $1.0 million in a broker margin account which offsets our loss positions on the NYMEX Clearport traded forward power contracts. This liability position is further offset by the asset position of counterparties with master netting agreements of $0.2 million. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, we may have to post collateral for the remaining $1.9 million.
 
In April 2006, shareholders approved The DPL Inc. Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (the EPIP) which became immediately effective and will remain in effect for a term of ten years, unless terminated sooner in accordance with its terms. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will designate the employees and directors eligible to participate in the EPIP and the times and types of awards to be granted. Under the EPIP, the Compensation Committee may grant equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and units, and other stock-based awards. Awards may be subject to the achievement of certain management objectives. In addition, the EPIP provides, upon recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board, for a grant of a special equity award to recognize outstanding performance. A total of 4,500,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the EPIP.

Determining Fair Value
We estimate the fair value of stock options and RSUs using a Black-Scholes-Merton model; performance shares are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation; restricted shares are valued at the closing market price on the day of grant and the Directors' RSUs are valued at the closing market price on the day prior to the grant date. We amortize the fair value of all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting periods.
Valuation and Amortization Method 
Our expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of common stock. The volatility range captures the high and low volatility values for each award granted based on its specific terms.
Expected Volatility 
DPL
The expected life assumption represents the estimated period of time from the grant date until the exercise date and reflects historical employee exercise patterns.
Expected Life 
The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of the valuation for U.S. Treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the award, i.e., a five year bond rate is used for valuing an award with a five year expected life.
Risk-Free Interest Rate 
The expected dividend yield is based on current dividend rate, adjusted as necessary to capture anticipated dividend changes and the 12 month average common stock price.

Regulation Matters Related to Air Quality
Clean Air Act Compliance
In 1990, the federal government amended the CAA to further regulate air pollution. Under the law, the USEPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States. The CAA allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. The CAA has a material effect on our operations and such effects are detailed below with respect to certain programs under the CAA.
On October 27, 2003, the USEPA published final rules regarding the equipment replacement provision (ERP) of the routine maintenance, repair and replacement (RMRR) exclusion of the CAA. Activities at power plants that fall within the scope of the RMRR exclusion do not trigger new source review (NSR) requirements, including the imposition of stricter emission limits. On December 24, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stayed the effective date of the rule pending its decision on the merits of the lawsuits filed by numerous states and environmental organizations challenging the final rules. On June 6, 2005, the USEPA issued its final response on the reconsideration of the ERP exclusion. The USEPA clarified its position, but did not change any aspect of the 2003 final rules. This decision was appealed and the D.C. Circuit vacated the final rules on March 17, 2006. The scope of the RMRR exclusion remains uncertain due to this action by the D.C. Circuit, as well as multiple litigations not directly involving us where courts are defining the scope of the exception with respect to the specific facts and circumstances of the particular power plants and activities before the courts. While we believe that we have not engaged in any activities with respect to our existing power plants that would trigger the NSR requirements, if NSR requirements were imposed on any of existing power plants, the results could have a material adverse impact to us.
DP&L's
The USEPA issued a proposed rule on October 20, 2005 concerning the test for measuring whether modifications to electric generating units should trigger application of NSR standards under the CAA. A supplemental rule was also proposed on May 8, 2007 to include additional options for determining if there is an emissions increase when an existing electric generating unit makes a physical or operational change. The rule was challenged by environmental organizations and has not been finalized. While we cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking, any finalized rules could materially affect our operations.
Interstate Air Quality Rule
On December 17, 2003, the USEPA proposed the Interstate Air Quality Rule (IAQR) designed to reduce and permanently cap SO
2
and NOx emissions from electric utilities. The proposed IAQR focused on states, including Ohio, whose power plant emissions are believed to be significantly contributing to fine particle and ozone pollution in other downwind states in the eastern United States. On June 10, 2004, the USEPA issued a supplemental proposal to the IAQR, now renamed the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The final rules were signed on March 10, 2005 and were published on May 12, 2005. CAIR created an interstate trading program for annual NOx emission allowances and made modifications to an existing trading program for SO
2
. On August 24, 2005, the USEPA proposed additional revisions to the CAIR. On July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision to vacate the USEPA's CAIR and its associated Federal Implementation Plan and remanded to the USEPA with instructions to issue new regulations that conformed with the procedural and substantive requirements of the CAA. The Court's decision, in part, invalidated the new NOx annual emission allowance trading program and the modifications to the SO
2
emission trading program established by the March 10, 2005 rules, and created uncertainty regarding future NOx and SO
2
emission reduction requirements and their timing. The USEPA and a group representing utilities filed a request on September 24, 2008 for a rehearing before the entire Court. On December 23, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an order on reconsideration that permits CAIR to remain in effect until the USEPA issues new regulations that would conform to the CAA requirements and the Court's July 11, 2008 decision.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, began a program for selling excess emission allowances, including annual NOx emission allowances and SO
DP&L
2
emission allowances that were the subject of CAIR trading programs. In subsequent quarters, recognized gains from the sale of excess emission allowances to third parties. The Court's CAIR decision affected the trading market for excess allowances and impacted program for selling additional excess allowances in 2008. In January 2009, we resumed selling excess allowances due to the revival of the emissions trading market. On July 6, 2010, the USEPA proposed the Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) which will effectively replace CAIR. We have reviewed this proposal and submitted comments to the USEPA on September 30, 2010. We are unable to determine the overall financial impact that these rules could have on our operations in the future.

In 2007, the Ohio EPA revised their State Implementation Plan (SIP) to incorporate a CAIR program consistent with the IAQR. The Ohio EPA had received partial approval from the USEPA and had been awaiting full program approval from the USEPA when the U.S. Court of Appeals issued its July 11, 2008 decision. As a result of the December 23, 2008 order, the Ohio EPA proposed revised rules on May 11, 2009, which were finalized on July 15, 2009. On September 25, 2009, the USEPA issued a full SIP approval for the Ohio CAIR program. We do not expect that full SIP approval of the Ohio CAIR program will have a significant impact on operations.
Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants
On January 30, 2004, the USEPA published its proposal to restrict mercury and other air toxins from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants. The USEPA "de-listed" mercury as a hazardous air pollutant from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants and, instead, proposed a cap-and-trade approach to regulate the total amount of mercury emissions allowed from such sources. The final Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) was signed March 15, 2005 and was published on May 18, 2005. On March 29, 2005, nine states sued the USEPA, opposing the cap-and-trade regulatory approach taken by the USEPA. In 2007, the Ohio EPA adopted rules implementing the CAMR program. On February 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the USEPA regulations, finding that the USEPA had not complied with statutory requirements applicable to "de-listing" a hazardous air pollutant and that a cap-and-trade approach was not authorized by law for "listed" hazardous air pollutants. A request for rehearing before the entire Court of Appeals was denied and a petition for review before the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on October 17, 2008. On February 23, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition. The USEPA is expected to propose Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for coal- and oil-fired electric generating units during the quarter ending March 31, 2011 and finalize during the quarter ending December 31, 2011. Upon publication in the federal register following finalization, affected electric generating units (EGUs) will have three years to come into compliance with the new requirements. is unable to determine the impact of the promulgation of new MACT standards on its financial condition or results of operations; however, a MACT standard could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot predict the final costs we may incur to comply with proposed new regulations to control mercury or other hazardous air pollutants.

On April 29, 2010, the USEPA issued a proposed rule that would reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from new and existing industrial, commercial and institutional boilers, and process heaters at major and area source facilities. This regulation may affect five auxiliary boilers used for start-up purposes at generation facilities. The proposed regulations contain emissions limitations, operating limitations and other requirements. The compliance schedule will be three years from the date when these rules, if finalized, become effective. We currently cannot determine whether or not these rules will be finalized nor can we predict the effect of compliance costs, if any, on operations. Such costs, however, are not expected to be material.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards
On January 5, 2005, the USEPA published its final non-attainment designations for the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for Fine Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5). These designations included counties and partial counties in which operates and/or owns generating facilities. On March 4, 2005, and other Ohio electric utilities and electric generators filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the final rule creating these designations. On November 30, 2005, the court ordered the USEPA to decide on all petitions for reconsideration by January 20, 2006. On January 20, 2006, the USEPA denied the petitions for reconsideration. On July 7, 2009, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the USEPA non-attainment designations for the areas impacting generation plants, however, on October 8, 2009 the USEPA issued new designations based on 2008 monitoring data that showed all areas in attainment to the standard with the exception of several counties in northeastern Ohio. The USEPA is expected to propose revisions to the PM 2.5 standard during the first quarter of 2011 as part of its routine five-year rule review cycle. We cannot predict the impact the revisions to the PM 2.5 standard will have on financial condition or results of operations.

On May 5, 2004, the USEPA issued its proposed regional haze rule, which addresses how states should determine the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for sources covered under the regional haze rule. Final rules were published July 6, 2005, providing states with several options for determining whether sources in the state should be subject to BART. In the final rule, the USEPA made the determination that CAIR achieves greater progress than BART and may be used by states as a BART substitute. Numerous units owned and operated by us will be impacted by BART. We cannot determine the extent of the impact until Ohio determines how BART will be implemented.
On September 16, 2009, the USEPA announced that it would reconsider the 2008 national ground level ozone standard. A more stringent ambient ozone standard may lead to stricter NOx emission standards in the future. cannot determine the effect of this potential change, if any, on its operations.

Climate Change
In response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that the USEPA has the authority to regulate CO
2
emissions from motor vehicles, the USEPA made a finding that CO
2
and certain other GHGs are pollutants under the CAA. Subsequently, under the CAA, USEPA determined that CO
2
and other GHGs from motor vehicles threaten the health and welfare of future generations by contributing to climate change. This finding became effective in January 2010. Numerous affected parties have petitioned the USEPA Administrator to reconsider this decision. On April 1, 2010, USEPA signed the "Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards" rule. Under USEPA's view, this is the final action that renders carbon dioxide and other GHGs "regulated air pollutants" under the CAA. As a result of this action, it is expected that in 2011 various permitting programs will apply to other combustion sources, such as coal-fired power plants. We cannot predict the effect of this change, if any, on operations.

Litigation Involving Co-Owned Plants
In 2004, eight states and the City of New York filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York against American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP), one of AEP's subsidiaries, Cinergy Corp. (a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation (Duke Energy)) and four other electric power companies. A similar lawsuit was filed against these companies in the same court by Open Space Institute, Inc., Open Space Conservancy, Inc. and The Audubon Society of New Hampshire. The lawsuits allege that the companies' emissions of CO

contribute to global warming and constitute a public or private nuisance. The lawsuits seek injunctive relief in the form of specific emission reduction commitments. In 2005, the Federal District Court dismissed the lawsuits, holding that the lawsuits raised political questions that should not be decided by the courts. The plaintiffs appealed. Finding that the plaintiffs have standing to sue and can assert federal common law nuisance claims, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on September 21, 2009 vacated the dismissal of the Federal District Court and remanded the lawsuits back to the Federal District Court for further proceedings.

Clean Water Act  Regulation of Water Discharge
On May 4, 2004, the Ohio EPA issued a final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit (the Permit) for J.M. Stuart Station that continued our authority to discharge water from the station into the Ohio River. During the three-year term of the Permit, we conducted a thermal discharge study to evaluate the technical feasibility and economic reasonableness of water cooling methods other than cooling towers. In December 2006, we submitted an application for the renewal of the Permit that was due to expire on June 30, 2007. In July 2007, we received a draft permit proposing to continue our authority to discharge water from the station into the Ohio River. On February 5, 2008, we received a letter from the Ohio EPA indicating that they intended to impose a compliance schedule as part of the final Permit, that requires us to implement one of two diffuser options for the discharge of water from the station into the Ohio River as identified in the thermal discharge study. Subsequently, representatives from and the Ohio EPA agreed to allow to restrict public access to the water discharge area as an alternative to installing one of the diffuser options. Ohio EPA issued a revised draft permit that was received on November 12, 2008.

Rehearings were filed by other interested litigants and denied by the Court, which then remanded the matter to the FERC for further proceedings. On January 21, 2010, the FERC issued a procedural order on remand establishing a paper hearing process under which PJM will make an informational filing in late February. Subsequently PJM and other parties, including , filed initial comments, testimony, and recommendations and reply comments. FERC did not establish a deadline for its issuance of a substantive order and the matter is still pending.  cannot predict the timing or the likely outcome of the proceeding. Until such time as FERC may act to approve a change in methodology, PJM will continue to apply the allocation methodology that had been approved by FERC in 2007. Although we continue to maintain that these costs should be borne by the beneficiaries of these projects and that is not one of these beneficiaries, any new credits or additional costs resulting from the ultimate outcome of this proceeding will be reflected in TCRR rider which already includes these costs.

In connection with and other utilities joining PJM, in 2006 the FERC ordered utilities to eliminate certain charges to implement transitional payments, known as SECA, effective December 1, 2004 through March 31, 2006, subject to refund. Through this proceeding, was obligated to pay SECA charges to other utilities, but received a net benefit from these transitional payments. A hearing was held and an initial decision was issued in August 2006. A final FERC order on this issue was issued on May 21, 2010 that substantially supports and other utilities' position that SECA obligations should be paid by parties that used the transmission system during the timeframe stated above. , along with other transmission owners in PJM and the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) made a compliance filing at FERC on August 19, 2010 that fully demonstrated all payment obligations to and from all parties within PJM and the MISO. The FERC has made no ruling regarding the compliance filing and some parties have requested rehearing by FERC of its May 21, 2010 order. It is expected that any order on the compliance filing and any order regarding the rehearing request will be appealed for Court review. Prior to this final order being issued, entered into a significant number of bi-lateral settlement agreements with certain parties to resolve the matter, which by design will be unaffected by the final decision. Further, in October 2010, entered into another settlement agreement to settle a portion of

With respect to unsettled claims, management believes it has deferred as a regulatory liability the appropriate amounts that are subject to refund (see SECA net revenue subject to refund within Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and therefore the results of this proceeding are not expected to have a material adverse effect on results of operations.

Initiatives taken by state legislative bodies combined with changes in the market price of electricity have significantly impacted the manner in which electric utilities in certain parts of the United States, including Ohio, have traditionally conducted business. This has resulted in, among other things, a more competitive electricity marketplace. Accordingly, increased its resources to participate in the more competitive retail electric service market. believes that these reportable segments are consistent with how our management views its business and makes decisions on how to allocate resources and evaluate performance.

The Competitive Retail segment is comprised of DPLER's competitive retail electric service business which sells retail electric energy under contract primarily to commercial and industrial customers who have selected DPLER as their alternative electric supplier. The Competitive Retail segment sells electricity to approximately 9,000 customers currently located throughout Ohio. Due to increased competition in Ohio, during 2010 we increased the number of employees and resources assigned to manage DPLER and increased its marketing to customers. The Competitive Retail segment's electric energy used to meet its sales obligations was purchased from . During 2010, we implemented a new wholesale agreement between and DPLER. Under this agreement, intercompany sales from to DPLER were based on the market prices for wholesale power. In periods prior to 2010, DPLER's purchases from were transacted at prices that approximated DPLER's sales prices to its end-use retail customers. The Competitive Retail segment has no transmission or generation assets.

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of DPL Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related Consolidated Statements of Results of Operations, Shareholders' Equity and Cash Flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have audited the consolidated financial statement schedule, "Schedule II  Valuation and Qualifying Accounts." We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements, the financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Certain immaterial amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current reporting presentation.
Deferred SECA revenue of $15.4 million at December 31, 2010 was reclassified from Regulatory liabilities to Other deferred credits. The balance of deferred SECA revenue at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $14.1 million and $15.4 million, respectively. The FERC-approved SECA billings are unearned revenue where the earnings process is not complete and do not represent a potential overpayment by retail ratepayers or potential refunds of costs that had been previously charged to retail ratepayers through rates. Therefore, any amounts that are ultimately collected related to these charges would not be a reduction to future rates charged to retail ratepayers and therefore do not meet the criteria for recording as a regulatory liability under GAAP. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information relating to SECA.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial statements and with the instructions of Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted from this interim report. Therefore, our interim financial statements in this report should be read along with the annual financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.
In the opinion of our management, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report contain all adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial condition as of September 30, 2011; our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011; and our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Unless otherwise noted, all adjustments are normal and recurring in nature. Due to various factors, including but not limited to, seasonal weather variations, the timing of outages of electric generating units, changes in economic conditions involving commodity prices and competition, and other factors, interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 may not be indicative of our results that will be realized for the full year ending December 31, 2011.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the revenues and expenses of the periods reported. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of derivative instruments; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for receivables and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; reserves recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits.
Property, Plant and Equipment
We record our ownership share of our undivided interest in jointly-held plants as an asset in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. For regulated transmission and distribution property, cost includes direct labor and material, allocable overhead expenses and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). AFUDC represents the cost of borrowed funds and equity used to finance regulated construction projects. Capitalization of AFUDC ceases at either project completion or at the date specified by regulators. AFUDC capitalized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 was not material.
 
For unregulated generation property, cost includes direct labor and material, allocable overhead expenses and interest capitalized during construction using the provisions of GAAP relating to the accounting for capitalized interest.
For substantially all depreciable property, when a unit of property is retired, the original cost of that property less any salvage value is charged to Accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Property is evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.
At September 30, 2011, neither nor had any material plant acquisition adjustments or other plant-related adjustments.

Depreciation Study  Change in Estimate
Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method, which allocates the cost of property over its estimated useful life. For generation, transmission and distribution assets, straight-line depreciation is applied monthly on an average composite basis using group rates. In July 2010, completed a depreciation rate study for non-regulated generation property based on its property, plant and equipment balances at December 31, 2009, with certain adjustments for subsequent property additions. The results of the depreciation study concluded that many of composite depreciation rates should be reduced due to projected useful asset lives which are longer than those previously estimated. adjusted the depreciation rates for its non-regulated generation property effective July 1, 2010, resulting in a net reduction of depreciation expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the reduction was $4.8 million ($3.1 million, net of tax) and increased diluted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. The net reduction in depreciation expense for the twelve months ended September 30, 2011 was $7.2 million ($4.7 million net of tax) or $0.04 per diluted share.

Short-Term Investments
utilizes VRDNs as part of its short-term investment strategy. The VRDNs are of high credit quality and are secured by irrevocable letters of credit from major financial institutions. VRDN investments have variable rates tied to short-term interest rates. Interest rates are reset every seven days and these VRDNs can be tendered for sale back to the financial institution upon notice. Although VRDN investments have original maturities over one year, they are frequently re-priced and trade at par. We account for these VRDNs as available-for-sale securities and record them as short-term investments at fair value, which approximates cost, since they are highly liquid and are readily available to support current operating needs.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Fair Value Disclosures
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04 "Fair Value Measurements" (ASU 2011-04) effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We expect to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2012. This standard updates FASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements." ASU 2011-04 essentially converges US GAAP guidance on fair value with the IFRS guidance. The ASU requires more disclosures around Level 3 inputs. It also increases reporting for financial instruments disclosed at fair value but not recorded at fair value and provides clarification of blockage factors and other premiums and discounts. We do not expect these new rules to have a material impact on our overall results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Comprehensive Income
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05 "Presentation of Comprehensive Income" (ASU 2011-05) effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We expect to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2012. This standard updates FASC Topic 220, "Comprehensive Income." ASU 2011-05 and essentially converges US GAAP guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income with the IFRS guidance. The ASU requires the presentation of comprehensive income in one continuous financial statement or two separate but consecutive statements. Any reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income are required to be presented on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. We do not expect these new rules to have a material impact on our overall results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Goodwill Impairment
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08 "Testing Goodwill for Impairment" (ASU 2011-08) effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We expect to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2012. This standard updates FASC Topic 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other." ASU 2011-08 allows an entity to first test Goodwill using qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has been impaired, then the two-step impairment test is not performed. We do not expect these new rules to have a material impact on our overall results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In accordance with GAAP, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for our regulated electric transmission and distribution businesses. Regulatory assets are the deferral of costs expected to be recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities represent current recovery of expected future costs or gains probable of being reflected in future rates.
We evaluate our regulatory assets each period and believe recovery of these assets is probable. We have received or requested a return on certain regulatory assets for which we are currently recovering or seeking recovery through rates. We record a return after it has been authorized in an order by a regulator.
Economic Development Contract
On March 4, 2011, applied for approval from the PUCO of an arrangement entered into with largest customer. Under the terms of this arrangement, all of the retail electric energy services of this customer will be provided by through December 31, 2011. Subject to certain terms and conditions, this arrangement may be extended beyond December 31, 2011; however, its total duration is not to exceed 42 months. This arrangement was approved by the PUCO on June 8, 2011 and became effective in July 2011. On October 26, 2011, the PUCO approved our Economic Development Rider, as filed, which is designed to recover costs associated with this and other economic development contracts and programs.

Regulatory assets and liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets include:
REGULATORY MATTERS
 
 
C  Recovery of incurred costs without a rate of return.
D  Recovery not yet determined, but is probable of occurring in future rate proceedings.
F  Recovery of incurred costs plus rate of return.
Regulatory Assets
represent deferred income tax assets recognized from the normalization of flow through items as a result of amounts previously provided to customers. This is the cumulative flow through benefit given to regulated customers that will be collected from them in future years. Since currently existing temporary differences between the financial statements and the related tax basis of assets will reverse in subsequent periods, these deferred recoverable income taxes will decrease over time.
Deferred recoverable income taxes
 
represent the qualifying FASC Topic 715 "Compensation  Retirement Benefits" costs of our regulated operations that for ratemaking purposes are deferred for future recovery. We recognize an asset for a plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status, and recognize, as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI), the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. This regulatory asset represents the regulated portion that would otherwise be charged as a loss to OCI.
Pension benefits
represents losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed in prior periods. These costs are being amortized over the lives of the original issues in accordance with FERC and PUCO rules.
Unamortized loss on reacquired debt
represent costs incurred to join an RTO. The recovery of these costs will be requested in a future FERC rate case. In accordance with FERC precedent, we are amortizing these costs over a 10-year period that began in 2004 when we joined the PJM RTO.
Regional transmission organization costs
represent the costs related to transmission, ancillary service and other PJM-related charges that have been incurred as a member of PJM. On an annual basis, retail rates are adjusted to true-up costs with recovery in rates.
TCRR, transmission, ancillary and other PJM-related costs
relate to costs incurred to repair the damage caused by hurricane force winds in September 2008, as well as other major 2008 storms. On January 14, 2009, the PUCO granted the authority to defer these costs with a return until such time that seeks recovery in a future rate proceeding.
Deferred storm costs  2008

DP&L
represent costs paid to the State of Ohio since 2002. An application is pending before the PUCO to amend an approved rate rider that had been in effect to collect fees that were paid and deferred in years prior to 2002. The deferred costs incurred prior to 2002 have been fully recovered. As the previously approved rate rider continues to be in effect, we believe these costs are probable of future rate recovery.
Power plant emission fees
represent costs incurred as a result of studying and developing distribution system upgrades and implementation of AMI. On October 19, 2010, elected to withdraw its case pertaining to the Smart Grid and AMI programs. The PUCO accepted the withdrawal in an order issued on January 5, 2011. The PUCO also indicated that it expects to continue to monitor other utilities' Smart Grid and AMI programs and to explore the potential benefits of investing in Smart Grid and AMI programs and that will, when appropriate, file new Smart Grid and/or AMI business cases in the future. We plan to file to recover these deferred costs in a future regulatory rate proceeding. Based on past PUCO precedent, we believe these costs are probable of future recovery in rates.
CCEM smart grid and AMI costs

DP&L
represent costs incurred to develop and implement various new customer programs addressing energy efficiency. These costs are being recovered through an energy efficiency rider that began July 1, 2009 and is subject to a two-year true-up for any over/under recovery of costs.
CCEM energy efficiency program costs
primarily include consumer education advertising costs regarding electric deregulation, settlement system costs, electric choice system, RPM capacity, other PJM and rate case costs and alternative energy costs that are or will be recovered over various periods.
Other costs
Regulatory Liabilities
reflects an estimate of amounts collected in customer rates for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future to remove existing transmission and distribution property from service when the property is retired.
Estimated costs of removal  regulated property
 
represent the qualifying FASC Topic 715 "Compensation  Retirement Benefits" gains related to our regulated operations that, for ratemaking purposes, are probable of being reflected in future rates. We recognize an asset for a plan's overfunded status or a liability for a plan's underfunded status, and recognize, as a component of OCI, the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. This regulatory liability represents the regulated portion that would otherwise be reflected as a gain to OCI.
Postretirement benefits
represent prudently incurred fuel, purchased power, derivative, emission and other related costs which will be recovered from or returned to customers in the future through the operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery rider. The fuel and purchased power recovery rider fluctuates based on actual costs and recoveries and is modified at the start of each seasonal quarter. implemented the fuel and purchased power recovery rider on January 1, 2010. recently underwent an audit of its fuel and purchased power recovery rider but there is some uncertainty as to the costs that will be recovered from or returned to customers. Independent third parties conducted the fuel audit in accordance with PUCO standards. On October 6, 2011, and all of the active participants in this proceeding reached a Stipulation and Recommendation that resolves the majority of the issues raised by the auditor. On October 19, 2011, we had a hearing on this case. Although the Stipulation and Recommendation was uncontested, the PUCO may approve, disapprove, or modify the stipulation. expects to record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment to earnings after the final order is received.

The following table details the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.
 
Income tax expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 were calculated using the estimated annual effective income tax rates for 2011 and 2010 and reflect estimated annual effective income tax rates of 33.2% and 32.6%, respectively. Management estimates the annual effective tax rate based upon its forecast of annual pre-tax income. To the extent that actual pre-tax results for the year differ from the forecasts applied to the most recent interim period, the rates estimated could be materially different from the actual effective tax rates recognized.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, current period effective tax rate is less than the estimated annual effective tax rate due to certain current period tax adjustments including a revision to the estimated annual effective tax rate. These current period adjustments resulting in tax expense being reduced by $2.6 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. The current period adjustments are primarily due to the effect of estimate-to-actual income tax provision adjustments related to the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction, ESOP related deductions and flow-through related deductions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the reductions to the current period effective tax rate are partially offset by increased state income tax expense of $2.0 million recorded as a result of the acquisition of MC Squared.

sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for the vast majority of its employees. For collective bargaining employees, the defined benefits are based on a specific dollar amount per year of service. For all other employees (management employees), the defined benefit pension plan is based primarily on compensation and years of service. As of December 31, 2010, this existing pension plan was closed to new management employees. A participant is 100% vested in all amounts credited to his or her account upon the completion of five vesting years, as defined in The Dayton Power and Light Company Retirement Income Plan, or the participant's death or disability. If a participant's employment is terminated, other than by death or disability, prior to such participant becoming 100% vested in his or her account, the account shall be forfeited as of the date of termination.

If a participant's employment is terminated, other than by death or disability, prior to such participant becoming 100% vested in his or her account, the account shall be forfeited as of the date of termination. Vested benefits in the cash balance plan are fully portable upon termination of employment.

The fair values of our financial instruments are based on published sources for pricing when possible. We rely on valuation models only when no other methods exist. The fair value of our financial instruments represents estimates of possible value that may not be realized in the future. The table below presents the fair value and cost of our non-derivative instruments at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. See also Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the fair values of our derivative instruments.

Debt is shown at fair value based on current public market prices for disclosure purposes only. Unrealized gains or losses are not recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as debt is presented at amortized cost in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The debt amounts include the current portion payable in the next twelve months and have maturities that range from 2011 to 2061.
Master Trust Assets
established a Master Trust to hold assets for the benefit of directors and employees participating in employee benefit plans. These assets are not used for general operating purposes and are primarily comprised of open-ended mutual funds and common stock. The common stock held by the Master Trust is eliminated in consolidation and is not reflected in Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The common stock is valued using current public market prices, while the open-ended mutual funds are valued using the net asset value per unit. These investments are recorded at fair value within Other deferred assets on the balance sheets and classified as available for sale. Any unrealized gains or losses are recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold.

The VRDNs are of high credit quality and are secured by irrevocable letters of credit from major financial institutions. VRDN investments have variable rates tied to short-term interest rates. Interest rates are reset every seven days and these VRDNs can be tendered for sale back to the financial institution upon notice. Although VRDN investments have original maturities over one year, they are frequently re-priced and trade at par. We account for these VRDNs as available-for-sale securities and record them as short-term investments at fair value, which approximates cost, since they are highly liquid and are readily available to support current operating needs.

These assets are part of the Master Trust and exclude common stock which is valued using quoted market prices and not the NAV. Fair values estimated using the NAV per unit are considered Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, unless they cannot be redeemed at the NAV on the reporting date. Investments that have restrictions on the redemption of the investments are Level 3 inputs. As of September 30, 2011, did not have any investments for sale at a price different than the NAV per unit.

Fair Value Hierarchy
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. These inputs are then categorized as Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); Level 2 (observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices in markets that are not active); or Level 3 (unobservable inputs).
Valuations of assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including the values associated with counterparty risk. We include our own credit risk and our counterparty's credit risk in our calculation of fair value using global average default rates based on an annual study conducted by a large rating agency.
We did not have any transfers of the fair values of our financial instruments between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.
The fair value of assets and liabilities at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 measured on a recurring basis and the respective category within the fair value hierarchy for was determined as follows:

We use the market approach to value our financial instruments. Level 1 inputs are used for common stock held by the Master Trust and for derivative contracts such as heating oil futures. The fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions. Level 2 inputs are used to value derivatives such as financial transmission rights (where the quoted prices are from a relatively inactive market) and forward power contracts and NYMEX-quality coal contracts (which are traded on the OTC market but which are valued using prices on the NYMEX for similar contracts on the OTC market). VRDNs and bonds are considered Level 2 because they are priced using recent transactions for similar assets. Other Level 2 assets include open-ended mutual funds that are in the Master Trust, which are valued using the end of day NAV per unit and interest rate hedges, which use observable inputs to populate a pricing model.
DPL
Approximately 98% and 87% of the inputs to the fair value of our derivative instruments are from quoted market prices for and , respectively.
DPL
DP&L
Non-recurring fair value measurements
We use the cost approach to determine the fair value of our AROs which are estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value at the initial recording of the liability. Cash outflows are based on the approximate future disposal cost as determined by market information, historical information or other management estimates. These inputs to the fair value of the AROs would be considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. There were no additions to our existing AROs during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2011.
Cash Equivalents
DPL had no money in money market funds at September 30, 2011 and $29.9 million in money market funds at December 31, 2010 classified as cash and cash equivalents in its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The money market funds have quoted prices that are generally equivalent to par.
 
In the normal course of business, and enter into various financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments. We use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for commodities. The derivatives that we use to economically hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward and futures contracts. Our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required. The objective of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that we have adequate resources to meet our requirements. We monitor and value derivative positions monthly as part of our risk management processes. We use published sources for pricing when possible to mark positions to market. All of our derivative instruments are used for risk management purposes and are designated as a cash flow hedge or marked to market each reporting period.

Cash Flow Hedges
As part of our risk management processes, we identify the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The fair value of cash flow hedges as determined by current public market prices will continue to fluctuate with changes in market prices up to contract expiration. The effective portion of the hedging transaction is recognized in AOCI and transferred to earnings using specific identification of each contract when the forecasted hedged transaction takes place or when the forecasted hedged transaction is probable of not occurring. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings in the current period. All risk components were taken into account to determine the hedge effectiveness of the cash flow hedges.
We enter into forward power contracts to manage commodity price risk exposure related to our generation of electricity. We do not hedge all commodity price risk. We reclassify gains and losses on forward power contracts from AOCI into earnings in those periods in which the contracts settle.
We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to anticipated borrowings of fixed-rate debt. We do not hedge all interest rate exposure. As of September 30, 2011, we have outstanding interest rate hedging relationships with aggregate notional amounts of $160 million related to planned future borrowing activities in calendar year 2013. During the three months ended September 30, 2011, interest rate hedging relationships with a notional amount of $200 million settled resulting in making a cash payment of $48.1 million ($31.3 million net of tax) during the period. As part of the Proposed Merger discussed in Note 16, entered into a $425.0 million unsecured term loan agreement with a syndicated bank group on August 24, 2011, in part, to pay the approximately $297.4 million principal amount of 6.875% debt that was due in September 2011. The remainder will be used for other corporate purposes. This agreement is for a three year term expiring on August 24, 2014. See Note 5 for further information. As a result, some of the forecasted transactions originally being hedged are probable of not occurring and therefore approximately $3.1 million ($2.0 million net of tax) of the fair value of the derivative instrument associated with those forecasted transactions has been reclassified out of AOCI and reflected in earnings during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and approximately $5.1 million ($3.3 million net of tax) has been reclassified during the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The remaining forecasted transactions associated with our 2013 anticipated fixed-rate debt offerings have a high probability of occurrence as the proceeds will be used to fund existing debt maturities and projected capital expenditures. We reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to our debt financings from AOCI into earnings in those periods in which hedged interest payments occur.

Mark-to-Market Accounting
Certain derivative contracts are entered into on a regular basis as part of our risk management program but do not qualify for hedge accounting or the normal purchase and sales exceptions under FASC Topic 815. Accordingly, such contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in the fair value charged or credited to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Results of Operations in the period in which the change occurred. This is commonly referred to as "MTM accounting." Contracts we enter into as part of our risk management program may be settled financially, by physical delivery or net settled with the counterparty. We currently mark-to-market Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs), heating oil futures, forward NYMEX-quality coal contracts and certain forward power contracts.
Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts, as provided under GAAP. Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under GAAP are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Results of Operations on an accrual basis.
 
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
In accordance with regulatory accounting under GAAP, a cost that is probable of recovery in future rates should be deferred as a regulatory asset and a revenue that is probable of being returned to customers should be deferred as a regulatory liability. Portions of the derivative contracts that are marked to market each reporting period and are related to the retail portion of load requirements are included as part of the fuel and purchased power recovery rider approved by the PUCO which began January 1, 2010. Therefore, the Ohio retail customers' portion of the heating oil futures and the NYMEX-quality coal contracts are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts settle. If these unrealized gains and losses are no longer deemed to be probable of recovery through our rates, they will be reclassified into earnings in the period such determination is made.

Certain of our OTC commodity derivative contracts are under master netting agreements that contain provisions that require our debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, we would be in violation of these provisions, and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization of the MTM loss. The changes in our credit ratings in April 2011 have not triggered the provisions discussed above; however, there is a possibility of further downgrades related to the Proposed Merger with AES that could trigger such provisions. See Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments that are in a MTM loss position at September 30, 2011 is $13.1 million. This amount is offset by $6.9 million of collateral posted directly with third parties and in a broker margin account which offsets our loss positions on the forward power contracts. This liability position is further offset by the asset position of counterparties with master netting agreements of $2.1 million.

DPL Inc.  Guarantees
In the normal course of business, enters into various agreements with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, DPLE and DPLER and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, MC Squared, providing financial or performance assurance to third parties. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to these subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish these subsidiaries' intended commercial purposes. Certain of financial or performance assurance agreements contain provisions that require our debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, we would be in violation of the provisions, and the counterparties to the assurance agreements could demand alternative credit assurance or, in some instances, early termination. The changes in our credit ratings in April 2011 have not triggered these provisions. and credit ratings may have additional downgrades as a result of the Proposed Merger discussed in Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This may cause the need for additional credit assurance to satisfy various creditors.

Environmental Matters Related to Air Quality
Clean Air Act Compliance
In 1990, the federal government amended the CAA to further regulate air pollution. Under the law, the USEPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States. The CAA allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. The CAA has a material effect on our operations and such effects are detailed below with respect to certain programs under the CAA.
On October 27, 2003, the USEPA published final rules regarding the equipment replacement provision (ERP) of the routine maintenance, repair and replacement (RMRR) exclusion of the CAA. Activities at power plants that fall within the scope of the RMRR exclusion do not trigger new source review (NSR) requirements, including the imposition of stricter emission limits. On December 24, 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stayed the effective date of the rule pending its decision on the merits of the lawsuits filed by numerous states and environmental organizations challenging the final rules. On June 6, 2005, the USEPA issued its final response on the reconsideration of the ERP exclusion. The USEPA clarified its position, but did not change any aspect of the 2003 final rules. This decision was appealed and the D.C. Circuit vacated the final rules on March 17, 2006. The scope of the RMRR exclusion remains uncertain due to this action by the D.C. Circuit, as well as multiple litigations not directly involving us where courts are defining the scope of the exception with respect to the specific facts and circumstances of the particular power plants and activities before the courts. While we believe that we have not engaged in any activities with respect to our existing power plants that would trigger the NSR requirements, if NSR requirements were imposed on any of existing power plants, the results could have a material adverse impact on us.
DP&L's
The USEPA issued a proposed rule on October 20, 2005, concerning the test for measuring whether modifications to electric generating units should trigger application of NSR standards under the CAA. A supplemental rule was also proposed on May 8, 2007, to include additional options for determining if there is an emissions increase when an existing electric generating unit makes a physical or operational change. The rule was challenged by environmental organizations and has not been finalized. While we cannot predict the outcome of this rulemaking, any finalized rules could materially affect our operations.
Interstate Air Quality Rule
On December 17, 2003, the USEPA proposed the Interstate Air Quality Rule (IAQR) designed to reduce and permanently cap SO
2
and NOx emissions from electric utilities. The proposed IAQR focused on states, including Ohio, whose power plant emissions are believed to be significantly contributing to fine particle and ozone pollution in other downwind states in the eastern United States. On June 10, 2004, the USEPA issued a supplemental proposal to the IAQR, then renamed the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The final rules were signed on March 10, 2005, and were published on May 12, 2005. CAIR created an interstate trading program for annual NOx emission allowances and made modifications to an existing trading program for SO
2
. On August 24, 2005, the USEPA proposed additional revisions to the CAIR. On July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision to vacate the USEPA's CAIR and its associated Federal Implementation Plan and remanded to the USEPA with instructions to issue new regulations that conformed with the procedural and substantive requirements of the CAA. The Court's decision, in part, invalidated the new NOx annual emission allowance trading program and the modifications to the SO
2
emission trading program established by the March 10, 2005 rules, and created uncertainty regarding future NOx and SO
2
emission reduction requirements and their timing. The USEPA and a group representing utilities filed a request on September 24, 2008, for a rehearing before the entire Court. On December 23, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued an order on reconsideration that permits CAIR to remain in effect until the USEPA issues new regulations that would conform to the CAA requirements and the Court's July 11, 2008 decision.
On July 6, 2010, the USEPA proposed the Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) to replace CAIR. We reviewed this proposal and submitted comments to the USEPA on September 30, 2010. These rules were finalized as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) on July 6, 2011. CSAPR responds to the court ruling remanding the 2005 CAIR. CSAPR creates four separate trading programs: two SO
2
areas (Group 1 and Group 2), and two NOx reduction requirements (annual and ozone season). Group 1 states (16 states including Ohio) will have to meet a 2012 cap and additional reductions in 2014. Group 2 states (7 states) will only have to meet the 2012 cap. The rule is effective January 1, 2012, and allowances
 
were distributed in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are in the process of reviewing the rule and are currently unable to predict the ultimate financial effect. We do not believe the rule will have a material impact on our operations in 2012.
In 2007, the Ohio EPA revised their State Implementation Plan (SIP) to incorporate a CAIR program consistent with the IAQR. The Ohio EPA had received partial approval from the USEPA and had been awaiting full program approval from the USEPA when the U.S. Court of Appeals issued its July 11, 2008 decision. As a result of the December 23, 2008 order, the Ohio EPA proposed revised rules on May 11, 2009, which were finalized on July 15, 2009. On September 25, 2009, the USEPA issued a full SIP approval for the Ohio CAIR program. CSAPR, finalized on July 6, 2011, institutes a federal implementation plan (FIP) in lieu of state SIPs for 2012 and allows for the states to develop SIPs for approval as early as 2013. We do not expect the FIP will have a significant impact on operations.
Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants
On January 30, 2004, the USEPA published its proposal to restrict mercury and other air toxins from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants. The USEPA "de-listed" mercury as a hazardous air pollutant from coal-fired and oil-fired utility plants and, instead, proposed a cap-and-trade approach to regulate the total amount of mercury emissions allowed from such sources. The final Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) was signed March 15, 2005, and was published on May 18, 2005. On March 29, 2005, nine states sued the USEPA, opposing the cap-and-trade regulatory approach taken by the USEPA. In 2007, the Ohio EPA adopted rules implementing the CAMR program. On February 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the USEPA regulations, finding that the USEPA had not complied with statutory requirements applicable to "de-listing" a hazardous air pollutant and that a cap-and-trade approach was not authorized by law for "listed" hazardous air pollutants. A request for rehearing before the entire Court of Appeals was denied and a petition for review before the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on October 17, 2008. On February 23, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition. On May 3, 2011, the USEPA published proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for coal- and oil-fired electric generating units and is expected to finalize this rule during the quarter ending December 31, 2011. Upon publication in the Federal Register following finalization, affected electric generating units (EGUs) will have three years to come into compliance with the new requirements. is unable to determine the impact on its financial condition or results of operations or the costs that may be incurred to comply with any new requirement; however, a MACT standard could have a material adverse effect on our operations and result in material compliance costs.

On April 29, 2010, the USEPA issued a proposed rule that would reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants from new and existing industrial, commercial and institutional boilers, and process heaters at major and area source facilities. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on March 21, 2011. This regulation affects seven auxiliary boilers used for start-up purposes at generation facilities. The regulations contain emissions limitations, operating limitations and other requirements. The compliance date was originally March 21, 2014. However, the USEPA has announced that the compliance date for existing boilers will be delayed until a judicial review is no longer pending or until the EPA completes its reconsideration of the rule. Compliance costs are not expected to be material to operations.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards
On January 5, 2005, the USEPA published its final non-attainment designations for the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for Fine Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5). These designations included counties and partial counties in which operates and/or owns generating facilities. On March 4, 2005, and other Ohio electric utilities and electric generators filed a petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the final rule creating these designations. On November 30, 2005, the court ordered the USEPA to decide on all petitions for reconsideration by January 20, 2006. On January 20, 2006, the USEPA denied the petitions for reconsideration. On July 7, 2009, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the USEPA non-attainment designations for the areas impacting

On May 5, 2004, the USEPA issued its proposed regional haze rule, which addresses how states should determine the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for sources covered under the regional haze rule. Final rules were published July 6, 2005, providing states with several options for determining whether sources in the state should be subject to BART. In the final rule, the USEPA made the determination that CAIR achieves greater progress than BART and may be used by states as a BART substitute. Numerous units owned and operated by us will be impacted by BART. We cannot determine the extent of the impact until Ohio determines how BART will be implemented.

Carbon Emissions and Other Greenhouse Gases
In response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that the USEPA has the authority to regulate CO
2
emissions from motor vehicles, the USEPA made a finding that CO
2
and certain other GHGs are pollutants under the CAA. Subsequently, under the CAA, USEPA determined that CO
2
and other GHGs from motor vehicles threaten the health and welfare of future generations by contributing to climate change. This finding became effective in January 2010. Numerous affected parties have petitioned the USEPA Administrator to reconsider this decision. On April 1, 2010, USEPA signed the "Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards" rule. Under USEPA's view, this is the final action that renders carbon dioxide and other GHGs "regulated air pollutants" under the CAA.
The USEPA plans to propose GHG standards for new and modified electric generating units (EGUs) under CAA subsection 111(b)  and propose and promulgate guidelines for states to address GHG standards for existing EGUs under CAA subsection 111(d)  later in 2011, and such final standards by May 2012. These rules may focus on energy efficiency improvements at power plants. We cannot predict the effect of these standards, if any, on operations.

Litigation, Notices of Violation and Other Matters Related to Air Quality
Litigation Involving Co-Owned Plants
On June 20, 2011, the Supreme Court rejected federal common law nuisance claims brought initially in 2004 by eight states, the City of New York and three land trusts, who had sought injunctive relief and limitations on GHGs emitted by American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP), one of AEP's subsidiaries, Cinergy Corp. (a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation (Duke Energy)) and four other electric power companies. The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act and the authority given to EPA under that Act to regulate GHGs displaced any right that plaintiffs may have had to seek similar regulation through federal common law litigation in the court system. Although we are not named as a party to these lawsuits, is a co-owner of coal-fired plants with Duke Energy and AEP (or their subsidiaries) that could have been affected by the outcome of these lawsuits or similar suits that may have been filed against other electric power companies, including . Because the issue was not squarely before it, the Supreme Court did not rule against the portion of plaintiffs' original suits that sought relief under State law.

Environmental Matters Related to Water Quality, Waste Disposal and Ash Ponds
Clean Water Act  Regulation of Water Intake
On July 9, 2004, the USEPA issued final rules pursuant to the Clean Water Act governing existing facilities that have cooling water intake structures. The rules require an assessment of impingement and/or entrainment of organisms as a result of cooling water withdrawal. A number of parties appealed the rules to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York and the Court issued an opinion on January 25, 2007, remanding several aspects of the rule to the USEPA for reconsideration. Several parties petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review of the lower court decision. On April 14, 2008, the Supreme Court elected to review the lower court decision on the issue of whether the USEPA can compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. Briefs were submitted to the Court in the summer of 2008 and oral arguments were held in December 2008. In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the USEPA did have the authority to compare costs with benefits in determining best technology available. The USEPA released new proposed regulations on March 28, 2011, published in the Federal Register on April 20, 2011. We submitted comments to the proposed regulations on August 17, 2011.

Clean Water Act  Regulation of Water Discharge
On May 4, 2004, the Ohio EPA issued a final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit (the Permit) for J.M. Stuart Station that continued our authority to discharge water from the station into the Ohio River. During the three-year term of the Permit, we conducted a thermal discharge study to evaluate the technical feasibility and economic reasonableness of water cooling methods other than cooling towers. In December 2006, we submitted an application for the renewal of the Permit that was due to expire on June 30, 2007. In July 2007, we received a draft permit proposing to continue our authority to discharge water from the station into the Ohio River. On February 5, 2008, we received a letter from the Ohio EPA indicating that they intended to impose a compliance schedule as part of the final Permit, that requires us to implement one of two diffuser options for the discharge of water from the station into the Ohio River as identified in the thermal discharge study.

As a member of PJM, receives revenues from the RTO related to its transmission and generation assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. SB 221 included a provision that would allow Ohio electric utilities to seek and obtain a reconcilable rider to recover RTO-related costs and credits. TCRR and PJM RPM riders were initially approved in November 2009 to recover these costs. Both the TCRR and the RPM riders assign costs and revenues from PJM monthly bills to retail ratepayers based on the percentage of SSO retail customers' load and sales volumes to total retail load and total retail and wholesale volumes. Customer switching to CRES providers decreases SSO retail customers' load and sales volumes. Therefore, increases in customer switching cause more of the RPM capacity costs and revenues to be excluded from the RPM rider calculation. annual true-up of these two riders was approved by the PUCO by an order dated April 27, 2011.

There can be no assurance that the Proposed Merger will be consummated, that the parties will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement or that the District Court will approve the settlement even if the parties enter into such stipulation. In such event, the proposed settlement as contemplated by the MOU may be terminated. The settlement will not affect the amount of the merger consideration that shareholders are entitled to receive in the Proposed Merger. and its board of directors believe that these lawsuits are without merit and are seeking to settle them to eliminate the burden and expense of litigation and to provide additional information to shareholders at a time and in a manner that would not have caused any further delay in 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or cause any delay in the consummation of the Proposed Merger.

We operate and manage generation assets and are exposed to a number of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, electricity wholesale price risk, PJM capacity price risk, regulatory risk, environmental risk, fuel supply and price risk, customer switching risk and the risk associated with power plant performance. We attempt to manage these risks through various means. For instance, we operate a portfolio of wholly-owned and jointly-owned generation assets that is diversified as to coal source, cost structure and operating characteristics. We are focused on the operating efficiency of these power plants and maintaining their availability.
We operate and manage transmission and distribution assets in a rate-regulated environment. Accordingly, this subjects us to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that we may recover and the investment returns that we may collect in customer rates. We are focused on delivering electricity and maintaining high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost-effective manner.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Merger Agreement with The AES Corporation
On April 19, 2011, and The AES Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("AES"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") whereby AES will acquire for $30.00 per share in a cash transaction valued at approximately $3.5 billion plus the assumption of $1.2 billion of debt. Upon closing, will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of AES.

The transaction has been unanimously approved by each of and AES' board of directors and was approved by shareholders on September 23, 2011. Consummation of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of all required regulatory approvals from, among others, the FERC and the PUCO. On May 18, 2011, DPL and AES filed merger applications with the FERC and the PUCO. The FERC application will be deemed approved after 180 days, unless the FERC tolls for good cause the completed application for further consideration, which may or may not occur as part of the FERC's review. On October 26, 2011, DP&L reached a Stipulation and Recommendation with the PUCO staff and other parties in the AES/DP&L joint application for approval of the Proposed Merger. The Stipulation and Recommendation was filed with the PUCO on October 26, 2011, and is pending PUCO approval.

Also on May 18, 2011, DPL and AES each filed their respective Premerger Notification and Report Forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Those filings initiated a statutory 30-day waiting period, which expired on June 14, 2011, when early termination of the waiting period was granted. The Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration also issued a formal approval with respect to the Proposed Merger on May 18, 2011. The parties anticipate receiving additional approvals and then closing the transaction during the fourth quarter of 2011 or first quarter of 2012.
See Item 1a, "Risk Factors," and Note 16 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional risks and information related to the Proposed Merger.
 
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and restrictions, limitations and prohibitions as to actions we may or may not take in the period prior to consummation of the Proposed Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. Among other restrictions, without the consent of AES, the Merger Agreement limits our total capital expenditures, limits the extent to which we can obtain financing through long-term debt and equity, and we may not, without the prior consent of AES, increase our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.3325 per share.
Dolphin Subsidiary II, Inc., a subsidiary of AES, issued $1.25 billion in long-term Senior Notes on October 3, 2011, to partially finance the Proposed Merger.

Purchase of a Retail Electricity Supplier
On February 28, 2011, DPLER purchased MC Squared, a Chicago-based retail electricity supplier, for approximately $8.2 million. MC Squared serves approximately 3,000 customers in Northern Illinois at September 30, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, it sold approximately 648 million kWh of power, generating revenues of approximately $46 million. We believe that the purchase of MC Squared complements DPLER's existing Ohio retail market activity and provides a platform for expansion into other attractive markets.

We have identified certain issues that we believe may have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the future. The following issues mentioned below are not meant to be exhaustive but to provide insight on matters that are likely to have an effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future:
 
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 
There is an on-going concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the contribution of emissions of GHGs, including most significantly, CO
2
. This concern has led to interest in legislation at the federal level, actions at the state level as well as litigation relating to GHG emissions. In 2007, a U.S. Supreme Court decision upheld that the USEPA has the authority to regulate CO
2
emissions from motor vehicles under the CAA. In April 2009, the USEPA issued a proposed endangerment finding under the CAA, which was finalized and published on December 15, 2009. The proposed finding determined that CO
2
and other GHGs from motor vehicles threaten the health and welfare of future generations by contributing to climate change. In December 2009, the USEPA finalized this endangerment finding with a regulatory effective date of January 2010. Numerous affected parties have asked the USEPA Administrator to reconsider this decision. This endangerment finding, if not changed, is expected to lead to the regulation of CO
2
and other GHGs from electric generating units and other stationary sources of these emissions. Increased pressure for CO
2
emissions reduction is also coming from investor organizations and the international community. Environmental advocacy groups are also focusing considerable attention on CO
2
emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. Legislation proposed in 2009 to target a reduction in the emission of GHGs from large sources was not enacted. Approximately 99% of the energy we produce is generated by coal. share of CO
DP&L's
2
emissions at generating stations we own and co-own is approximately 16 million tons annually. If legislation or regulations are passed at the federal or state levels that impose mandatory reductions of CO
2
and other GHGs on generation facilities, the cost to and of such reductions could be material.
DPL
DP&L
 
SB 221 and the implementation rules contain targets relating to advanced energy portfolio standards, renewable energy, demand reduction and energy efficiency standards. The standards require that, by the year 2025, 25% of the total number of kWh of electricity sold by the utility to retail electric consumers must come from alternative energy resources, which include "advanced energy resources" such as distributed generation, clean coal, advanced nuclear, energy efficiency and fuel cell technology; and "renewable energy resources" such as solar, hydro, wind, geothermal and biomass. At least half of the 25% must be generated from renewable energy resources, including 0.5% from solar energy. The renewable energy portfolio, energy efficiency and demand reduction standards began in 2009 with increased percentage requirements each year thereafter. The annual targets for energy efficiency and peak demand reductions also began in 2009 with annual increases. Energy efficiency programs are to save 22.3% by 2025 and peak demand reductions are expected to reach 7.75% by 2018 compared to a baseline energy usage. If any targets are not met, compliance penalties will apply, unless the PUCO makes certain findings that would excuse performance.
SB 221 also contains provisions for determining whether an electric utility has significantly excessive earnings. The PUCO issued general rules for calculating the earnings and comparing them to a comparable group to determine whether there were significantly excessive earnings. Pursuant to the ESP Stipulation, becomes subject to the SEET in 2013 based on 2012 earnings results and the SEET may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
DP&L
faces regulatory uncertainty from its next ESP or MRO filing which is scheduled to be filed in the first quarter of 2012 to be effective January 1, 2013. The filing may result in changes to the current rate structure and riders. We are monitoring other utilities in Ohio and their ESP and MRO filings.

The USEPA issued CAIR on March 10, 2005 to regulate certain upwind states with respect to fine particulate matter and ozone. CAIR created interstate trading programs for annual NOx emission allowances and made modifications to an existing trading program for SO
2
that were to take effect in 2010. On July 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision that vacated the USEPA CAIR and its associated Federal Implementation Plan. This decision remanded these issues back to the USEPA. The court's decision, in part, invalidated the new NOx annual emission allowance trading program and the modifications to the SO
2
emission trading program, and created uncertainty regarding future NOx and SO
2
emission reduction
 
requirements and their timing. On December 23, 2008, the court reversed part of its decision that vacated CAIR. Thus, CAIR currently remains in effect, but the USEPA remains subject to the court's order to revise the program. On July 6, 2010, the USEPA proposed the Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) to replace CAIR. We reviewed this proposal and submitted comments to the USEPA on September 30, 2010. These rules were finalized as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) on July 6, 2011. CSAPR responds to the court ruling remanding the 2005 CAIR. CSAPR creates four separate trading programs: two SO
2
areas (Group 1 and Group 2), and two NOx reduction requirements (annual and ozone season). Group 1 states (16 states including Ohio) will have to meet a 2012 cap and additional reductions in 2014. Group 2 states (7 states) will only have to meet the 2012 cap. The rule is effective January 1, 2012, and allowances were distributed in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are in the process of reviewing the rule and are currently unable to predict the ultimate financial effect. We do not believe the rule will have a material impact on our operations in 2012.
COMPETITION AND PJM PRICING
 
The PJM RPM capacity base residual auction for the 2014/2015 period cleared at a per megawatt price of $126/day for our RTO area. The per megawatt prices for the periods 2013/2014, 2012/2013, 2011/2012 and 2010/2011 were $28/day, $16/day, $110/day and $174/day, respectively, based on previous auctions. Future RPM auction results will be dependent not only on the overall supply and demand of generation and load, but may also be impacted by congestion as well as PJM's business rules relating to bidding for demand response and energy efficiency resources in the RPM capacity auctions. The SSO retail costs and revenues are included in the RPM rider. Therefore increases in customer switching causes more of the RPM capacity costs and revenues to be excluded from the RPM rider calculation. We cannot predict the outcome of future auctions or customer switching but based on actual results attained in 2010, we estimate that a hypothetical increase or decrease of $10/day in the capacity auction price would result in an annual impact to net income of approximately $5.2 million and $3.8 million for and , respectively. These estimates do not, however, take into consideration the other factors that may affect the impact of capacity revenues and costs on net income such as the levels of customer switching, our generation capacity, the levels of wholesale revenues and our retail customer load. These estimates are discussed further within Commodity Pricing Risk under the Market Risk section of this Management Discussion & Analysis.

Lower overall power market prices have resulted in increased levels of competition to provide transmission and generation services. This in turn has led to a significant number of customers to switch their retail electric services to CRES providers. DPLER, an affiliated company and one of the registered CRES providers, has been marketing transmission and generation services to customers. The following table provides a summary of the number of electric customers and volumes provided by all CRES providers in our service territory during the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:

The volumes supplied by DPLER represent approximately 40% and 34% of total distribution volumes during the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The reduction to gross margin during the three months ended September 30, 2011 as a result of customers switching to DPLER and other CRES providers was approximately $19.8 million and $28.8 million, for and , respectively. We currently cannot determine the extent to which customer switching to CRES providers will occur in the future and the impact this will have on our operations, but any additional switching could have a significant adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

During the second and third quarters of 2011, we have seen a significant increase in retail competition for our residential retail customers. Approximately 12% of annualized residential load switched to CRES providers during those quarters with DPLER acquiring 57% of the switched load. For the calendar year 2011, based on current trends, we project customer switching will negatively impact gross margin by approximately $55 - $60 million compared to the 2010 impact of approximately $17.0 million.

FUEL AND RELATED COSTS
 
The coal market is a global market in which domestic prices are affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance. In addition, domestic issues like government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues are affecting mining costs and supply availability. Our approach is to hedge the fuel costs for our anticipated electric sales. For the year ending December 31, 2011, we have hedged substantially all our coal requirements to meet our committed sales. We may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from commodity price volatility. If our suppliers do not meet their contractual commitments or we are not hedged against price volatility and we are unable to recover costs through the fuel and purchased power recovery rider, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially affected.
Effective January 2010, the SSO retail customers' portion of fuel price changes, including coal requirements and purchased power costs, was reflected in the implementation of the fuel and purchased power recovery rider, subject to PUCO review. recently underwent an audit of its fuel and purchased power recovery rider, but there is some uncertainty as to the costs that will be recovered from or returned to customers. On October 6, 2011, and all of the active participants in this proceeding reached a Stipulation and Recommendation that resolves the majority of the issues raised by the auditor. On October 19, 2011, we had a hearing on this case. Although the Stipulation and Recommendation was uncontested, the PUCO may approve, disapprove, or modify the stipulation. expects to record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment to earnings after the final order is received.

Income Statement Highlights  DPL
 
 
 
DPL  Revenues
Retail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, our retail sales volume is impacted by the number of heating and cooling degree days occurring during a year. Cooling degree days typically have a more significant impact than heating degree days since some residential customers do not use electricity to heat their homes.
 
 
Since we plan to utilize our internal generating capacity to supply our retail customers' needs first, increases in retail demand may decrease the volume of internal generation available to be sold in the wholesale market and vice versa. The wholesale market covers a multi-state area and settles on an hourly basis throughout the year. Factors impacting our wholesale sales volume each hour of the year include: wholesale market prices; our retail demand; retail demand elsewhere throughout the entire wholesale market area; our plants' and other utility plants' availability to sell into the wholesale market and weather conditions across the multi-state region. Our plan is to make wholesale sales when market prices allow for the economic operation of our generation facilities not being utilized to meet our retail demand or when margin opportunities exist between the wholesale sales and power purchase prices.
The following table provides a summary of changes in revenues from the prior period:
 
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, Revenues decreased $5.1 million to $511.8 million from $516.9 million in the same period of the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of lower retail sales volumes and a decrease in RTO capacity and other RTO revenues, partially offset by higher retail and wholesale average rates and higher wholesale sales volume.
 
 
 
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Revenues increased $37.8 million to $1,451.4 million from $1,413.6 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of higher retail and wholesale average rates and an increase in RTO capacity and other RTO revenues, partially offset by lower retail and wholesale sales volumes.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.7 million, or 1%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increase is primarily the result of a net increase in depreciable property partially offset by a decrease due to a depreciation study which resulted in lower depreciation rates on generation property which were implemented on July 1, 2010.
DPL  General Taxes
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, General taxes increased $1.2 million, or 4% as compared to the same period in 2010. This increase was primarily the result of higher property tax accruals in 2011 compared to 2010.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, General taxes increased $7.8 million, or 8% as compared to the same period in 2010.

Utility Segment
The Utility segment is comprised of electric generation, transmission and distribution businesses which generate and sell electricity to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. Electricity for the segment's 24 county service area is primarily generated at eight coal-fired power plants and is distributed to more than 500,000 retail customers who are located in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio. also sells electricity to DPLER in Ohio and any excess energy and capacity is sold into the wholesale market. transmission and distribution businesses are subject to rate regulation by federal and state regulators while rates for its generation business are deemed competitive under Ohio law.

Competitive Retail Segment
The Competitive Retail segment is comprised of DPLER's competitive retail electric service business which sells retail electric energy under contract to residential, commercial and industrial customers who have selected DPLER as their alternative electric supplier. The Competitive Retail segment sells electricity to approximately 25,000 customers located throughout Ohio and Illinois. Beginning February 28, 2011, the Competitive Retail segment includes the results of MC Squared, a Chicago-based retail electricity supplier. MC Squared was purchased by DPLER on February 28, 2011 and serves approximately 3,000 customers in Northern Illinois. The Competitive Retail segment's electric energy used to meet its Ohio sales obligations was purchased from at market prices for wholesale power. The electric energy used to meet its Illinois sales obligation was purchased from PJM. The Competitive Retail segment has no transmission or generation assets. The operations of DPLER are not subject to rate regulation by federal or state regulators.

Competitive Retail Segment  Revenue
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, the segment's retail revenues increased $35.4 million, or 42%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by the high levels of competition in the competitive retail electric service business in the state of Ohio which has continued to result in a significant number of retail customers switching their retail electric service to DPLER. Also contributing to this increase was the purchase of MC Squared on February 28, 2011, resulting in additional retail revenues of $13.8 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2011. Primarily as a result of the purchase of MC Squared and customer switching in Ohio, the Competitive Retail segment sold approximately 1,871 million kWh of power to 25,309 customers during the three months ended September 30, 2011 compared to 1,384 million kWh sold to 4,826 customers during the same period in 2010.
DP&L's
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the segment's retail revenues increased $131.0 million, or 70%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily driven by the high levels of competition in the competitive retail electric service business in the state of Ohio which has continued to result in a significant number of retail customers switching their retail electric service to DPLER. Also contributing to this increase was the purchase of MC Squared on February 28, 2011, resulting in additional retail revenues of $30.1 million recorded since this purchase date. Primarily as a result of the purchase of MC Squared and customer switching in Ohio, the Competitive Retail segment sold approximately 5,011 million kWh of power to 25,309 customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to 3,166 million kWh sold to 4,826 customers during the same period in 2010.
DP&L's
Competitive Retail Segment  Purchased Power
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, Purchased power for the segment increased $25.5 million, or 34%, as compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to higher purchased power volumes required to satisfy an increasing customer base as a result of customer switching and the purchase of MC Squared. This increase was partially offset by lower average prices paid for purchased power in the three months ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The Competitive Retail segment's electric energy used to meet its Ohio sales obligations was purchased from at market prices for wholesale power. The electric energy used to meet the segment's Illinois sales obligation was purchased from PJM.
DP&L
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Purchased power for the segment increased $102.7 million, or 62%, as compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to higher purchased power volumes required to satisfy an increasing customer base as a result of customer switching and the purchase of MC Squared. Also contributing to this increase is higher average prices paid for purchased power for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The Competitive Retail segment's electric energy used to meet its Ohio sales obligations was purchased from at market prices for wholesale power. The electric energy used to meet the segment's Illinois sales obligation was purchased from PJM.

Competitive Retail Segment  Operation and Maintenance
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, the segment's Operation and maintenance expenses which include employee-related expenses, accounting, information technology, payroll, legal and other administration expenses, increased $2.5 million, or 125%, compared to the same period in 2010. The higher operation and maintenance expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 is primarily reflective of increased marketing and customer maintenance costs associated with the increased sales volume and number of customers.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the segment's Operation and maintenance expenses which include employee-related expenses, accounting, information technology, payroll, legal and other administration expenses, increased $5.8 million, or 121%, compared to the same period in 2010. The higher operation and maintenance expense in 2011 as compared to 2010 is primarily reflective of increased marketing and customer maintenance costs associated with the increased sales volume and number of customers.
Competitive Retail Segment  Income Tax Expense
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, the segment's income tax expense increased $2.8 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the segment's income tax expense increased $8.4 million compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to increased pre-tax income. In addition, as a result of the purchase of MC Squared we recorded a $2.0 million charge for state deferred taxes due to the Illinois Unitary Tax rules.

DP&L  Revenues
Retail customers, especially residential and commercial customers, consume more electricity on warmer and colder days. Therefore, retail sales volume is impacted by the number of heating and cooling degree days occurring during a year. Since plans to utilize its internal generating capacity to supply its retail customers' needs first, increases in retail demand will decrease the volume of internal generation available to be sold in the wholesale market and vice versa.
DP&L's
DP&L
The wholesale market covers a multi-state area and settles on an hourly basis throughout the year. Factors impacting wholesale sales volume each hour of the year include: wholesale market prices, retail demand, retail demand elsewhere throughout the entire wholesale market area, and non- plants' availability to sell into the wholesale market and weather conditions across the multi-state region. plan is to make wholesale sales when market prices allow for the economic operation of its generation facilities that are not being utilized to meet its retail demand.

The following table provides a summary of changes in revenues from the prior periods:
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, Revenues decreased $20.2 million, or 4%, to $466.8 million from $487.0 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of lower average retail rates and lower retail sales volumes and decreased RTO capacity and other revenues, partially offset by wholesale sales volumes, higher average wholesale prices and increased other miscellaneous revenues. The revenue components for the three months ended September 30, 2011 are further discussed below:
 
 
 
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Revenues decreased $9.7 million, or 1%, to $1,339.2 million from $1,348.9 million in the prior year.

Operation and Maintenance
 
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, Operation and maintenance expense increased $1.5 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2010. This variance was primarily the result of increased assistance for low-income retail customers which is funded by the USF revenue rate rider. These increases were partially offset by lower health insurance and disability costs primarily due to fewer employees filing for long-term disability during the current quarter as compared to the same period in 2010, lower expenses related to energy efficiency programs and lower expenses for generating facilities.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Operation and maintenance expense increased $23.3 million, or 10%, compared to the same period in 2010. This variance was primarily the result of:

DP&L  Depreciation and Amortization
For the three months ended September 30, 2011, Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million, or 11%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2010. The increase is primarily the result of a net increase in depreciable property.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.9 million, or 2%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increase is primarily the result of a net increase in depreciable property partially offset by a decrease due to a depreciation study which resulted in lower depreciation rates on generation property which were implemented on July 1, 2010.
DP&L  General Taxes
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, General taxes increased $1.0 million, or 3%, and $3.6 million, or 4%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2010. These increases were primarily the result of higher property tax accruals in 2011 compared to 2010.

Liquidity
We expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. Our business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, potential margin requirements for retail operations, interest and dividend payments. For 2011, and in subsequent years, we expect to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations and funds from the capital markets as our internal liquidity needs and market conditions warrant. We also expect that the borrowing capacity under credit facilities will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements during those periods.

Debt Covenants
As mentioned above has access to $125 million of short-term financing under its revolving credit facility and $425 million of financing under its term loan facility. Each of these facilities has two financial covenants. The first financial covenant requires total debt to total capitalization ratio to not exceed 0.65 to 1.00 prior to the consummation of the Proposed Merger and 0.70 to 1.00 after the consummation of the Proposed Merger. The second financial covenant, applicable only if credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, requires consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges ratio to be not less than 2.50 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2011 the first covenant was met with a ratio of 0.52 to 1.00 and the second covenant, while not currently applicable, would have been met with a ratio of 8.23 to 1.00. The debt to capitalization ratio is calculated as the sum of current and long-term portion of debt, including its guaranty obligations, divided by the total of shareholders' equity and total debt including guaranty obligations. The consolidated interest rate coverage ratio is calculated, at the end of each fiscal quarter, by dividing consolidated EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters by the consolidated interest charges for the same period.

Capital Requirements
Planned construction additions for 2011 relate primarily to new investments in and upgrades to power plant equipment and transmission and distribution system.

Approximately $15 million of this projected amount is to enable to meet the recently revised reliability standards of NERC. is subject to the mandatory reliability standards of NERC, and Reliability First Corporation (RFC), one of the eight NERC regions, of which is a member. NERC has recently changed the definition of the Bulk Electric System (BES) to include 100 kV and above facilities, thus expanding the facilities to which the reliability standards apply. Additionally, anticipates spending approximately $130 million within the next five years as part of its identified obligations under the PJM RTEP (Regional Transmission Expansion Plan) within its zone, as well as a cost-allocation of approximately $160 million for RTEP projects in other PJM zones. The latter is subject to change pending the revised PJM cost-allocation methodology, as a result of the Court of Appeals decision to remand the case to the FERC. Our ability to complete capital projects and the reliability of future service will be affected by our financial condition, the availability of internal funds and the reasonable cost of external funds.

DPL
 
enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to these subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish these subsidiaries' intended commercial purposes. Certain of financial or performance assurance agreements contain provisions that require our debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, we would be in violation of the provisions, and the counterparties to the assurance agreements could demand alternative credit assurance. The changes in our credit ratings in April 2011 have not triggered these provisions. However, there may be further changes to our credit ratings which may trigger these provisions.

See Note 14 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are subject to certain market risks including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices for electricity, coal, environmental emissions and gas, changes in capacity prices and fluctuations in interest rates. We use various market risk sensitive instruments, including derivative contracts, primarily to limit our exposure to fluctuations in commodity pricing. Our Commodity Risk Management Committee (CRMC), comprised of members of senior management, is responsible for establishing risk management policies and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures relating to our -operated generation units. The CRMC meets on a regular basis with the objective of identifying, assessing and quantifying material risk issues and developing strategies to manage these risks.
DP&L
Commodity Pricing Risk
Commodity pricing risk exposure includes the impacts of weather, market demand, increased competition and other economic conditions. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures at our -operated generation units, we use a variety of non-derivative and derivative instruments including forward contracts and futures contracts. These instruments are used principally for economic hedging purposes and none are held for trading purposes. Derivatives that fall within the scope of derivative accounting under GAAP must be recorded at their fair value and marked to market unless they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. MTM gains and losses on derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting are deferred in AOCI until the forecasted transactions occur. We adjust the derivative instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedging to fair value on a monthly basis and where applicable, we recognize a corresponding Regulatory asset for above-market costs or a Regulatory liability for below-market costs in accordance with regulatory accounting under GAAP.
DP&L
The coal market has increasingly been influenced by both international and domestic supply and consumption, making the price of coal more volatile than in the past, and while we have substantially all
 
of the total expected coal volume needed to meet our retail and firm wholesale sales requirements for 2011 under contract and a significant portion of projected 2012 needs, sales requirements may change, particularly for retail load. The majority of the contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices. Some contracts provide for periodic adjustments and some are priced based on market indices. Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, the wholesale market price of power, certain provisions in coal contracts related to government imposed costs, counterparty performance and credit, scheduled outages and generation plant mix. To the extent we are not able to hedge against price volatility or recover increases through our fuel and purchased power recovery rider that began in January 2010; our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially affected.
For purposes of potential risk analysis, we use a sensitivity analysis to quantify potential impacts of market rate changes on the statements of results of operations. The sensitivity analysis represents hypothetical changes in market values that may or may not occur in the future.
Commodity Derivatives
To minimize the risk of fluctuations in the market price of commodities, such as coal, power and heating oil, we may enter into commodity-forward and futures contracts to effectively hedge the cost/revenues of the commodity. Maturity dates of the contracts are scheduled to coincide with market purchases/sales of the commodity. Cash proceeds or payments between us and the counter-party at maturity of the contracts are recognized as an adjustment to the cost of the commodity purchased or sold. We generally do not enter into forward contracts beyond thirty-six months.
A 10% increase or decrease in the market price of our heating oil forwards and forward power contracts at September 30, 2011 would not have a significant effect on Net income.

Approximately 15% of and 33% of electric revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2011 were from sales of excess energy and capacity in the wholesale market ( electric revenues in the wholesale market are reduced for sales to DPLER). Energy in excess of the needs of existing retail customers is sold in the wholesale market when we can identify opportunities with positive margins.

RPM Capacity Revenues and Costs
As a member of PJM, receives revenues from the RTO related to its transmission and generation assets and incurs costs associated with its load obligations for retail customers. PJM, which has a delivery year which runs from June 1 to May 31, has conducted auctions for capacity through the 2014/15 delivery year. The clearing prices for capacity during the PJM delivery periods from 2010/11 through 2014/15 are as follows:
DP&L
 
Our computed average capacity prices by calendar year are reflected in the table below:
 
Future RPM auction results are dependent on a number of factors, which include the overall supply and demand of generation and load, other state legislation or regulation, transmission congestion, and PJM's RPM business rules. The volatility in the RPM capacity auction pricing has had and will continue to have a significant impact on capacity revenues and costs. Although currently has an approved RPM rider in place to recover or repay any excess capacity costs or revenues, the RPM rider only applies to customers supplied under our SSO. Customer switching reduces the number of customers supplied under our SSO, causing more of the RPM capacity costs and revenues to be excluded from the RPM rider calculation.

DP&L
The table below provides estimates of the effect on annual net income as of September 30, 2011, of a hypothetical increase or decrease of $10/MW-day in the RPM auction price. The table shows the impact resulting from capacity revenue changes. We did not include the impact of a change in the RPM capacity costs since these costs will either be recovered through the RPM rider for SSO retail customers or recovered through the development of our overall energy pricing for customers who do not fall under the SSO. These estimates include the impact of the RPM rider and are based on the levels of customer switching experienced through September 30, 2011. As of September 30, 2011, approximately 50% of RPM capacity revenues and costs were recoverable from SSO retail customers through the RPM rider.

Capacity revenues and costs are also impacted by, among other factors, the levels of customer switching, our generation capacity, the levels of wholesale revenues and our retail customer load. In determining the capacity price sensitivity above, we did not consider the impact that may arise from the variability of these other factors.
Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
and fuel (including coal, gas, oil and emission allowances) and purchased power costs as a percentage of total operating costs for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2011 were 42% and 37%, respectively. We have substantially all of the total expected coal volume needed to meet our retail and firm wholesale sales requirements for 2011 under contract and a significant portion of projected 2012 needs are also under contract. The majority of our contracted coal is purchased at fixed prices although some contracts provide for periodic pricing adjustments. We may purchase SO

allowances for 2011; however, the exact consumption of SO
2
allowances will depend on market prices for power, availability of our generation units and the actual sulfur content of the coal burned. We may purchase some NOx allowances for 2011 depending on NOx emissions. Fuel costs are affected by changes in volume and price and are driven by a number of variables including weather, reliability of coal deliveries, scheduled outages and generation plant mix.
Purchased power costs depend, in part, upon the timing and extent of planned and unplanned outages of our generating capacity. We will purchase power on a discretionary basis when wholesale market conditions provide opportunities to obtain power at a cost below our internal generation costs.
Effective January 1, 2010, was allowed to recover its SSO customers' share of fuel and purchased power costs as part of the fuel rider approved by the PUCO. Since there has been an increase in customer switching, SSO customers currently represent approximately 50% of total fuel costs. The table below provides the effect on annual net income as of September 30, 2011, of a hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the prices of fuel and purchased power, adjusted for the approximate 50%:

As a result of our normal investing and borrowing activities, our financial results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which we manage through our regular financing activities. We maintain both cash on deposit and investments in cash equivalents that may be affected by adverse interest rate fluctuations. has fixed-rate long-term debt and has both fixed and variable-rate long-term debt. variable-rate debt is associated with tax-exempt pollution control bonds. The variable-rate bonds bear interest based on a prevailing rate that is reset weekly based on a comparable market index. Market indexes can be affected by market demand, supply, market interest rates and other economic conditions. As a result of the Proposed Merger with AES, and were recently downgraded by one of the major credit rating agencies and all three major credit rating agencies reduced their outlook from stable to negative. We do not anticipate these reduced ratings having a significant impact on our liquidity; however, our cost of capital will increase.

We partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by entering into interest rate swap agreements to limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. As of September 30, 2011, we have entered into interest rate hedging relationships with an aggregate notional amount of $160 million related to planned future borrowing activities in calendar year 2013. The average interest rate associated with the $160 million aggregate notional amount interest rate hedging relationships is 4%. We are limiting our exposure to changes in interest rates since we believe the market interest rates at which we will be able to borrow in the future may increase.

Long-term Debt Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis
The following table presents our estimate of market risk exposure for our fixed-rate and variable-rate debt at September 30, 2011 for which an immediate adverse market movement causes a potential material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or the fair value of the debt. We believe that the adverse market movement represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. As of September 30, 2011, we did not hold any market risk sensitive instruments which were entered into for trading purposes.

debt is comprised of both fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt. In regard to fixed-rate debt, the interest rate risk with respect to long-term debt, excluding capital lease obligations, primarily relates to the potential impact a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates has on the fair value of $1,104.6 million of fixed-rate debt and not on financial position or results of operations. On the variable-rate debt, the interest rate risk with respect to long-term debt represents the potential impact an increase of one percentage point in the interest rate has on results of operations related to $100.0 million variable-rate long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2011.

Equity Price Risk
As of September 30, 2011, approximately 32% of the defined benefit pension plan assets were comprised of investments in equity securities and 68% related to investments in fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The equity securities are carried at their market value of approximately $106.1 million at September 30, 2011. A hypothetical 10% decrease in prices quoted by stock exchanges would result in a $10.6 million reduction in fair value as of September 30, 2011.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any investment contract, loan agreement or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk arises from all activities in which success depends on issuer, borrower or counterparty performance, whether reflected on or off the balance sheet. We limit our credit risk by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with
 
them and continue to evaluate their creditworthiness after transactions have been originated. We use the three leading corporate credit rating agencies and other current market-based qualitative and quantitative data to assess the financial strength of counterparties on an ongoing basis. We may require various forms of credit assurance from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk.
and condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of these financial statements, our management is required to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. These assumptions, estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience and assumptions that we believed to be reasonable at the time. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Our critical accounting estimates are those which require assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain.

Different estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or circumstances. Historically, however, recorded estimates have not differed materially from actual results. Significant items subject to such judgments include: the carrying value of property, plant and equipment; unbilled revenues; the valuation of derivative instruments; the valuation of insurance and claims liabilities; the valuation of allowances for receivables and deferred income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities; reserves recorded for income tax exposures; litigation; contingencies; the valuation of AROs; and assets and liabilities related to employee benefits.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures. These controls and procedures were designed to ensure that material information relating to us and our subsidiaries are communicated to the CEO and CFO. We evaluated these disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report with the participation of our CEO and CFO. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective: (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
 
 
Item 1Legal Proceedings
In the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under laws and regulations. We are also from time to time involved in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental and regulatory agencies regarding our business, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. We believe the amounts provided in our Financial Statements, as prescribed by GAAP, for these matters are adequate in light of the probable and estimable contingencies. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims and other matters (including those matters noted below) and to comply with applicable laws and regulations will not exceed the amounts reflected in our Financial Statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided for in our Financial Statements, cannot be reasonably determined.

Sales of any excess emission allowances are impacted by a range of factors, such as general economic conditions, fluctuations in market demand, availability of excess inventory available for sale and changes to the regulatory environment, including the enactment of the USEPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR"). These factors could cause the amount and price of excess emission allowances sells to fluctuate, which could cause a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for any particular period. There has been overall reduced trading activity in the annual NOx and SO

The adoption of regulations that regulate emissions or establish or modify emission allowance trading programs, like the CSAPR, which was finalized on July 6, 2011, could impact the emission allowance trading markets and have a material effect on emission allowance sales.

DPL may be unable to obtain the approvals required to complete its Proposed Merger with The AES Corporation or, obtaining required governmental and regulatory approvals may require the combined company to comply with restrictions or conditions that may materially impact the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Merger.
On April 20, 2011, announced the execution of a definitive merger agreement with The AES Corporation (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which each outstanding share of DPL common stock will be converted into the right to receive cash in the amount of $30.00 per share. The Proposed Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals from, among others, the FERC and the PUCOThese governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion, or require changes to the terms, of the Proposed Merger, including restrictions or conditions on the business, operations, or financial performance of the combined company following consummation that may materially impact the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Merger. These conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the Proposed Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Proposed Merger. A delay in the completion of the Proposed Merger beyond the termination date specified in the Merger Agreement due to, among other things, restrictions or conditions sought by governmental authorities could provide either party the right to terminate the Merger Agreement.

We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Proposed Merger with The AES Corporation is pending that could adversely affect our financial results.
Uncertainty about the effect of the Proposed Merger on employees or suppliers may have an adverse effect on us. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Proposed Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships.
Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the Proposed Merger, as current employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to accept employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, our business operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
We expect that matters relating to the Proposed Merger and integration-related issues will place a significant burden on management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities. The diversion of management time on merger-related issues could affect our financial results.
In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us, without The AES Corporation's consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions, including limiting our total capital spending, limiting the extent that we can obtain financing through long-term debt and equity and prohibiting our ability to increase the dividend rates on our stock until the Proposed Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to consummation of the Proposed Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.
Lawsuits have been filed and several other lawsuits may be filed against DPL, its directors, AES and Dolphin Sub, Inc. challenging the Merger Agreement, and an adverse judgment in such lawsuits may prevent the Proposed Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.
and its directors have been named and AES and Dolphin Sub, Inc. have also been named, as defendants in purported class action and derivative action lawsuits filed by certain of our shareholders challenging the Proposed Merger and seeking, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from consummating the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. We could also be subject to additional litigation related to the Proposed Merger, whether or not it is consummated. If any plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the Proposed Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the injunction may prevent the completion of the Proposed Merger in the expected timeframe or altogether. While we currently believe that any such litigation is without merit, these matters create additional uncertainty relating to the consummation of the proposed transaction and defending such matters is costly and distracting to management.
DPL
 
Push-down accounting adjustments in connection with the Proposed Merger may have a material effect on DPL's future financial results.
Under U.S. GAAP, pursuant to FASC No. 805 and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5.J "New Basis of Accounting Required in Certain Circumstances", when an acquisition results in an entity becoming substantially wholly owned, push-down accounting is applied in the acquired entity's separate financial statements. Push-down accounting requires that the fair value adjustments and goodwill or negative goodwill identified by the acquiring entity be pushed down and reflected in the financial statements of the acquired entity. As a result, following the consummation of the Proposed Merger and the completion by AES of its purchase price allocation, the cost basis of certain of assets and liabilities will be adjusted and any resulting goodwill or negative goodwill will be allocated and pushed down to . Although we believe that AES is still in the preliminary stages of determining the adjustments, which will be based on preliminary purchase price allocations and preliminary valuations of assets and liabilities (which will be subject to change within the applicable measurement period), these adjustments could have a material effect on future financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to increased depreciation, amortization, impairment and other non-cash charges. As a result, actual future results may not be comparable with results in prior periods.

Exhibit 99.3
On November 28, 2011, AES completed its acquisition of 100% of the common stock of DPL Inc. ("DPL"), the parent company of Dayton Power & Light Company ("DP&L"), a utility company based in Ohio, pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated as of April 19, 2011. DPL serves over 500,000 customers in Ohio, primarily West Central Ohio, through its operating subsidiaries DP&L and DPL Energy Resources ("DPLER"). Additionally, DPL operates over 3,800 MW of power generation facilities and provides competitive retail energy services to residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers. As part of the Acquisition, Dolphin Subsidiary II, Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of AES ("Merger Sub") merged with and into DPL, with DPL surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AES.
The Acquisition strengthens AES' U.S. utility operations by expanding in the Midwest and PJM, a regional transmission organization serving several eastern states as part of the Eastern Interconnection. The Company expects to benefit from the regional scale provided by Indianapolis Power & Light Company, our nearby integrated utility business in Indiana. The Acquisition is aligned with our strategy to grow in select markets while achieving operational efficiencies through greater scale.
AES funded the aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $3.5 billion through a combination of cash on hand (including the proceeds from a $1.05 billion term loan under a senior secured credit facility obtained in May 2011 and $1.0 billion notes issued in June 2011), the proceeds from a private offering in October 2011 of $450 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% senior notes due 2016 and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2021 (collectively, the "Notes") and temporary borrowings under AES' existing revolving credit facility.
The pro forma financial information reflecting the Acquisition is provided for informational purposes only. The pro forma information reflects preliminary estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time of preparation, including preliminary fair value estimates of assets and liabilities. The pro forma statements of operations are not necessarily indicative of what the companies' results of operations actually would have been had the Acquisition been completed at the dates indicated. In addition, the pro forma financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of AES. The pro forma balance sheet and statements of operations should be read in conjunction with:
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements (the "pro forma financial information") have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AES and DPL after giving effect to the Acquisition transaction and certain related financing transactions (i.e., borrowings under term loan and revolving credit facility and issuance of notes as discussed in the introductory paragraph), and after applying the assumptions, reclassifications and adjustments described in these notes to the pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated statements of operations ("pro forma statements of operations") for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 are presented as if the Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2010. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated balance sheet ("pro forma balance sheet") is presented based on the most recent balance sheets filed with the SEC assuming the Acquisition had occurred on September 30, 2011 as required under Article 11 of Regulation S-X.
Historical financial information has been adjusted in the pro forma financial information to give effect to pro forma events that are: (1) directly attributable to the Acquisition; (2) factually supportable; and (3) with respect to the statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on our results of operations (e.g., decreased depreciation and increased amortization expense on acquired tangible and intangible assets). The pro forma statements of operations do not reflect nonrecurring costs resulting from the Acquisition. The majority of acquisition-related nonrecurring costs include costs incurred to secure bridge financing to support the Acquisition, and fees paid to investment banking, legal and accounting professionals. In addition, AES will incur certain nonrecurring costs within the 12-month period following the Acquisition, primarily associated with services provided by investment banking, legal and accounting professionals. The pro forma statements of operations do not include the impact of any revenue, costs or other operating synergies that may result from the Acquisition. The pro forma adjustments presented in the pro forma financial information are described in Note 3.
Pro Forma Adjustments
The pro forma financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the accounting guidance on business combinations with AES identified as the acquirer. Accordingly, the historical financial information has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the purchase consideration for the Acquisition. Total purchase consideration has been allocated (a process generally referred to as a ) on a preliminary basis in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The difference between the fair value of these assets and liabilities and the purchase consideration paid has been recorded as goodwillAdjustments to the purchase price allocation during the measurement period may be up to one year from the date of acquisition. In business combinations, purchase price allocation is often subject to revisions as additional information becomes available and further analyses are performed. Therefore, it is possible that the final purchase price allocation could differ materially from the information presented in this pro forma financial information. Any pro forma adjustments presented in this pro forma financial information are preliminary and for informational purposes only.

.
DPL has been facing increased competition in both the wholesale generation and Competitive Retail Electric Service ("CRES") markets. As a result of these competitive changes, the Company is reviewing the expected long-term effects of these newer market conditions. A number of items included in the initial purchase price allocation will likely change as a result of this review process. These items include the value of the generation business related property, plant and equipment, the fair value of the Electric Security Plan
1
with its regulated customers, its long-term coal contracts and the 4.9% equity ownership interest in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation. DPLER, DPL's wholly-owned CRES provider, will also likely have changes in its initial purchase price allocation for the valuation of its trade name and customer relationships and contracts.
For purposes of determining the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, AES has applied the accounting guidance for business combinations. For the majority of assets and liabilities in DPL's
 
 
transmission and distribution business, primarily property, plant and equipment, fair value was determined to be their carrying amounts. Such operations are conducted in a regulated environment where the regulatory authority allows a reasonable rate of return on the carrying amount of the regulated asset base. In addition, certain fair value adjustments have been reflected on the pro forma balance sheet with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability based upon the expectation that if these fair value adjustments are realized, a portion of such amounts would be reflected in the future customer rates.
2. PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION
The preliminary purchase price allocation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has resulted in the identification of indefinite-lived intangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization, adjustments to the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and the recognition of goodwill. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price as of September 30, 2011 is given in the table below (in millions):
 
 
3. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
The adjustments included in the pro forma financial information are as follows:
Adjustments to Historical Financial Presentation
(a)   Certain reclassifications have been made to the presentation of DPL's consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and the year ended December 31, 2010, and consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011, to conform to the presentation used in the pro forma financial information. In addition, as permitted by Article 11 of Regulation S-X, certain line items in AES' and DPL's historical financial statements have been condensed for purposes of the pro forma financial information presentation. For the year ended December 31, 2010, AES' historical statement of operations included in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 1, 2011 has been adjusted to reflect the disposal of our telecommunication businesses in Brazil. These businesses were presented as discontinued operations for the first time in AES' historical statements of operations included in our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2011 filed with the SEC on November 3, 2011. These businesses were not significant to necessitate the filing of pro forma financial information on a Current Report on Form 8-K. Except for the effect of presenting the Brazil telecommunication businesses as discontinued operations, these adjustments do not have any impact on the historical income from continuing operations after taxes, total assets, total liabilities or equity reported by AES or DPL.
