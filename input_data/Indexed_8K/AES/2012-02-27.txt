AES Reports 6% Increase in Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $1.04 for 2011, Meeting or Exceeding Guidance Targets for All Key Metrics

The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported a 6% increase in Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) in 2011. New businesses in Europe and Latin America, demand and volume growth in Latin America, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates drove strong performance during the year. These trends were partially offset by the financing costs related to the acquisition of DPL Inc., the parent company of Dayton Power & Light (DP&L), a lower tariff at Eletropaulo in Brazil, and reduced contributions from certain European generation businesses.
ARLINGTON, Va., February 27, 2012 
"Last fall, we announced our plans to narrow our geographic focus, sell certain assets that are not core to our business and use our discretionary cash flow to maximize shareholder returns and continue to grow in key markets. Since then we have received almost $530 million in cash and signed sale agreements for another $230 million. At the same time, we commissioned 2,000 MW of new capacity last year and we completed the acquisition of DP&L, which adds an additional 3,800 MW of capacity and 500,000 distribution customers," said Andrs Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. "Looking forward, we will continue to execute on focusing and simplifying our portfolio while achieving incremental cost savings of $50 million in 2012 and another $50 million by the end of 2013. We expect to be able to deliver an increase in Adjusted EPS of 21% this year and average annual total returns to our shareholders of 8% to 10% from 2013 to 2015."
"We met or exceeded our 2011 guidance for Adjusted EPS and cash flow metrics, overcoming volatile macroeconomic and commodity conditions," said Victoria D. Harker, AES Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President of Global Business Services. "We will continue to benefit from the momentum of new capacity additions and cost savings initiatives, including the implementation of strategic sourcing programs and right-sizing our business platform. As a result, we expect to generate $1.15 billion in proportional free cash flow in 2012, a 23% increase over 2011. When combined with asset sales proceeds, we will have many levers available to us to achieve our total return commitments."

2012 Guidance
The midpoint of the Company's prior Adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 was based on commodity and foreign currency forward curves as of October 31, 2011. Consistent with its prior practice, the Company updated its 2012 guidance to reflect the forward curves for commodities and foreign currencies as of December 30, 2011. This resulted in a $0.06 reduction in the Adjusted EPS guidance midpoint. Accordingly, the Company has updated its Adjusted EPS midpoint to $1.26.
