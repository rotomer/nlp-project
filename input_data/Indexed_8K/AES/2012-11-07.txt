AES Reports Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $0.36 for Third Quarter 2012 and $0.91 for Year-To-Date 2012; Reaffirms 2012 Guidance Ranges for All Metrics; Increases Cost Savings Target By $45 Million
Third Quarter & Year-To-Date 2012 Results
 
 
 
Other Significant Announcements
 
 
 
 
 
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) today reported Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) of $0.36 for the third quarter of 2012 and $0.91 for the first nine months of 2012, in line with the Company's expectations. Third Quarter 2012 results were driven by the contributions of new businesses in the United States and Latin America, reduced SG&A expenses and a lower share count. These positive drivers were partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
ARLINGTON, Va, November 7, 2012 
"We continue to take important steps to better align the organization with our strategic goals. We recently announced a reorganization of the Company that will streamline how we work and decrease our company-wide overhead. As a result, we have increased our overhead cost savings target by $45 million to $145 million annually by 2014 from our starting point in 2011," said Andrs Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer. "Regarding capital allocation, we have executed on what we laid out as our first year plan last November by repurchasing $390 million of our stock and paying down or authorizing pre-payment of a total of $717 million in debt, largely with the proceeds from our focused asset sales. Next week, we will be paying our first quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, the Company's first cash dividend since 1993."
 
 
"Our third quarter results exceeded last year's results, driven by our new businesses in the United States and Latin America, cost cutting initiatives and the results of our capital allocation strategy," said Tom O'Flynn, AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "We are positioned to deliver on our 2012 commitments and we are reaffirming all of our 2012 guidance metrics."
