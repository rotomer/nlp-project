Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Senior members of Aetna Inc.s (the Companys) management team will be meeting with investors and analysts from August 26, 2008 through September 12, 2008.  Those discussions will focus on the Companys strategy, tactics and future outlook.  During these meetings, the Company intends to reaffirm its publicly disclosed third quarter and full-year 2008 guidance, which includes third quarter 2008 operating earnings of $1.12 per share and full-year 2008 operating earnings of $4.00 per share, and repeat its publicly disclosed expectation of solid operating earnings per share growth in 2009.

  Projected full-year 2008 operating earnings per share exclude after tax net realized capital losses of $52.3 million and the release of reserves for anticipated future losses on discontinued products of $28.5 million, after-tax, reported by the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2008.  Projected operating earnings per share also exclude from net income any net realized capital gains or losses and other items occurring after June 30, 2008.  The Company is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses or other items and cannot therefore reconcile projected operating earnings per share in any period to projected net income per share.  Projected full-year 2008 operating earnings assume less than 495 million weighted-average diluted shares.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- Certain information in this Form 8-K is forward looking, including our projections as to operating earnings per share and weighted-average diluted shares. Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetna's control. Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including failure to achieve desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to the slowing economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic markets where membership is concentrated; adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; adverse pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors; and adverse changes in federal or state government policies or regulation (including legislative proposals that would affect our business model and/or limit our ability to price for the risk we assume and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in our pricing, and other proposals, such as initiatives to eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws, that would increase potential litigation exposure or mandate coverage of certain health benefits). Other important risk factors include, but are not limited to:  unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased medical utilization, increased pharmacy costs, increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, changes in membership mix to lower-premium or higher-cost products or membership-adverse selection; as well as changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends); the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the ability to improve relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services we offer; reduced levels of investment income from low interest rates; the ability to successfully integrate our businesses (including acquired businesses) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; our ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance our existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including litigation and ongoing reviews of business practices by various regulatory authorities (including the current industry-wide investigation by the New York Attorney General into certain payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers); reputational issues arising from data security breaches or other means; and increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any acts of terrorism, epidemics or other extreme events.
