Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
As previously disclosed on September 18, 2008, Aetna Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, "Aetna") has a reinsurance recoverable (the Recoverable) in the amount of $163 million (at August 31, 2008) from an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  The Recoverable results from a 1999 transaction in which Lehman Re Ltd. (a Bermuda company, Lehman Re) reinsured a block of paid-up group whole life insurance policies issued by Aetna between 1941 and October 22, 1999.  On September 19, 2008, Aetna took possession of the assets supporting the Recoverable (the Assets), which previously were held as collateral in a trust.  On September 23, 2008, Lehman Re commenced proceedings in Bermuda to liquidate itself.  Given current market conditions, the value of the Assets may continue to fluctuate, and Aetna currently estimates that the Assets have a market value that is less than the amount of the Recoverable.  Aetna intends to pursue its claims in Lehman Res liquidation proceedings, including its claim for any amount by which Lehman Res obligations to Aetna exceed the Assets.  Aetna will assess the impact of these circumstances in connection with the preparation of its third quarter 2008 financial statements.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
