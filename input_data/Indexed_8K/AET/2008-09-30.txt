With the appointment of Mr. Harrington, Aetna's Board consists of thirteen directors.
Mr. Harrington was also appointed to the Boards Audit Committee and Investment and Finance Committee.
The Board affirmatively determined in its business judgment that Mr. Harrington is independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards and under Aetnas Director Independence Standards and that any relationship with Aetna or its subsidiaries (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of any organization that has a relationship with Aetna or its subsidiaries) is immaterial under the independence test thresholds contained in the NYSE listing standards and under Aetnas Director Independence Standards. 
In addition, the Board determined in its business judgment that Mr. Harrington meets the independence, financial literacy and expertise requirements for audit committee members set forth in the NYSE listing standards and that, based on his background and experience, Mr. Harrington has the requisite attributes of an audit committee financial expert as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Aetna will compensate Mr. Harrington in the manner and amounts and pursuant to the plans applicable to all Aetna Directors as described in the 2008 Aetna Inc. Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement, including fees related to service on Board committees.
