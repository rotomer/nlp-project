Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Senior members of Aetna Inc.s (the Companys) management team will be meeting with investors and analysts from March 9, 2009 through March 20, 2009.  The Company expects discussions at those meetings to focus on the Companys strategy, tactics and future outlook.  During these meetings, the Company intends to reaffirm its publicly disclosed 2009 guidance, which includes full-year 2009 operating earnings of $3.85 to $3.95 per share.

  Projected operating earnings per share exclude net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, from net income.  The Company is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses or other items and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings per share to projected net income per share.  Projected full-year 2009 operating earnings assume approximately 460 million weighted-average diluted shares.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- Certain information in this Current Report on Form 8-K is forward looking, including our projections as to operating earnings per share and weighted-average diluted shares.  Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetnas control.  Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad which can significantly and adversely affect Aetnas business and profitability; continued volatility and further deterioration of the U.S. and global capital markets, including fluctuations in interest rates, fixed income and equity prices and the value of financial assets, along with the general deterioration in the commercial paper, capital and credit markets, which can adversely impact the value of Aetnas investment portfolio, Aetnas profitability by reducing net investment income and/or Aetnas financial position by causing us to realize additional impairments on our investments; failure to achieve desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to the slowing economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic markets where membership is concentrated; adverse pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors; and unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased medical utilization, increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, increased pharmacy costs, changes in membership mix to lower-premium or higher-cost products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends); as well as adverse changes in federal or state government policies or regulation (including legislative proposals that would affect our business model and/or limit our ability to price for the risk we assume and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in our pricing and other proposals, such as initiatives to eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws, that would increase potential litigation exposure or mandate coverage of certain health benefits).  Other important risk factors include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership, the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the ability to improve relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services we offer; the ability to successfully integrate our businesses (including acquired businesses) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; our ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance our existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including litigation and ongoing reviews of business practices by various regulatory authorities (including the current industry-wide investigation by the New York Attorney General into certain payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers); reputational issues arising from data security breaches or other means; and increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any acts of terrorism, epidemics or other extreme events. For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetnas 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2008 Annual Report) on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  You also should read the 2008 Annual Report on file with the SEC for a discussion of Aetnas historical results of operations and financial condition.
