YSE: AET) today announced third-quarter 2009 operating earnings of $308.2 million, or $.69 per share, a 38 percent decrease from the prior-year quarter.  Operating earnings exclude net realized capital gains (losses) and other items.  The decrease in operating earnings per share from the prior-year quarter reflects a lower Commercial underwriting margin and a previously announced increase in pension expense partially offset by the impact of a lower number of shares outstanding year-over-year. The lower Commercial underwriting margin was due to a significant increase in Commercial medical costs which was partially offset by an increase in health care premiums.  Net income was $326.2 million, or $.73 per share, a 26 percent increase from the prior-year quarter, which included net realized capital losses of $.48 per share due to the then-deteriorating global economic conditions

"Our third-quarter financial results reflect a Total Medical Benefit Ratio that is in line with expectations despite a Commercial Medical Benefit Ratio that was higher than projected," said Ronald A. Williams, chairman and CEO.  "The higher-than-expected Commercial MBR was due primarily to greater-than-anticipated costs from the H1N1 flu and COBRA penetration rates.  
 
 
"We expect in 2010 that ongoing uncertainty about the U.S. economy with respect to employment and growth will continue to impact provider and member behavior as well as customer preferences.  Despite this uncertainty, we continue to have a great deal of confidence in our long-term future, given our well-positioned, diverse portfolio of businesses, our customer-focused strategy and our underlying financial strength.
 
Williams continued:  "Looking ahead, as the health care reform debate intensifies, we will continue to be an active, constructive voice for a bipartisan solution that gets and keeps everyone covered, builds on the strengths of the employer-based system, and addresses the underlying cost and affordability of health care.  We believe that the right reforms can yield positive, market based change that improves the health care system for more Americans."
 
Joseph M. Zubretsky, executive vice president and CFO, said, "The increase in net income in the third quarter was primarily a result of improved valuations in our investment portfolio.  Going forward, we expect that our ongoing medical cost management and pricing action plans will have a noticeable effect beginning in the first quarter of 2010, with additional financial impact realized during the remaining three quarters of the year.  As we work through the challenges facing us, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity remain strong and we are committed to making sure our operating expense structure is appropriately aligned with the size, profile and needs of our customers.

Operating earnings exclude net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, from net income.  Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that operating earnings and operating earnings per share provide a more useful comparison of Aetnas underlying business performance from period to period.  Management uses operating earnings to assess business performance and to make decisions regarding Aetnas operations and allocation of resources among Aetnas businesses. Operating earnings is also the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for these purposes.

Each of the excluded items is discussed below:
Revenue excludes net realized capital gains and losses.
 
For a reconciliation of these items to financial measures calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), refer to the tables on pages 7 through 9 and page 11 of this press release.
 
Projected operating earnings per share exclude any future net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, from net income.  Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings to projected net income in any period.  Projected operating earnings per share for the full year 2009 assumes approximately 450 million weighted average diluted shares.

The Commercial MBR for the second quarter of 2009 reflected approximately $65 million pretax of unfavorable development of prior period health care cost estimates.  Including this development, the Commercial MBR for the second quarter of 2009 was 85.9%.
(3)
 
The operating expense ratio excludes net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any.  Refer to a reconciliation of this metric to the comparable GAAP measure on page 9 of this press release.

In order to provide useful information regarding Aetnas profitability on a basis comparable to others in the industry, without regard to financing decisions, income taxes or amortization of other acquired intangible assets (each of which may vary for reasons not directly related to the performance of the underlying business), Aetnas pretax operating margin is based on operating earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Management also uses pre-tax operating margin to assess Aetnas performance, including performance versus competitors.

Includes an allowance on reinsurance recoverable and litigation-related insurance proceeds as described in footnote above.

Our Corporate Financing segment is not a business segment.  It is added to our business segments to reconcile to our consolidated results.  The Corporate Financing segment includes interest expense on our outstanding debt and, beginning in 2009, the financing components of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses (referred to herein as "pension expense") (the service cost (or operating component) of this expense is allocated to our business segments).  The service cost component allocated to our business segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009  was $10.7 million ($6.9 million after tax) and $32.0 million ($20.7 million after tax), respectively, and $9.5 million ($6.2 million after tax) and $28.3 million ($18.4 million after tax) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008, respectively. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- -- Certain information in this press release is forward-looking, including our projections as to operating earnings per share and weighted average diluted shares.  Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetnas control.  Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of the H1N1 flu, increased COBRA participation rates or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers; and increased pharmacy costs); adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of or rate of increase in the unemployment rate) which can significantly and adversely affect Aetnas business and profitability; failure to achieve desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to the slowing economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic markets where membership is concentrated; continued volatility and further deterioration of the U.S. and global capital markets, including fluctuations in interest rates, fixed income and equity prices and the value of financial assets, along with the general deterioration in the commercial paper, capital and credit markets, which can adversely impact the value of Aetnas investment portfolio, Aetnas profitability by reducing net investment income and/or Aetnas financial position by causing us to realize additional impairments on our investments; adverse pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors; adverse changes in federal or state government policies or regulation (including legislative proposals that would affect our business model and/or limit our ability to price for the risk we assume and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in our pricing and other proposals, such as initiatives to mandate minimum medical benefit ratios or eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws, that would increase potential litigation exposure or mandate coverage of certain health benefits); and the ability to improve relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services we offer.  Other important risk factors include, but are not limited to: adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the ability to successfully integrate our businesses (including acquired businesses) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; our ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance our existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by various regulatory authorities of, certain of our payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers; and reputational issues arising from data security breaches or other means. For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetna's 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Aetnas 2009 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 and Aetnas Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 (Aetnas Third Quarter 10-Q), when filed with the SEC.
