News Release
 Aetna (NYSE:AET) announced today that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) notified the company of its intent to impose intermediate sanctions suspending the enrollment of and marketing to new members of all Aetna Medicare Advantage and Standalone Prescription Drug Plan Contracts, effective April 21, 2010.  The sanctions relate to compliance with certain Medicare Part D requirements, primarily those relating to changes in the drugs covered by certain plans from 2009 to 2010.
HARTFORD, Conn., April 9, 2010
The suspension does not affect current Aetna Medicare enrollees.  Aetna is cooperating fully with CMS on its review, and is working to resolve the issues CMS has raised as soon as possible.
Compliance problems are unacceptable to Aetna; the issues raised to us by CMS have our utmost attention, said Aetna President Mark T. Bertolini.  Aetna takes our obligations to our Medicare beneficiaries seriously, and our priority is to help ensure they have access to high-quality care, excellent service and needed medications.  We are working with CMS to resolve these matters, and we also will be doing proactive outreach to impacted members to resolve these issues.
