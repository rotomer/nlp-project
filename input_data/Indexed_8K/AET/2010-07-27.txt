News Release
 
YSE: AET) today announced second-quarter 2010 operating earnings of $450.2 million, or $1.05 per share, an increase of 54 percent over 2009.  The increase was largely the result of a higher Commercial underwriting margin from favorable prior-period reserve development and improved underlying performance, partially offset by lower Commercial Insured membership.  Second-quarter results included favorable prior - -period reserve development of $0.30 per share, primarily from first quarter 2010 incurred health care costs.  Excluding prior-period reserve development, second quarter 2010 operating earnings per share were $0.75.

"Our second-quarter results reflect the positive impact of disciplined, focused initiatives to improve our performance, said Ronald A. Williams, chairman and CEO. "Going forward, our focus on performance improvement will enable us to continue to make investments that help address the challenges our customers facewith respect to affordability and quality in health care.
 
 
Aetna's leadership in helping to build a better, more information-driven health care marketplacehas been a fundamental dimension of ourstrategy during the past decade, and it continues to evolve. For example, last quarter we expanded the availability of our payment estimator, an innovative decision support tool, to our entire customer base. This will create a unique level of cost transparency for our customers at a time when they face significant challenges."
 
 
 
Our improved performance in the first half of 2010, along with a strong capital position, gives us confidence in our ability to execute on our goals, said Joseph M. Zubretsky, executive vice president and CFO. We expect the remainder of 2010 will reflect the impact of business investments for future profitable growth, as well as the need to prepare for health care reform and regulatory changes. As a result, we now project full-year 2010 operating results per share to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.15.

Operating earnings exclude net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, from net income.  Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that operating earnings and operating earnings per share provide a more useful comparison of Aetnas underlying business performance from period to period.  Management uses operating earnings to assess business performance and to make decisions regarding Aetnas operations and allocation of resources among Aetnas businesses. Operating earnings is also the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for these purposes.
(1)
 
The following items are excluded from operating earnings because we believe they neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance:
For a reconciliation of these items to financial measures calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), refer to the tables on pages 7 through 9 and 11 of this press release.
 
Certain metrics are adjusted to exclude noted development of prior-period health care cost estimates. These metrics include operating earnings, operating earnings per share and medical benefit ratios.
(2)
 
(3)
Projected operating earnings per share exclude any future net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, from net income.  Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings to projected net income in any period.  Projected operating earnings per share also exclude one-time costs associated with our agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation, which we expect to incur in the second half of 2010.  Projected ope rating earnings per share for the full year 2010 reflect approximately 426 million weighted average diluted shares.
 
The operating expense ratio excludes net realized capital gains and losse and other items, if any.  Refer to a reconciliation of this metric to the comparable GAAP measure on page 9 of this press release.

In order to provide useful information regarding Aetnas profitability on a basis comparable to others in the industry, without regard to financing decisions, income taxes or amortization of other acquired intangible assets (each of which may vary for reasons not directly related to the performance of the underlying business), Aetnas pretax operating margin is based on operating earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Management also uses pre-tax operating margin to assess Aetnas performance, including performance versus competitors.
(6)
 
Revenue and operating expense information is presented before income taxes.  Operating earnings, and operating earnings, excluding prior-period development information is presented net of income taxes.
(7)
 
Our Corporate Financing segment is not a business segment.  It is added to our business segments to reconcile to our consolidated results.  The Corporate Financing segment includes interest expense on our outstanding debt and the financing components of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- -- Certain information in this press release is forward-looking, including our projections as to operating earnings per share, weighted average diluted shares and the impact of our agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation and our preparations for health care reform and regulatory changes. Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetna's control. Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, particularly the implementation of health care reform legislation. Health care reform will significantly impact our business operations and financial results, including our medical benefit ratios.  Components of the legislation will be phased in over the next eig ht years, and we will be required to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses during that time to implement health care reform.  Many significant parts of the legislation require further guidance and clarification in the form of regulations.  As a result, many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known until those regulations are enacted, which we expect to occur over the next several years.  Other important risk factors include adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of or rate of increase in the unemployment rate); adverse changes in federal or state government policies or regulations as a result of health care reform or otherwise (including legislative measures that would affect our business model, limit our ability to price for the risk we assume and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in our pricing, such as mandated minimum medical benefit ratios, eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emp tion of state laws (increasing our potential litigation exposure) or mandate coverage of certain health benefits); our ability to differentiate our products and solutions from those offered by our competitors, and demonstrate that our products lead to access to better quality of care by our members; unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of the H1N1 flu, increased COBRA participation rates or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, and increased pharmacy costs); failure to achieve desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to the slowing economy, regulatory restrictions and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic markets where membership is concentrated; adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; adverse pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors; our ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance our existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the ability to successfully integrate our businesses (including acquired businesses) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; managing CEO succession and retention of key executive talent; the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including the CMS review and sanctions, litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by vario us regulatory authorities of, certain of our payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers; reputational issues arising from data security breaches or other means; the ability to improve relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services we offer; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; and a downgrade in our financial ratings. Important risk factors that could materially affect statements made concerning our agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation include without limitation the timely receipt of necessary regulatory and other approvals, which could be delayed for a variety of reasons related or not related to the agreement itself, and the ability to successfully implement the CVS Caremark agreement on a timely basis and in a cost-efficient manner and to achieve projected operating efficiencies for the agreement.  For more discussion of important risk fact ors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetna's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Aetnas Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, each on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Aetnas Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 (Aetnas Second Quarter 10-Q), when filed with the SEC.
