News Release
 
 
 
 
YSE: AET) today announced fourth-quarter 2010 operating earnings of $255.0 million, or $.63 per share, a per share increase of 58 percent over 2009.  Full-year share, a per share increase of 34 perc ent over 2009. The increase in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 operating earnings were largely the result of higher Commercial underwriting margins driven by management actions to appropriately price the business, and lower utilization, as well as a reduced number of shares outstanding, partially offset by lower Commercial Insured membership.  Full-year 2010 operating earnings also reflect favorable prior-period reserve development.  Net income for the fourth quarter was $215.6 million, or $.53 per share, including $.10 per share of net realized capital gains and other items.  Full-year net income was $1.8 billion, or $4.18 per share, a per share increase of 47 percent over 2009.

Aetnas strong operating results in 2010 demonstrate the significant performance improvement we have made by remaining disciplined while focusing on customer needs, said Ronald A. Williams, chairman. As it becomes even more imperative to address quality and affordability in health care, Aetna will play an increasingly important role. I am confident that we are well-positioned with the right management team and long-term strategy to capitalize on the domestic and global opportunities in health care.
 
Our companys success, as always, is centered on creating value for our customers by offering innovative products and services that improve quality and help manage costs through integrated benefit designs and member engagement, said Mark T. Bertolini, CEO and president.  Even as we continue to navigate through a difficult economy, we are squarely focused on making investments in our business that can help meet the needs of current and future customers.

Aetnas strategic approach to capital management and diversification is centered on creating value for shareholders by deploying our strong cash flows to reinvest in our business, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders, said Joseph M. Zubretsky, senior executive president and CFO.  Our acquisition of Medicity, the innovative transaction with Vitality Re and the increased dividend announced separately today underscore our commitment to enhancing total return to our shareholders.

Aetna/4
 
 
 
Full-year 2010 operating earnings for Health Care were $1.7 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in 2009.  The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to higher Commercial underwriting margins driven by management actions to appropriately price the business, lower utilization and favorable prior period reserve development, partially offset by lower Commercial Insured membership in 2010. Our underwriting margins in 2010 and 2009 included $76 million after tax of favorable prior-period reserve development and $75 million after tax of unfavorable prior-period reserve development, respectively.  Full-year 2010 net income was $1.8 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in 2009.  Full-year 2010 Commercial MBR was 80.6 percent, compared to 84.5 percent for 2009.

Group Insurance business results
Group Insurance, which includes group life, disability and long-term care products, reported:
 
Full-year 2010 operating earnings for Group Insurance were $128.0 million, compared with $103.8 million in 2009.  The increase was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as well as improved underwriting margins in our disability products, partially offset by lower underwriting margins in our long-term care and life products. Full-year 2010 net income was $179.6 million, compared to $145.6 million in 2009.
 
 
Large Case Pensions business results
Large Case Pensions, which manages a variety of discontinued and other retirement and savings products, primarily qualified pension plans, reported:
 
Full-year 2010 operating earnings for Large Case Pensions were $27.8 million, compared with $32.2 million for 2009.  The decrease is consistent with the run-off nature of this segment. Full-year 2010 net income was $29.0 million, compared to $26.4 million for 2009.
 
 
 
Aetna/6
 
 
For full-year 2010, the operating expense ratio increased to 19.3 percent from 18.2 percent for 2009 reflecting seasonal spending and the implementation of the agreement with CVS Caremark and other major programs.  Including net realized capital gains and other items, these percentages were 19.0 percent and 18.4 percent for full-year 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Operating business performance from period to period.  Management uses operating earnings to assess business performance and to make decisions regarding Aetnas operations and allocation of resources among Aetnas businesses. Operating earnings is also the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for these purposes.

earnings and operating earnings per share exclude net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, from net income.  Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that operating earnings and operating earnings per share provide a more useful comparison of Aetnas underlying
 
The following items are excluded from operating earnings because we believe they neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance:
For a reconciliation of these items to financial measures calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), refer to the tables on pages 9 through 11 and 13 of this press release.
 
Projected operating earnings per share exclude any future net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, from net income.  Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains and losses and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings to projected net income in any period.  Projected operating earnings per share for the full year 2011 reflect approximately 384 million weighted average diluted shares.
(2)  
 
  Revenue excludes net realized capital gains and losses and the 2009 ESI settlement as noted in above.  Refer to tables on pages 10, 11 and 13 of this press release for a reconciliation of revenue excluding net realized capital gains and losses to revenue calculated under GAAP.

The operating expense ratio excludes net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any.  For a reconciliation of this metric to the comparable GAAP measure refer to page 11 of this press release.

In order to provide useful information regarding Aetnas profitability on a basis comparable to others in the industry, without regard to financing decisions, income taxes or amortization of other acquired intangible assets (each of which may vary for reasons not directly related to the performance of the underlying business), Aetnas pretax operating margin is based on operating earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Management also uses pretax operating margin to assess Aetnas performance, including performance versus competitors.

Revenue and operating expense information is presented before income taxes.  Operating earnings is presented net of income taxes.

Our Corporate Financing segment is not a business segment. It is added to our business segments to reconcile to our consolidated results. The Corporate Financing segment includes interest expense on our outstanding debt and the financing components of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- -- Certain information in this press release is forward-looking, including our projections as to operating earnings per share and weighted average diluted shares, and the timing and amount of any future dividends.  Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetna's control.  Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, particularly the implementation of health care reform legislation and changes in Aetnas future cash requirements, capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.  Health care reform will significantly impact our business operations and financial results, including our medical benefit ratios.  Components of the legislation will be phased in over the next seven years, and we will be required to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses during that time to implement health care reform.  Many significant parts of the legislation, including medical loss ratios, require further guidance and clarification both at the federal level and in the form of regulations and actions by state legislatures to implement the law.  As a result, many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for the next several years.  Other important risk factors include adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of or rate of increase in the unemployment rate); adverse changes in health care reform and/or other federal or state government policies or regulations as a result of health care reform, changes in health care reform or otherwise (including legislative, judicial or regulatory measures that would affect our business model, restrict funding for various aspects of health care reform, limit our ability to price for the risk we assume and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in our pricing, such as mandated minimum medical benefit ratios, eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws (increasing our potential litigation exposure) or mandate coverage of certain health benefits); our ability to differentiate our products and solutions from those offered by our competitors, and demonstrate that our products lead to access to better quality of care by our members; unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of the H1N1 or other flu, increased COBRA participation rates or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, and increased pharmacy costs); failure to achieve and/or delays in achieving desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to regulatory restrictions, the difficult economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic areas where membership is concentrated; adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; our ability to diversify our sources of revenue and earnings; adverse pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors; the ability to successfully implement our agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation on a timely basis and in a cost-efficient manner a nd to achieve projected operating efficiencies for the agreement; our ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance our existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the success of our health information technology initiatives; the ability to successfully integrate our businesses (including acquired businesses) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; managing executive succession and key talent retention, recruitment and development; the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including the sanctions imposed on us by CMS, the CMS risk adjustment audits of certain of our Medicare contracts, guaranty fund assessments and litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by various regulatory authorities of, certain of our payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers; reputat ional issues arising from data security breaches or other means; the ability to improve relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services we offer; our ability to maintain our relationships with third party brokers, consultants and agents who sell our products; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; and a downgrade in our financial ratings. For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetna's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K (Aetnas 2009 Annual Report) and Aetnas Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010 (Aetnas Quarterly Reports), each on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).
