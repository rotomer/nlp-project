News Release
 
 
 
YSE: AET) today announced second-quarter 2011 operating earnings of $522.8 million, or $1.35 per share, a per share increase of 29 percent over 2010. The increase in the second quarter operating earnings was largely the result of higher Commercial underwriting margins from improved underlying performance, partially offset by the effect of lower Commercial Insured membership in 2011.  Second-quarter results included favorable prior-period reserve development of $.31 per share, primarily from first quarter 2011 incurred health care costs.  Second-quarter net income per share was $1.39.

For the first half of 2011, operating earnings per share were $2.78, including $.32 per share of favorable prior-years reserve development primarily from 2010 incurred health care costs.  Net income per share was $2.88 for the first half of 2011.

Aetna's second-quarter financial results reflect strong operating fundamentals across the enterprise, said Mark T. Bertolini, chairman, CEO and president. "Three main factors account for our success: disciplined pricing and medical cost management; lower than anticipated utilization of health care services by our members; and strong cash flow generation. The result has been better-than-projected financial results in the first half of 2011.
 
"Our long-term strategy remains focused on delivering profitable growth and consistent performance through a diversified portfolio of businesses.  Our business units are generally performing very well as we acquire new capabilities to enhance our value proposition.  I am pleased with the initial progress of our Accountable Care Solutions model for collaboration with high-quality health systems such as Carilion Clinic, Heartland Health and Emory Healthcare. We believe this new model will help create the transformational change people are looking for in health care, said Bertolini. 
 
Our strong financial position and prudent capital management have allowed us to capitalize on marketplace opportunities," said Joseph M. Zubretsky, senior executive vice president and CFO. "We have deployed capital to fund several strategic acquisitions in recent quarters, as well as share repurchases and an increased dividend.  We believe we can benefit both our customers and shareholders by continuing to invest to strengthen our core business and create new growth opportunities
.
 
"Based on our results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we now project full-year 2011 operating earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.70.

Operating earnings and operating earnings per share exclude net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, from net income.  Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that operating earnings and operating earnings per share provide a more useful mparison of Aetnas underlying business performance from period to period.  Management uses operating earnings to assess business performance and to make decisions regarding Aetnas operations and allocation of resources among Aetnas businesses. Operating earnings is also the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for these purposes.
co
 
The following items are excluded from operating earnings because we believe they neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance:
For a reconciliation of these items to financial measures calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), refer to the tables on pages 8 through 10 and 12 of this press release.
 
Projected operating earnings per share exclude any future net realized capital gains and losses and other items, including any charge relating to our voluntary early retirement program, from net income.  Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains and losses and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings to projected net income in any period.  Projected operating earnings per share 2011 reflect approximately 384 million weighted average diluted shares.

Revenue excludes net realized capital gains and losses as noted in above.  Refer to the tables on pages 9, 10 and 12 of this press release for a reconciliation of revenue excluding net realized capital gains and losses to revenue calculated under GAAP.

The operating expense ratio reflects the inclusion of the Corporate Financing segment in operating expenses and excludes net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any.  For a reconciliation of this metric to the comparable GAAP measure refer to page 10 of this press release.

In order to provide useful information regarding Aetnas profitability on a basis comparable to others in the industry, without regard to financing decisions, income taxes or amortization of other acquired intangible assets (each of which may vary for reasons not directly related to the performance of the underlying business), Aetnas pretax operating margin is based on operating earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Management also uses pretax operating margin to assess Aetnas performance, including performance versus competitors.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- -- Certain information in this press release is forward-looking, including our projections as to operating earnings per share, the impact of our Accountable Care Solutions model and weighted average diluted shares. Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetna's control. Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, particularly the implementation of health care reform legislation and changes in Aetnas future cash requirements, capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Health care reform will significantly impact our business operations and financial results, including our medical benefit ratios.  Components of the legislation will be phased in over the next seven years, and we will be required to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses during that time to implement health care reform.  Many significant parts of the legislation, including health insurance exchanges and the implementation of medical loss ratios, require further guidance and clarification both at the federal level and in the form of regulations and actions by state legislatures to implement the law.  As a result, many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for the next several years.  Other important risk factors include adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of or rate of increase in the unemployment rate); adverse changes in health care reform and/or other federal or state government policies or regulations as a result of health care reform, changes in health care reform or otherwise (including legislative, judicial or regulatory measures that would affect our business model, restrict funding for various aspects of health care reform, limit our ability to price for the risk we assume and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in our pricing, such as mandated minimum medical benefit ratios, eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws (increasing our potential litigation exposure) or mandate coverage of certain health benefits); our ability to differentiate our products and solutions from those offered by our competitors, and demonstrate that our products lead to access to better quality of care by our members; unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of the H1N1 or other flu, increased COBRA participation rates or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, and increased pharmacy costs); failure to achieve and/or delays in achieving desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to regulatory restrictions, the difficult economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic areas where membership is concentrated; adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; our ability to diversify our sources of revenue and earnings; adverse program, pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors; the ability to successfully implement our agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation on a timely basis and in a cost-efficient manner and to achieve projected operating efficiencies for the agreement; our ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance our existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the success of our health information technology initiatives; the ability to successfully integrate our businesses (including Medicity, Prodigy Health Group and other businesses we acquire) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; managing executive succession and key talent retention, recruitment and development; the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including the CMS risk adjustment audits of certain of our Medicare contracts, guaranty fund assessments and litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by various regulatory authorities of, certain of our payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers; reputational issues arising from data security breaches or other means; the ability to improve relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services we offer; our ability to maintain our relationships with third party brokers, consultants and agents who sell our products; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; and a downgrade in our financial ratings. For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetna's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and Aetnas Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 (Aetnas Second Quarter 10-Q), when filed with the SEC.
