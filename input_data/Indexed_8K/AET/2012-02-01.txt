Our excellent operating performance caps off a strong year for Aetna, our customers and our shareholders, said Mark T. Bertolini, Aetna chairman, CEO and president. During 2011, we made strategic investments in acquisitions and technologies that created a unique set of capabilities to both extend Aetna's core health business and poise us to capitalize on exciting new consumer and provider opportunities emerging in the marketplace.
Our goal is to evolve to a more consumer-centric company that provides health solutions to help people live healthier lives. We are combining our innovative health benefits, cutting-edge technologies and collaborative provider relationships to create a health system that is higher quality, more connected, convenient and cost-effective. Aetna's Accountable Care Solutions (ACS) business is using our new capabilities to bring providers and patients closer together, with our latest community launches in St. Joseph, Missouri; Phoenix; and San Diego. Our most recent win is with the State of Maine, where we have been awarded both an administrative services contract covering the State's 33,000 employees and their families and a contract to develop ACO models across the State. This success underscores the strength of our core business and how our ACS investments are enhancing that core, said Bertolini.

In the fourth quarter and throughout the year, Aetna's commercial underwriting performance benefited from low medical utilization, our pricing discipline, our medical cost management strategies and our unit cost controls," said Joseph M. Zubretsky, Aetna senior executive vice president and CFO. Aetna's strong operating results and significant capital generation allow us to continue investing for the future.
In 2012 we are again looking for ways to enhance shareholder value through effective capital deployment. We recently closed the Vitality Re III reinsurance transaction for catastrophe risk protection, which frees up capital that can be used in an accretive manner. With this transaction and our substantial operating cash flows, we now expect to have $1.35 billion of deployable capital for 2012, said Zubretsky.

Full-year
2011 operating earnings for Health Care were
$1.96 billion
, compared with
$1.65 billion
in 2010. The increase in operating earnings was largely the result of strong performance across all product lines, a continued result of low medical utilization, disciplined execution of our pricing and medical cost management strategies and unit cost controls. Our underwriting margins in 2011 and 2010 included $207 million before tax and $118 million before tax of favorable prior-years reserve development, respectively.
Full-year
2011 net income was
$1.95 billion

Full-year
2011 operating earnings for Group Insurance were
$153.0 million
, compared with

in 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher underwriting margins on our life and disability products partially offset by lower underwriting margins on our long-term care products.

$181.8 million
, compared to
$179.6 million
in 2010.

(1)
Operating earnings and operating earnings per share exclude from net income net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance. Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that operating earnings and operating earnings per share provide a more useful comparison of Aetna's underlying business performance from period to period. Management uses operating earnings to assess business performance and to make decisions regarding Aetna's operations and allocation of resources among Aetna's businesses. Operating earnings is also the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for these purposes.
The following items are excluded from operating earnings because we believe they neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance:
For a reconciliation of these items to financial measures calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), refer to the tables on pages 9 through 11 and 13 of this press release.
(2)
Projected operating earnings per share exclude from net income any future net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance. Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains and losses or any such other items and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings to projected net income in any period. Projected operating earnings per share for the full year 2012 reflect approximately 353 million weighted average diluted shares.
(3)
Revenue excludes net realized capital gains and losses as noted in
(1)
above. Refer to the tables on pages 10, 11 and 13 of this press release for a reconciliation of revenue excluding net realized capital gains and losses to revenue calculated under GAAP.
(4)
The operating expense ratio reflects the inclusion of the Corporate Financing segment in operating expenses and excludes net realized capital gains and losses and other items, if any. For a reconciliation of this metric to the comparable GAAP measure refer to page 11 of this press release.
(5)
In order to provide useful information regarding Aetna's profitability on a basis comparable to others in the industry, without regard to financing decisions, income taxes or amortization of other acquired intangible assets (each of which may vary for reasons not directly related to the performance of the underlying business), Aetna's pretax operating margin is based on operating earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. Management also uses pretax operating margin to assess Aetna's performance, including performance versus competitors.
(6)
Revenue and operating expense information is presented before income taxes. Operating earnings is presented net of income taxes.
(7)
Our Corporate Financing segment is not a business segment. It is added to our business segments to reconcile to our consolidated results. The Corporate Financing segment includes interest expense on our outstanding debt and the financing components of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses.
(8)
Represents members in consumer-directed health plans included in Aetna's Commercial medical membership.
(9)
Represents members in products that allow these members access to Aetna's dental provider network for a nominal fee.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT; ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- -- Certain information in this press release is forward-looking, including our projections as to operating earnings per share, deployable capital and weighted average diluted shares. Forward-looking information is based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and is subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetna's control. Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, particularly the implementation of health care reform legislation and changes in Aetna's future cash requirements, capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Health care reform will significantly impact our business operations and financial results, including our medical benefit ratios. Components of the legislation will be phased in over the next six years, and we will be required to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses during that time to implement health care reform. Many significant parts of the legislation, including health insurance exchanges and the implementation of medical loss ratios, require further guidance and clarification both at the federal level and in the form of regulations and actions by state legislatures to implement the law. As a result, many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for the next several years. Other important risk factors include adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of or rate of increase in the unemployment rate); adverse changes in health care reform and/or other federal or state government policies or regulations as a result of health care reform, changes in health care reform or otherwise (including legislative, judicial or regulatory measures that would affect our business model, restrict funding for various aspects of health care reform, limit our ability to price for the risk we assume and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in our pricing, such as mandated minimum medical benefit ratios, eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws (increasing our potential litigation exposure) or mandate coverage of certain health benefits); our ability to differentiate our products and solutions from those offered by our competitors, and demonstrate that our products lead to access to better quality of care by our members; unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of flu, increased COBRA participation rates or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, and increased pharmacy costs); failure to achieve and/or delays in achieving desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to regulatory review or other regulatory restrictions, the difficult economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic areas where membership is concentrated; adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; our ability to diversify our sources of revenue and earnings; adverse program, pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors; the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the ability to successfully implement our agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation on a timely basis and in a cost-efficient manner and to achieve projected operating efficiencies for the agreement; our ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance our existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the success of our health information technology initiatives; the ability to successfully integrate our businesses (including Medicity, Prodigy Health Group, PayFlex, and Genworth Financial Inc.'s Medicare Supplement business and other businesses we acquire in the future) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; managing executive succession and key talent retention, recruitment and development; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including the CMS risk adjustment audits of certain of our Medicare contracts, guaranty fund assessments and litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by various regulatory authorities of, certain of our payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers and/or life insurance policies; reputational issues arising from our social media activities, data security breaches, other cybersecurity risks or other causes; the ability to develop and maintain relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services we offer; our ability to maintain our relationships with third party brokers, consultants and agents who sell our products; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; and a downgrade in our financial ratings.
