Item 8.01.        Other Events.
Aetna Inc. () and Coventry Health Care, Inc.

The acquisition is projected to add nearly 4 million medical members and 1.5 million Medicare Part D members to Aetnas membership.  On a pro forma basis, the transaction increases Aetnas share of revenues from Government business to over 30 percent from 23 percent currently.

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by the board of directors of each company, Coventry stockholders will receive $27.30 in cash and 0.3885 Aetna common shares for each Coventry share, or $42.08 per share, based on the closing price of Aetna common shares on Friday, August 17, 2012.  Aetna expects to finance the cash portion of the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and by issuing approximately $2.5 billion of new debt and commercial paper.  Excluding transaction and integration costs, the transaction is projected to be modestly accretive to Aetnas operating earnings per share in 2013, $0.45 accretive in 2014 and $0.90 accretive in 2015.

Projected operating earnings per share excludes from net income any net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of Aetnas business nor reflect Aetnas underlying business performance. Projected operating earnings per share also exclude projected integration and one-time transaction costs related to the acquisition of Coventry Health Care, Inc. Aetna is not able to project the amount of future net realized capital gains or losses or any such other items (other than the projected integration and one-time transaction costs related to the Coventry acquisition) and therefore cannot reconcile projected operating earnings per share to projected net income per share in any period. Although the excluded items may recur, management believes that operating earnings per share provide a more useful comparison of Aetnas underlying business performance from period to period. Net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of liabilities. However, these transactions do not directly relate to the underwriting or servicing of products for customers and are not directly related to the core performance of Aetnas business operations. In addition, management uses operating earnings to assess business performance and to make decisions regarding Aetnas operations and allocation of resources among Aetnas businesses. Operating earnings is also the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for these purposes.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can generally identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, explore, evaluate, intend, may, might, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, or will, or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Aetnas and Coventrys control.
Statements in this document regarding Aetna that are forward-looking, including Aetnas projections as to the anticipated benefits of the pending transaction to Aetna, increased membership as a result of the pending transaction, the impact of the pending transaction on Aetnas businesses and share of revenues from Government business, the methods Aetna will use to finance the cash portion of the transaction, the impact of the transaction on Aetnas operating earnings per share, the synergies from the pending transaction, and the closing date for the pending transaction, are based on managements estimates, assumptions and projections, and are subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetnas control.  Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including, but not limited to: the timing to consummate the proposed acquisition; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed acquisition may not be satisfied; the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed acquisition is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; Aetnas ability to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the proposed acquisition; Aetnas ability to promptly and effectively integrate Coventrys businesses; the diversion of management time on acquisition-related issues; and the implementation of health care reform legislation and changes in Aetnas future cash requirements, capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.  Health care reform will significantly impact Aetnas business operations and financial results, including Aetnas medical benefit ratios.  Components of the legislation will be phased in over the next six years, and Aetna will be required to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses during that time to implement health care reform.  Many significant parts of the legislation, including health insurance exchanges, Medicaid expansion, the scope of essential benefits, employer penalties and the implementation of minimum medical loss ratios, require further guidance and clarification both at the federal level and/or in the form of regulations and actions by state legislatures to implement the law.  In addition, pending efforts in the U.S. Congress to repeal, amend, or restrict funding for various aspects of health care reform, the 2012 presidential and congressional elections, and the possibility of additional litigation challenging aspects of the law continue to create additional uncertainty about the ultimate impact of health care reform.  As a result, many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for the next several years.  Other important risk factors include: adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of, or increases in the rate of, unemployment); adverse changes in health care reform and/or other federal or state government policies or regulations as a result of health care reform or otherwise (including legislative, judicial or regulatory measures that would affect Aetnas business model, restrict funding for or amend various aspects of health care reform, limit Aetnas ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in its pricing, such as mandated minimum medical benefit ratios, eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws (increasing Aetnas potential litigation exposure) or mandate coverage of certain health benefits); Aetnas ability to differentiate its products and solutions from those offered by its competitors, and demonstrate that its products lead to access to better quality of care by its members; unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of flu, increased COBRA participation rates or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, and increased pharmacy costs); failure to achieve and/or delays in achieving desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to regulatory review or other regulatory restrictions, the difficult economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic areas where membership is concentrated, including successful protests of business awarded to us; adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; Aetnas ability to diversify its sources of revenue and earnings; adverse program, pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors, including curtailment or elimination of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services star rating bonus payments; the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the ability to successfully implement Aetnas agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation on a timely basis and in a cost-efficient manner and to achieve projected operating efficiencies for the agreement; Aetnas ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance its existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the success of Aetnas health information technology initiatives; Aetnas ability to successfully integrate its businesses (including Medicity, Prodigy Health Group, PayFlex, and Genworth Financial Inc.s Medicare Supplement business and other businesses Aetna may acquire in the future, including Coventry) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; managing executive succession and key talent retention, recruitment and development; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including guaranty fund assessments and litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by various regulatory authorities of, certain of Aetnas payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers and/or life insurance policies; reputational issues arising from its social media activities, data security breaches, other cybersecurity risks or other causes; the ability to develop and maintain relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services Aetna offers; Aetnas ability to maintain its relationships with third party brokers, consultants and agents who sell Aetnas products; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; and a downgrade in Aetnas financial ratings.  For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetnas Annual Report and Aetnas Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 (Aetnas First Quarter 10-Q) and Aetnas Second Quarter 10-Q (together with Aetnas First Quarter 10-Q, Aetnas Quarterly Reports), each on file with the SEC.

Statements in this document regarding Coventry that are forward-looking, including but not limited to the anticipated benefits of the transaction to Coventry, the projected closing date, the closing of the transaction, and the projected membership additions to Aetna, are based on Coventrys managements estimates, assumptions and projections, and are subject to significant uncertainties and risks, many of which are beyond the control of Coventrys management, including but not limited to: the failure to receive, on a timely basis or otherwise, the required approvals by Coventrys stockholders and government or regulatory agencies; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed transaction may not be satisfied; Coventrys and Aetnas ability to consummate the proposed transaction; the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies from the proposed transaction cannot be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the failure by Aetna to obtain the necessary financing in connection with the proposed transaction; the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of Coventrys and Aetnas operations will be greater than expected; operating costs and business disruption may be greater than expected; the ability of Coventry to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with providers or other business partners pending the consummation of the proposed transaction; and the implementation of health care reform legislation.

For a further discussion of risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors described in Coventrys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (Coventry Annual Report), Coventrys Quarterly Report for the quarter ending March 31, 2012 (Coventry First Quarter 10-Q), and Coventrys Quarterly Report for the quarter ending June 30, 2012 (together with Coventrys First Quarter 10-Q, Coventry Quarterly Reports), each on file with the SEC.

Neither Aetna nor Coventry assumes any duty to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, as of any future date.
