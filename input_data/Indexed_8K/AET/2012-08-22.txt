At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Coventry common stock (other than treasury shares held by Coventry and any shares of Coventry common stock beneficially owned by Aetna, Merger Sub or any person who properly demands statutory appraisal of his or her shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.3885 (the ) shares of Aetna common stock (the ) and (ii) $27.30 in cash (the  and, together with the Per Share Stock Consideration, the ), without interest. Each option to purchase shares of Coventry common stock outstanding under any employee benefit plan (each, a ), whether or not vested or exercisable, with a per share exercise price less than the Equity Award Cash Consideration (as defined below), shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the sum of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration (y) the value equal to the product of the Parent Stock Price (as defined below) the Exchange Ratio (the sum of the amounts in clauses (x) and (y), the ) over (2) the applicable per share exercise price of such Coventry Stock Option (B) the total number of shares of Coventry common stock subject to such Coventry Stock Option. For purposes of the Merger Agreement, the  means the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of Aetna common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Aetna and Coventry) on each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is two trading days prior to the closing date of the Merger During the 60-day period commencing on the date of the Merger Agreement, Aetna, in consultation with Coventry, will consider, after taking into account the terms and conditions of each applicable Coventry Stock Option, the appropriate treatment of each Coventry Stock Option, whether or not vested or exercisable, with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Equity Award Cash Consideration.

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Coventry common stock outstanding that is subject to forfeiture risk under any employee benefit plan and that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of the Merger Agreement, is vested or becomes vested as of the effective time of the Merger shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the effective time of the Merger, each performance share unit and restricted stock unit outstanding under any employee benefit plan (collectively, ) that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of the Merger Agreement, is vested or becomes vested as of the effective time of the Merger shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of the Equity Award Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Coventry common stock represented by such unit.
Coventry Stock Units
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each Coventry Stock Unit that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of the Merger Agreement, is not vested and will not become vested as of the effective time of the Merger shall convert at the effective time of the Merger into a cash-settled restricted stock unit with the number of shares of Aetna common stock underlying such cash-settled restricted stock unit equal to (1) the number of shares of Coventry common stock subject to such Coventry Stock Unit immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by (2) the Equity Award Cash Consideration divided by the Parent Stock Price. Each such cash-settled restricted stock unit shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including service-based vesting) as applied to the corresponding Coventry Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Aetna and Coventry each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants by each of Coventry and Aetna to, subject to certain exceptions, conduct its business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger.
The obligation of the parties to consummate the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by Coventrys stockholders, the absence of legal impediments to the consummation of the Merger, the receipt of specified governmental consents and approvals, the early termination or expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, compliance by Coventry and Aetna in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement and, subject in most cases to exceptions that do not rise to the level of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the accuracy of representations and warranties made by Coventry and Aetna, respectively. The obligation of the parties to consummate the Merger is not subject to any financing condition.
The Merger Agreement requires Coventry to convene a stockholders meeting for purposes of obtaining the necessary Coventry stockholder approval and, subject to certain exceptions, Coventry has agreed (i) not to solicit alternative transactions or enter into discussions concerning, or provide information in connection with, any alternative transaction and (ii) that Coventrys board of directors will recommend that Coventrys stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.
Prior to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by Coventrys stockholders, Coventrys board of directors may, upon receipt of a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and in certain other circumstances, change its recommendation that Coventrys stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, subject to complying with certain notice and other specified conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including giving Aetna the opportunity to propose changes to the Merger Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal or other circumstances. If Coventrys board of directors changes its recommendation that Coventrys stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, Aetna may terminate the Merger Agreement. In addition, Coventry may terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by Coventrys stockholders to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal.
 
 
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain other termination rights for each of Coventry and Aetna, including the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated by the end date of August 19, 2013, subject to each partys right to extend the end date for an additional three months if all closing conditions (other than receipt of antitrust and other specified regulatory approvals) have been satisfied by August 19, 2013. If requested by the other party, each party will consider in good faith agreeing (but will not be obligated to agree) to an additional extension of the end date.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) as a result of a change in the recommendation of Coventrys board of directors that Coventrys stockholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) as a result of the failure of Coventrys stockholders to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement upon a vote taken thereon after Coventrys board of directors has changed its recommendation, (iii) in connection with Coventrys entering into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal or (iv) in connection with Coventrys material breach of the provisions of the Merger Agreement relating to non-solicitation of alternative transactions, then Coventry would be required to pay Aetna a termination fee of $167.5 million. If the Merger Agreement is terminated because Coventrys stockholders have not approved and adopted the Merger Agreement upon a vote taken thereon and Coventrys board has not changed its recommendation, but a proposal for an alternative transaction was publicly announced and not withdrawn before the Coventry stockholder meeting, then Coventry would be required to pay Aetna 25% of the $167.5 million termination fee (with the remaining 75% payable to Aetna if Coventry enters into an agreement providing for, or consummates, an alternative transaction within 12 months of such termination).
In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) as a result of the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the end date (as it may be extended) due to the failure to achieve antitrust or other specified regulatory approvals, (ii) as a result of a final and non-appealable order or injunction relating to antitrust or other specified regulatory approvals or (iii) as a result of Aetnas failure to take appropriate proceedings to contest an order or injunction in respect of antitrust or other specified regulatory matters within certain specified time periods, then Aetna would be required to pay Coventry a termination fee of $450 million.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the Merger Agreement has been included to provide stockholders and other security holders with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any factual information about Aetna or Coventry. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement have been made solely for the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement; are not intended as statements of fact to be relied upon by Coventrys stockholders and other security holders, but rather as a way of allocating the risk between the parties in the event the statements therein prove to be inaccurate; have been modified or qualified by certain confidential disclosures that were made between the parties in connection with the negotiation of the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself; may no longer be true as of a given date; and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by
 
 
 
 
 
stockholders or other security holders. Security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement (except with respect to stockholders right to receive the Merger Consideration following the effective time of the Merger) and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Coventry Aetna or Merger Sub. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Aetnas or Coventrys public disclosures. Aetna acknowledges that, notwithstanding the inclusion of the foregoing cautionary statements, it is responsible for considering whether additional specific disclosures of material information regarding material contractual provisions are required to make the statements in this Form 8-K not misleading.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can generally identify forwardlooking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, explore, evaluate, intend, may, might, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, or will, or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Aetnas and Coventrys control.
-
Statements in this report regarding Aetna that are forward-looking, including Aetnas projections as to the anticipated benefits of the pending transaction to Aetna, increased membership as a result of the pending transaction, the impact of the pending transaction on Aetnas businesses and share of revenues from Government business, the methods Aetna will use to finance the cash portion of the transaction, the impact of the transaction on Aetnas operating earnings per share, the synergies from the pending transaction, and the closing date for the pending transaction, are based on managements estimates, assumptions and projections, and are subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetnas control. Important risk factors could cause actual future results and other future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including, but not limited to: the timing to consummate the proposed acquisition; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed acquisition may not be satisfied; the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed acquisition is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; Aetnas ability to achieve the synergies and value creation contemplated by the proposed acquisition; Aetnas ability to promptly and effectively integrate Coventrys businesses; the diversion of management time on acquisition-related issues; and the implementation of health care reform legislation and changes in Aetnas future cash requirements, capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Health care reform will significantly impact Aetnas business operations and financial results, including Aetnas medical benefit ratios. Components of the legislation will be phased in over the next six years, and Aetna will be required to dedicate material resources and incur material expenses during that time to implement health care reform. Many significant parts of the legislation, including health insurance exchanges, Medicaid expansion, the scope of essential benefits, employer penalties and the implementation of minimum medical loss ratios, require further guidance and clarification both at the federal level and/or in the form of regulations and actions by state legislatures to implement the law. In addition, pending efforts in the U.S. Congress to repeal, amend, or restrict funding for various aspects of health care reform, the 2012 presidential and congressional elections, and the possibility of additional litigation challenging aspects of the law continue to create additional uncertainty about the ultimate impact of health care reform. As a result, many of the impacts of health care reform will not be known for the next several years. Other important risk factors include: adverse and less predictable economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad (including unanticipated levels of, or increases in the rate of,
 
 
 
 
 
unemployment); adverse changes in health care reform and/or other federal or state government policies or regulations as a result of health care reform or otherwise (including legislative, judicial or regulatory measures that would affect Aetnas business model, restrict funding for or amend various aspects of health care reform, limit Aetnas ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs or profits in its pricing, such as mandated minimum medical benefit ratios, eliminate or reduce ERISA pre-emption of state laws (increasing Aetnas potential litigation exposure) or mandate coverage of certain health benefits); Aetnas ability to differentiate its products and solutions from those offered by its competitors, and demonstrate that its products lead to access to better quality of care by its members; unanticipated increases in medical costs (including increased intensity or medical utilization as a result of flu, increased COBRA participation rates or otherwise; changes in membership mix to higher cost or lower-premium products or membership-adverse selection; changes in medical cost estimates due to the necessary extensive judgment that is used in the medical cost estimation process, the considerable variability inherent in such estimates, and the sensitivity of such estimates to changes in medical claims payment patterns and changes in medical cost trends; increases resulting from unfavorable changes in contracting or re-contracting with providers, and increased pharmacy costs); failure to achieve and/or delays in achieving desired rate increases and/or profitable membership growth due to regulatory review or other regulatory restrictions, the difficult economy and/or significant competition, especially in key geographic areas where membership is concentrated, including successful protests of business awarded to us; adverse changes in size, product mix or medical cost experience of membership; Aetnas ability to diversify its sources of revenue and earnings; adverse program, pricing or funding actions by federal or state government payors, including curtailment or elimination of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services star rating bonus payments; the ability to reduce administrative expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating performance; the ability to successfully implement Aetnas agreement with CVS Caremark Corporation on a timely basis and in a cost-efficient manner and to achieve projected operating efficiencies for the agreement; Aetnas ability to integrate, simplify, and enhance its existing information technology systems and platforms to keep pace with changing customer and regulatory needs; the success of Aetnas health information technology initiatives; Aetnas ability to successfully integrate its businesses (including Medicity, Prodigy Health Group, PayFlex, and Genworth Financial Inc.s Medicare Supplement business and other businesses Aetna may acquire in the future, including Coventry) and implement multiple strategic and operational initiatives simultaneously; managing executive succession and key talent retention, recruitment and development; the outcome of various litigation and regulatory matters, including guaranty fund assessments and litigation concerning, and ongoing reviews by various regulatory authorities of, certain of Aetnas payment practices with respect to out-of-network providers and/or life insurance policies; reputational issues arising from its social media activities, data security breaches, other cybersecurity risks or other causes; the ability to develop and maintain relations with providers while taking actions to reduce medical costs and/or expand the services Aetna offers; Aetnas ability to maintain its relationships with third party brokers, consultants and agents who sell Aetnas products; increases in medical costs or Group Insurance claims resulting from any epidemics, acts of terrorism or other extreme events; and a downgrade in Aetnas financial ratings. For more discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect Aetna, please see the risk factors contained in Aetnas Annual Report and Aetnas Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 (Aetnas ) and Aetnas Second Quarter 10-Q

Quarterly Reports
Statements in this report regarding Coventry that are forward-looking, including but not limited to the anticipated benefits of the transaction to Coventry, the projected closing date, the closing of the transaction, and the projected membership additions to Aetna, are based on Coventrys managements estimates, assumptions and projections, and are subject to significant uncertainties and risks, many of which are beyond the control of Coventrys management, including but not limited to: the failure to receive, on a timely basis or otherwise, the required approvals by Coventrys stockholders and government or regulatory agencies; the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed transaction may not be satisfied; Coventrys and Aetnas ability to consummate the proposed transaction; the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies from the proposed transaction cannot be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; the failure by Aetna to obtain the necessary financing in connection with the proposed transaction; the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of Coventrys and Aetnas operations will be greater than expected; operating costs and business disruption may be greater than expected; the ability of Coventry to retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with providers or other business partners pending the consummation of the proposed transaction; and the implementation of health care reform legislation. Among the risk factors that may materially affect Coventrys business, operations or financial condition are the ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs; the ability to increase premiums to offset increases in the Coventrys health care costs; general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets; changes in legal requirements from recently enacted federal or state laws or regulations, court decisions, or government investigations or proceedings; guaranty fund assessments under state insurance guaranty association law; changes in government funding and various other risks associated with Coventrys participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs; Coventrys ability to effectively implement and manage its Kentucky Medicaid program, including the implementation of appropriate risk adjustment revenue and management of the associated medical cost and the effect on its MLR; a reduction in the number of members in its health plans; its ability to acquire additional managed care businesses and to successfully integrate acquired businesses into its operations; its ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain premium rates; the non-renewal or termination of its government contracts, unsuccessful bids for business with government agencies or renewal of government contracts on less than favorable terms; failure of independent agents and brokers to continue to market its products to employers; a failure to obtain cost-effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers that could result in higher medical costs and a decrease in membership; negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or Coventry in particular; a failure to effectively protect, maintain, and develop its information technology systems; compromises of its data security; periodic reviews, audits and investigations under its contracts with federal and state government agencies; litigation, including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories; volatility in its stock price and trading volume; Coventrys indebtedness, which imposes certain restrictions on its business and operations; an inability to generate sufficient cash to service its indebtedness; Coventrys
 
 
 
 
 
ability to receive cash from its regulated subsidiaries; and an impairment of Coventrys intangible assets. For a further discussion of risks and uncertainties, please see the risk factors described in Coventrys Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (), Coventrys Quarterly Report for the quarter ending March 31, 2012 (), and Coventrys Quarterly Report for the quarter ending June 30, 2012 (together with Coventrys First Quarter 10-Q, ), each on file with the SEC.

In the event that
any Commitment Party
becomes involved in any capacity in any action, proceeding or investigation brought by or against any person, including you, the Acquired Business or any of your or its equityholders, affiliates or creditors, in connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter (together, the 
Letters
), you agree to periodically reimburse such Commitment Party for its reasonable out-of-pocket legal and other out-of-pocket expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith.  You also agree to indemnify and hold each Indemnified Person (as defined below) harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities to any person, including you, the Acquired Business or any of your or its equityholders or affiliates, arising out of any investigation, litigation, claim or proceeding in connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Letters
(whether or not such investigation, litigation, claim or proceeding is brought by you, the Acquired Business or any of your or its equityholders, affiliates or creditors or any Indemnified Person and whether or not any Indemnified Person is otherwise a party thereto)
, except to the extent that (and only for so long as) such loss, claim, damage or liability has been found by a judgment of the highest court of competent jurisdiction to have considered such matter to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person (or any of its controlling persons or subsidiaries of controlling persons or any of their or such Indemnified Persons partners, members, directors, agents, employees or controlling persons) in performing the services that are the subject of the Letters, or the material breach of the material agreements of such Indemnified Person set forth in one or both of the Letters.  If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient to hold it harmless, then you will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (a) the relative economic interests of (i) you, the Acquired Business and your and its equityholders and affiliates, on the one hand, and (ii) such Indemnified Person, on the other, in the matters contemplated by the Letters, and (b) if and to the extent the allocation provided for in the immediately preceding clause (a) is for any reason held to be unenforceable, the relative fault of (1) you, the Acquired Business and your and its equityholders and affiliates, on the one hand, and (2) such Indemnified Person, on the other, with respect to such loss, claim, damage or liability and any other relevant equitable considerations.  Your reimbursement, indemnity and contribution obligations under this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation that you may otherwise have, shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to each affiliate of each Commitment Party and the partners, members, directors, agents, employees and controlling persons and subsidiaries of such controlling persons, as the case may be, of such Commitment Party and each such affiliate,
and will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of you, such Commitment Party, each such affiliate and any such person (collectively, the 
Indemnified Persons
).  You also agree that none of the Indemnified Persons will have
any liability to you or any person asserting claims on behalf of or in right of you in connection with or as a result of either this arrangement or any matter referred to in the Letters, except, in the case of any such liability to you, solely to the extent that (and only for so long as) any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses incurred by you have been found by a judgment the highest court of competent jurisdiction to have considered such matter to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person (or any of its controlling persons or subsidiaries of controlling persons or any of their or such Indemnified Persons partners, members, directors, agents, employees or controlling persons) in performing the services that are the subject of the Letters, or the material breach of the material agreements of such Indemnified Person set forth in the Letters;
provided
that in no event will you or any Indemnified Person have any liability for any indirect, consequential, special or punitive damages in connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Letters (it being agreed, however, that your indemnity and contribution obligations, as set forth in the preceding provisions of this Annex A, will apply in respect of any indirect, consequential, special or punitive
 
 
 
 
 
damages that may be awarded against any Indemnified Person).  
The provisions of this Annex A will survive any termination or completion of the arrangement provided by the Letters.
provided,
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Borrowers obligation to reimburse legal expenses shall, in connection with any one action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar actions or proceedings arising out of the same general allegations, be limited to the fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for all Indemnified Persons (and, if reasonably necessary, one local counsel plus one specialist counsel in, respectively, any relevant jurisdiction or applicable specialty), which, if the Arrangers or their affiliates shall be parties or potential parties to any such action or proceeding, shall be selected by the Arrangers, and, solely in the case of an actual or potential conflict of interest affecting any Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons, of one additional counsel (and if reasonably necessary, one local counsel plus one specialist counsel in, respectively, any relevant jurisdiction or applicable specialty) for the affected Indemnified Person or Indemnified Persons and (y) to the extent that it is found by a judgment of the highest court of competent jurisdiction to have considered such matter that an Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification because such loss, claim, damage or liability resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person (or any of its controlling persons or subsidiaries of controlling persons or any of their or such Indemnified Persons partners, members, directors, agents, employees or controlling persons) in performing the services that are the subject of the Letters, or the material breach of the material agreements of such Indemnified Person set forth in one or both of the Letters, then such Indemnified Person will refund to the Borrower any portion of the reimbursed amounts that is attributable to expenses incurred in relation to the act or omission of such Indemnified Person which is the subject of such finding;
that any amount so refunded shall be returned by the Borrower if such finding is overturned by a higher court.

I, [_____________], solely in my capacity as the duly appointed and acting Chief Financial Officer of the Borrower, and not individually, DO HEREBY CERTIFY to the Lenders, as follows:

2.    Immediately after giving effect to the Acquisition on the Closing Date:
a.     the fair value of the property of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis;
b.     the present fair saleable value of the assets of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of the Borrower and its subsidiaries on their debts, on a consolidated basis, as they become absolute and matured;
c.     the capital of the Borrower and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not unreasonably small in relation to their collective businesses, taken as a whole, as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted immediately following the Closing Date; and
d.     the Borrower and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to incur, or believe that they will incur on or immediately following the Closing Date, debts, including current obligations, beyond their ability to pay such debts as they become absolute and matured.
For the purposes of this Certificate, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.  For the purpose of this Certificate, it is assumed that the indebtedness and the other obligations incurred under and in connection with the Facility will come due at maturity.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand as of the date first written above.
