Incremental Commitment
Amended Credit Agreement
The First Amendment provides Aetna the option to expand the lenders aggregate commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement by up to $1.0 billion, to a maximum aggregate commitment of $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions precedent.  Pursuant to the Incremental Commitment, Aetna exercised its option to expand the lenders aggregate commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement by $500 million, to a maximum aggregate amount of revolving loans and letters of credit outstanding of $2.0 billion.  Accordingly, Aetna now has the option to expand the lenders aggregate commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement in the future by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions precedent.
Entry into Bridge Credit Agreement
On September 24, 2012, Aetna entered into a 364-day bridge credit agreement (the ).  Under the Bridge Credit Agreement, Goldman Sachs Bank USA () is the administrative agent. In addition to Goldman, twelve other lenders are party to the Bridge Credit Agreement.  The maximum aggregate loan commitment of any single lender under the Bridge Credit Agreement is $400 million.  Goldman, Sachs & Co., an affiliate of Goldman, and UBS Securities LLC, a party to the Bridge Credit Agreement, also are serving as financial advisors to Aetna in connection with its proposed acquisition (the ) of Coventry Health Care, Inc. ().

Proposed Acquisition
Coventry
Under the Bridge Credit Agreement, Aetna may borrow on an unsecured basis an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.0 billion
to the extent Aetna has not received $2.0 billion in net cash proceeds from issuing its senior notes or from certain other transactions on or prior to the Closing Date (as defined below).
Any proceeds of the Bridge Credit Agreement are required to be used to fund the Proposed Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Proposed Acquisition. Any borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement mature 364 days after the closing of the Proposed Acquisition (the ).
Closing Date
Amounts outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Aetnas option, either (a) at the London Interbank Offered Rate (); or (b) at the base rate (defined as the highest of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% per annum), plus, in each case, the applicable LIBOR margin or base rate margin depending upon the ratings of long-term indebtedness of Aetna.  The minimum and maximum LIBOR margins are 1.00% and 1.75% per annum, respectively, and the minimum and maximum base rate margins are 0% and 0.75% per annum, respectively, provided, however, that the applicable margins will increase by 0.25% per annum on the 90th day following the and by an additional 0.25% per annum each 90th day thereafter while loans remain outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement.  Aetna will also pay to each lender on each of the following dates a duration fee equal to the following applicable percentages of the aggregate principal amount of such lenders loans outstanding on such date: (i) 90 days after the Closing Date, 0.50%; (ii) 180 days after the Closing Date, 1.00%; and (iii) 270 days after the Closing Date, 1.50%. Aetna will also pay the lenders certain other fees.

Closing Date
The lenders' undrawn commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement will be automatically and permanently reduced in an amount equal to, and Aetna also will be required to make prepayments of any outstanding loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement with, the (i) net cash proceeds from the issuance of debt of Aetna or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) net cash proceeds from the issuance of equity of Aetna and (iii) net cash proceeds in excess of $300 million received by Aetna or any of its subsidiaries from non-ordinary course asset sales, in each case subject to certain exceptions.  
The Bridge Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate payment of the full amounts outstanding.  Additionally, the Bridge Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and negative covenants. The Bridge Credit Agreement events of default, respresentations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covernants are substantially the same as those under the Existing Credit Agreement. The Bridge Credit Agreement also contains a covenant limiting Restricted Payments (as defined in the Bridge Credit Agreement) by Aetna, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, including an exception permitting the payment of regular cash dividends.
The funding of the Bridge Credit Agreement is subject to various conditions precedent including:  (i) the consummation of the Proposed Acquisition; (ii) the absence of any Acquired Business Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Bridge Credit Agreement); (iii) the accuracy on and as of the Closing Date of certain representations and warranties related to both Aetna and Coventry; (iv) termination of Coventrys existing credit agreement dated as of June 22, 2011;
(v) Aetna having used commercially reasonable efforts to cause a senior notes issuance to occur prior to the Closing Date; 
and (vi) other customary closing conditions each as more fully described in the Bridge Credit Agreement.
In the ordinary course of their respective businesses, the various agents and certain lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement and the Bridge Credit Agreement and their affiliates have performed, perform and may in the future perform, normal commercial banking, investment banking and/or advisory services for Aetna and its affiliates from time to time for which they have received, or will receive, customary fees and expenses.

Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Group of Loans (subject in each case to the provisions of Article VIII), as follows:
Method of Electing Interest Rates
 
(i)
 
if such Loans are Base Rate Loans, the Borrower may elect to convert such Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day; and
 
(ii)
 
if such Loans are Euro-Dollar Loans, the Borrower may (x) elect to convert such Euro-Dollar Loans to Base Rate Loans as of any Domestic Business Day, (y) elect to convert such Euro-Dollar Loans to Euro-Dollar Loans with an Interest Period different from the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day or (z) elect to continue such Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period beginning on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans;
 
that, if the Borrower elects to convert any Euro-Dollar Loans to Base Rate Loans or to Euro-Dollar Loans with a different Interest Period, as of any day other than the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loans, the Borrower shall reimburse each Lender in accordance with Section 2.12.
provided
 
Each such election shall be made by delivering a notice (a ) to the Agent (i) at least one Domestic Business Day before such notice is to be effective if the relevant Loans are to be converted into Base Rate Loans or (ii) at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days before such conversion or continuation is to be effective if such Loans are to be converted into, or continued as, Euro-Dollar Loans.
Notice of Interest Rate Election
 
A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Group of Loans; that (i) such portion is allocated ratably among the Loans comprising such Group and (ii) the portion to which such Notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each $15,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000.
provided
 
 
 
23
 
 
 
(b)
 
Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:
 
(i)
 
the Group of Loans (or portion thereof) to which such notice applies;
 
(ii)
 
the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the applicable clause of Section 2.09(a);
 
(iii)
 
whether such Group of Loans (or portion thereof) is to be converted to Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans or continued as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional Interest Period; and
 
(iv)
 
if such Loans (or portions thereof) are to be converted to or continued as Euro-Dollar Loans, the duration of the Interest Period to be applicable thereto immediately after such conversion or continuation.
 
Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.
 
(c)
 
Upon receipt of a Notice of Interest Rate Election from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.09(a), the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents thereof and such notice shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.  If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Notice of Interest Rate Election to the Agent for any Euro-Dollar Loans, such Loans shall be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default under clause (g) or (h) of Section 6.01 has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Borrower, or if any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, has notified the Borrower of the election to give effect to this sentence on account of such other Event of Default, then, in each such case, so long as such Event of Default is continuing, no Loans may be converted to or continued as Euro-Dollar Loans.
 
SECTION 2.10.

Each such optional prepayment shall be applied to prepay ratably the relevant Loans of the several Lenders.  Prepayment of a Euro-Dollar Loan on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto shall be subject to Section 2.12.
Prepayments
 
(b)
 
In the event and on each occasion that, after the making of the Loans hereunder on the Closing Date (or prior thereto if any required reduction of the Commitments shall be deferred pursuant to the first proviso in Section 2.06(d)), any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Commitment Reduction/Prepayment Event, (i) the Borrower shall, on the date of
 
 
 
24
 
 
 
such receipt, deliver to the Agent a notice thereof setting forth the nature of such Commitment Reduction/Prepayment Event and the amount of such Net Proceeds (together with a reasonably detailed calculation thereof) and (ii) within three Domestic Business Days after such Net Proceeds are received, the Borrower shall prepay Loans in an amount equal to such Net Proceeds (or, if less, the aggregate amount of the Loans then outstanding); that in the case of any Commitment Reduction/Prepayment Event described in clause (c) of the definition of such term, (x) such prepayment shall only be required in an amount equal to the amount by which the Net Proceeds of all Commitment Reduction/Prepayment Events described in such clause (c) occurring since August 19, 2012, exceeds $300,000,000 and (y) if the Borrower shall, in such notice to the Agent, state that the Borrower intends to cause such Net Proceeds from such Commitment Reduction/Prepayment Event (or a portion thereof specified in such notice) to be applied, or committed to be applied, within 180 days after receipt of such Net Proceeds to acquire, construct, improve, upgrade or repair assets (other than cash or cash equivalents) to be used in the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, or to consummate any business acquisition by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, then the amount of the prepayment required to be made under this Section 2.10(b) on account of such Commitment Reduction/Prepayment Event shall be reduced by the amount of the Net Proceeds specified by the Borrower in such notice as intended to be so reinvested; , that if any such Net Proceeds have not been so applied, or committed to be applied under one or more legally binding agreements, by the end of such 180-day period, or if such Net Proceeds shall have been so committed to be applied by the end of such 180-day period but shall not have been so applied within 270 days after they shall have been received (except for the application of Net Proceeds so committed to be applied that arise from any casualty, condemnation or similar event or any related insurance, which shall not be subject to such 270-day period), then, not later than the last day of such 180-day period (or such 270-day period, as the case may be), the Borrower shall provide to the Agent written notice thereof and on the first Domestic Business Day following the end of such 180-day (or 270-day) period, the Borrower shall prepay Loans in an amount equal to such Net Proceeds that have not been so applied  (or, if less, the aggregate amount of the Loans then outstanding).

The Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share of each such payment received by the Agent for the account of the Lenders.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, any Base Rate Loans or fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day.  Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day, the date for
General Provisions as to Payments

payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another calendar month or falls after the Maturity Date, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day.  If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.
 
(b)
 
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
 
(c)
 
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.11(c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.11(c) shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.12.
 
.  If the Borrower makes any payment of principal with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan or any Euro-Dollar Loan is converted to a Base Rate Loan (pursuant to Section 2.09, Section 2.10, Article VI or Article VIII) on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto or the end of an applicable period fixed pursuant to Section 2.07(c), or if any Lender assigns any Euro-Dollar Loan as required by Section 8.06 on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, or if the Borrower fails to borrow or prepay any Euro-Dollar Loan after notice has been given to any Lender in accordance with Section 2.03(a) or Section 2.10, the Borrower shall reimburse each Lender within 15 days after demand for
Funding Losses

Computation of Interest and Fees
 
SECTION 2.14.
 
.  For each day for which a Lender is required to maintain reserves in respect of either (x)  (as defined in all regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or (y) any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Euro-Dollar Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Lender to United States residents, such Lender may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans, additional interest on the related Euro-Dollar Loan of such Lender at a rate per annum determined by such Lender up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B) one the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate.  Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Euro-Dollar Loans of such Lender shall be payable to such Lender at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar Loans of the amount then due to such Lender under this Section.  Such Lenders notice to the Borrower shall set forth its calculation of such additional interest and such calculation shall be conclusive if made reasonably and in good faith.

Before giving any notice to the Agent pursuant to this Section 8.02, such Lender shall designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.  If such notice is given, all Euro-Dollar Loans of such Lender then outstanding shall be converted to Base Rate Loans either (a) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Euro-Dollar Loans if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loans to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loans to such day.

Such Lenders notice to the Borrower and the Agent shall set forth an explanation of the foregoing in reasonable detail.

If any Lender shall have determined that any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or liquidity, or any change in any such law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, made or adopted after the date hereof has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders capital or on the capital of such Lenders holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Loans held by, such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lenders holding company could otherwise have achieved (taking into consideration such Lenders policies and the policies of such Lenders holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), and the amount of such reduction is reasonably determined by such Lender to be material, then within 15 days of the Borrowers receipt of written demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction in return.

           Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof (other than any event deemed to have occurred after the date hereof solely as a result of Section 8.03(c)), which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 8.03 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or expenses incurred or reductions suffered as a result of any change in law more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the change in law giving rise to such increased costs or expenses or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the change in law giving rise to any such increased costs or expenses or reductions is retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  A certificate of any Lender claiming compensation under Section 8.03(a) or 8.03(b) and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and describing the method of calculation thereof shall be conclusive if made reasonably and in good faith.  In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.03, (i) no Lender shall be entitled to request compensation under this Section 8.03 for any costs imposed on such Lender under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or Basel III or any taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings unless it shall be the general policy of such Lender to seek compensation under comparable credit facilities with documentation under which it is entitled to such compensation, and (ii) no Lender shall be entitled to request compensation under this Section 8.03 in excess of the amount determined by it in good faith to represent the actual net cost, reduction in amounts received or reduction in return on capital referred to in Section 8.03(a) or 8.03(b), as the case may be, taking into account any tax or other benefits received by it in connection with such cost or reduction.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.05(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.05(e).

Exhibit 99.5
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and for the six months ended June 30, 2012, combine the historical consolidated statements of income of Aetna and Coventry, giving effect to the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Aetna (which is referred to as Merger Sub) with and into Coventry (which is referred to as the merger) as if it had occurred on January 1, 2011. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2012, combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of Aetna and Coventry, giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred on June 30, 2012. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was based on and should be read in conjunction with the following historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes:
 
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared by Aetna using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The acquisition accounting is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. The proposed merger has not yet received the necessary approvals from governmental authorities, and under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (which is referred to as the HSR Act) and other relevant laws and regulations, before completion of the merger, there are significant limitations regarding what Aetna can learn about Coventry. The assets and liabilities of Coventry have been measured based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that Aetna believes are reasonable based on information that is currently available. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur, and those differences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the combined company's future results of operations and financial position. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Aetna intends to commence the necessary valuation and other studies required to complete the acquisition accounting promptly upon completion of the merger and will finalize the acquisition accounting as soon as practicable within the required measurement period in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standards Codification (which is referred to as ASC) 805, but in no event later than one year following completion of the merger.
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to represent the actual results of operations that Aetna and Coventry would have achieved had the companies been combined during these periods and is not intended to project the future results of operations that the combined company may achieve after the merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the realization of any cost savings following completion of the merger and also does not reflect any related restructuring and integration charges to achieve those cost savings. Material intercompany transactions between Aetna and Coventry during the periods presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been eliminated (refer to and ).

On August 19, 2012, Aetna, Merger Sub and Coventry entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (which is referred to as the merger agreement), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Coventry will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Aetna. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Coventry common stock issued and outstanding will be converted into the right to receive $27.30 in cash, without interest, and 0.3885 of an Aetna common share.
At completion of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Coventry common stock outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, with a per share exercise price less than the sum of (a) $27.30 and (b) the product of (i) the Aetna closing price multiplied by 0.3885 (which sum is referred to as the equity award cash consideration and which options are referred to as in-the-money options), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (x) the excess of (i) the equity award cash consideration over (ii) the applicable per share exercise price of that in-the-money option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Coventry common stock underlying that in-the-money option. The average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices for Aetna common shares on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the five trading days ending on the trading day that is two trading days prior to the completion of the merger is referred to as the Aetna closing price.
During the 60-day period following the date of the merger agreement, Aetna, in consultation with Coventry, will consider the appropriate treatment of each option to purchase shares of Coventry common stock outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, with a per share exercise price equal to or greater than the equity award cash consideration (which options are referred to as underwriter options), taking into account the appropriate terms and conditions of each such underwater option.
At completion of the merger, each outstanding restricted share of Coventry common stock (which represents a share of Coventry common stock subject to vesting and forfeiture restrictions) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration payable to holders of shares of Coventry common stock, less applicable withholding taxes.
At completion of the merger, each Coventry performance share unit and restricted stock unit outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan (which are collectively referred to as Coventry stock units) that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of the merger agreement, is vested or becomes vested upon completion of the merger (and each Coventry stock unit held by Allen F. Wise), which are collectively referred to as cashed-out units, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (a) the equity award cash consideration multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Coventry common stock underlying that cashed-out unit.
At completion of the merger, each Coventry stock unit outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of the merger agreement, is not vested and will not become vested upon completion of the merger (other than the Coventry stock units held by Mr. Wise), which are referred to as rollover units, will be converted into a cash-settled Aetna restricted stock unit with the number of Aetna common shares underlying that cash-settled Aetna restricted stock unit equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Coventry common stock underlying that rollover unit immediately prior to completion of the merger multiplied by (y) the quotient of (i) the equity award cash consideration divided by (ii) the Aetna closing price. Each such cash-settled Aetna restricted stock unit will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including service-based vesting) as applied to the corresponding rollover unit immediately prior to completion of the merger.
The merger is subject to adoption of the merger agreement by Coventry stockholders, early termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the required governmental authorizations having been obtained and being in full force and effect and other usual and customary conditions to completion. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the merger is expected to be completed in mid-2013.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial statements of Aetna and Coventry. The acquisition method of accounting is based on ASC 805 and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, .
Fair Value Measurements
 
 
ASC 805 requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, ASC 805 requires that the consideration transferred be measured at the date the merger is completed at the then-current market price. This requirement will likely result in a per share equity component that is different from the amount assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
ASC 820 defines the term "fair value" and sets forth the valuation requirements for any asset or liability measured at fair value, expands related disclosure requirements and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined in ASC 820 as "the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date." This is an exit price concept for the valuation of the asset or liability. In addition, market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers in the principal (or the most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for an asset assume the highest and best use by these market participants. As a result of these standards, Aetna may be required to record the fair value of assets which are not intended to be used or sold and/or to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect Aetna's intended use of those assets. Many of these fair value measurements can be highly subjective, and it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded, as of completion of the merger, primarily at their respective fair values and added to those of Aetna. Financial statements and reported results of operations of Aetna issued after completion of the merger will reflect these values, but will not be retroactively restated to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Coventry.
Under ASC 805, acquisition-related transaction costs (e.g., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. Total acquisition-related transaction costs expected to be incurred by Aetna and Coventry are estimated to be approximately $120 million and $45 million, respectively, of which none had been incurred as of June 30, 2012. Acquisition-related transaction costs expected to be incurred by Aetna include estimated fees related to a bridge financing commitment and agreement and estimated interest costs associated with the expected issuance of long-term transaction-related debt in the fourth quarter of 2012. Those costs are reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as an increase to accrued expenses and other current liabilities, with the related tax benefits reflected as an increase in other current assets and the after tax impact presented as a decrease to retained earnings.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect the projected realization of cost savings following completion of the merger. These cost savings opportunities are from administrative cost savings, as well as network and medical management savings. Although Aetna projects that cost savings will result from the merger, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect projected pretax restructuring and integration charges associated with the projected cost savings, which are projected to be approximately $250 million to $300 million over a period of three years following completion of the merger. Such restructuring and integration charges will be expensed in the appropriate accounting periods after completion of the merger.
 
At completion of the merger, Aetna will review Coventry's accounting policies. As a result of that review, Aetna may identify differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the combined financial statements. At this time, Aetna is not aware of any differences that would have a material impact on the combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements assume there are no differences in accounting policies.

The following is a preliminary estimate of the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed by Aetna in the merger, reconciled to the estimate of total consideration expected to be transferred:
 
 
The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is determined primarily using variations of the "income approach," which is based on the present value of the future after tax cash flows attributable to each identified intangible asset. Other valuation methods, including the market approach and cost approach, were also considered in estimating the fair value. Under the HSR Act and other relevant laws and regulations, there are significant limitations on Aetna's ability to obtain specific information about the Coventry intangible assets prior to completion of the merger.
At this time, Aetna does not have sufficient information as to the amount, timing and risk of cash flows of all of Coventry's identifiable intangible assets to determine their fair value. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset values, from the perspective of a market participant, include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue and profitability); the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset. However, for purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and using publicly available
 
 
information, such as historical revenues, Coventry's cost structure, industry information for comparable intangible assets and certain other high-level assumptions, the fair value of Coventry's identifiable intangible assets and their weighted-average useful lives have been estimated as follows:
 
These preliminary estimates of fair value and weighted-average useful life will likely be different from the final acquisition accounting, and the difference could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Once Aetna has full access to information about Coventry's intangible assets, additional insight will be gained that could impact (i) the estimated total value assigned to intangible assets, (ii) the estimated allocation of value between finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and/or (iii) the estimated weighted-average useful life of each category of intangible assets. The estimated intangible asset values and their useful lives could be impacted by a variety of factors that may become known to Aetna only upon access to additional information and/or by changes in such factors that may occur prior to completion of the merger. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory, legislative, legal, technological and competitive environments. Increased knowledge about these and/or other elements could result in a change to the estimated fair value of the identifiable Coventry intangible assets and/or to the estimated weighted-average useful lives from what Aetna has assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The combined effect of any such changes could then also result in a significant increase or decrease to Aetna's estimate of associated amortization expense.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aetna and Coventry each have a Missouri Medicaid business. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information assumes Aetna will dispose of its Missouri Medicaid business at the time of the merger and continue to operate Coventry's Missouri Medicaid business. Specifically, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income reflect the elimination of the revenues associated with Aetna's Missouri Medicaid business as well as elimination of the costs specifically identifiable with that revenue. Aetna does not currently have market participant bids or other information regarding similar transactions that may be indicative of the fair value of the Missouri Medicaid business. As a result, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects the disposal of Aetna's Missouri Medicaid business assuming that the book value of that business approximates fair value, and also assumes cash consideration received equal to book value.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not present a combined dividend per share amount. On both April 27, 2012 and July 27, 2012, Aetna paid dividends of $0.175 per Aetna common share. On both April 9, 2012 and July 9, 2012, Coventry paid dividends of $0.125 per share of Coventry common stock. In addition, on August 27, 2012, Coventry declared a dividend of $0.125, which will be paid on October 8, 2012, and is not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Coventry is not permitted to declare, set aside or pay a dividend or other distribution other than its regular quarterly cash dividend in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, in an amount not in excess of $0.125 per share of Coventry common stock prior to completion of the merger, and any future payment of Coventry's quarterly dividend is subject to future approval and declaration by the Coventry board of directors. Prior to completion of the merger, Aetna is not permitted to declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution other than its regular cash dividend in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The dividend policy of Aetna following completion of the merger will be determined by the Aetna board of directors following completion of the merger.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect the projected realization of cost savings following completion of the merger. These cost savings opportunities are from administrative cost savings, as well as network and medical management savings. Although Aetna management projects that cost savings will result from the merger, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved.
