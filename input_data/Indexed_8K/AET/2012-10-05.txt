Item 8.01 Other Events.
As part of its continuing cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and in order to provide the DOJ with additional time for review, Aetna Inc. (Aetna) will re-file its premerger notification with the DOJ and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the HSR Act) in connection with its proposed acquisition of Coventry Health Care, Inc. (Coventry).  The notification will be re-filed on or before October 10, 2012, and will initiate a new waiting period under the HSR Act that will expire 30 days later, unless extended by a request for further information or terminated earlier.
Aetna has filed all material applications required for state regulatory approval of the acquisition of Coventry and continues to project that the transaction will be completed in mid-2013.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can generally identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, explore, evaluate, intend, may, might, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, or will, or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Aetna's and Coventry's control.
Statements in this document that are forward-looking, including Aetna's projections as to the timing of the re-filing of its premerger notification and the projected date the proposed transaction will be completed, are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections, and are subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Aetna's and Coventry's control. Important risk factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from those currently expected by Aetna's management, including, but not limited to: the risk that a condition to closing of the proposed acquisition may not be satisfied, the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the proposed acquisition is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated and the outcome of various litigation matters related to the proposed acquisition.
No assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do occur, when they will occur and what impact they will have on the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of Aetna or Coventry. Neither Aetna nor Coventry assumes any duty to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, as of any future date.
