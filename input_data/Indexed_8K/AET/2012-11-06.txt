Exhibit 99.1
AETNA AND COVENTRY
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2011, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, combine the historical consolidated statements of income of Aetna Inc. ("Aetna") and Coventry Health Care, Inc. ("Coventry"), giving effect to the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Aetna ("Merger Sub") with and into Coventry (which is referred to as the merger) as if it had occurred on the first day of each period presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2012, combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of Aetna and Coventry, giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred on September 30, 2012. The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was based on and should be read in conjunction with, the following historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes:
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared by Aetna using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Aetna has been treated as the acquirer in the merger for accounting purposes. The acquisition accounting is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. The proposed merger has not yet received the necessary approvals from governmental authorities, and under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (which is referred to as the HSR Act) and other relevant laws and regulations, before completion of the merger, there are significant limitations regarding what Aetna can learn about Coventry. The assets and liabilities of Coventry have been measured based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that Aetna believes are reasonable based on information that is currently available. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur, and those differences could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the combined companys future results of operations and financial position. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Aetna intends to commence the necessary valuation and other studies required to complete the acquisition accounting promptly upon completion of the merger and will finalize the acquisition accounting as soon as practicable within the required measurement period in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (which is referred to as ASC) 805,
Business Combinations
, but in no event later than one year following completion of the merger.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been presented for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to represent the actual results of operations that Aetna and Coventry would have achieved had the companies been combined during these periods and is not intended to project the future results of operations that the combined company may achieve after the merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the realization of any cost savings following completion of the merger and also does not reflect any related restructuring and integration charges to achieve those cost savings. Material intercompany transactions between Aetna and Coventry during the periods presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been eliminated (refer to

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On August 19, 2012, Aetna, Merger Sub and Coventry entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (which, as amended, is referred to as the merger agreement), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Coventry will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Aetna. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Coventry common stock issued and outstanding will be converted into the right to receive $27.30 in cash, without interest, and 0.3885 of an Aetna common share.
At completion of the merger, each option to purchase shares of Coventry common stock outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, with a per share exercise price less than the sum of (a) $27.30 and (b) the product of the Aetna closing price multiplied by 0.3885 (which sum is referred to as the equity award cash consideration and which options are referred to as in-the-money options), will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (x) the excess of (i) the equity award cash consideration over (ii) the applicable per share exercise price of that in-the-money option multiplied by (y) the total number of shares of Coventry common stock underlying that in-the-money option. The average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices for Aetna common shares on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the five trading days ending on the trading day that is two trading days prior to the completion of the merger is referred to as the Aetna closing price.
During the 60-day period following the date of the merger agreement, Aetna and Coventry discussed the treatment of each option to purchase shares of Coventry common stock outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan, whether or not vested or exercisable, with a per share exercise price greater than or equal to the equity award cash consideration (which options are referred to as underwater options), taking into account the appropriate terms and conditions of each such underwater option and decided to cancel such underwater options upon completion of the merger. Aetna has agreed to pay the holders of underwater options that execute customary acknowledgments and waivers an amount in cash calculated by reference to the exercise price of the underwater options and equivalent to $1.00 to $4.00 for each share of Coventry common stock subject to an underwater option. For active employees of Coventry, such payment will also be conditioned upon such employee remaining employed by the surviving corporation or Aetna for one year following the closing of the merger (subject to acceleration upon certain terminations of employment).
At completion of the merger, each outstanding restricted share of Coventry common stock (which represents a share of Coventry common stock subject to vesting and forfeiture restrictions) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration payable to holders of shares of Coventry common stock, less applicable withholding taxes.
At completion of the merger, each Coventry performance share unit and restricted stock unit outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan (which are collectively referred to as Coventry stock units) that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of the merger agreement, is vested or becomes vested upon completion of the merger and each Coventry stock unit held by Allen F. Wise, which are collectively referred to as cashed-out units, will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (a) the equity award cash consideration multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Coventry common stock underlying that cashed-out unit.
At completion of the merger, each Coventry stock unit outstanding under any Coventry employee benefit plan that, pursuant to its terms as of the date of the merger agreement, is not vested and will not become vested upon completion of the merger (other than the Coventry stock units held by Mr. Wise), which are referred to as rollover units, will be converted into a cash-settled Aetna restricted stock unit with the number of Aetna common shares underlying that cash-settled Aetna restricted stock unit equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Coventry common stock underlying that rollover unit immediately prior to completion of the merger multiplied by (y) the quotient of (i) the equity award cash consideration divided by (ii) the Aetna closing price. Each such cash-settled
Page

Aetna restricted stock unit will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including service-based vesting) as applied to the corresponding rollover unit immediately prior to completion of the merger.
The merger is subject to adoption of the merger agreement by Coventry stockholders, early termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the required governmental authorizations having been obtained and being in full force and effect and other usual and customary conditions to completion. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the merger is expected to be completed in mid-2013.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial statements of Aetna and Coventry. The acquisition method of accounting is based on ASC 805 and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurements
.
ASC 805 requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, ASC 805 requires that the consideration transferred be measured at the date the merger is completed at the then-current market price. This requirement will likely result in a per share equity component that is different from the amount assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
ASC 820 defines the term fair value and sets forth the valuation requirements for any asset or liability measured at fair value, expands related disclosure requirements and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures. Fair value is defined in ASC 820 as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This is an exit price concept for the valuation of the asset or liability. In addition, market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers in the principal (or the most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for an asset assume the highest and best use by these market participants. As a result of these standards, Aetna may be required to record the fair value of assets which are not intended to be used or sold and/or to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect Aetnas intended use of those assets. Many of these fair value measurements can be highly subjective, and it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded, as of completion of the merger, primarily at their respective fair values and added to those of Aetna. Financial statements and reported results of operations of Aetna issued after completion of the merger will reflect these values, but will not be retroactively restated to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Coventry.
Under ASC 805, acquisition-related transaction costs (e.g., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. Acquisition-related transaction costs expected to be incurred by Aetna include estimated fees related to a bridge financing commitment and agreement and estimated interest costs associated with the issuance of long-term transaction-related debt that Aetna agreed to issue on November 2, 2012. Total acquisition-related transaction costs expected to be incurred by Aetna and Coventry are estimated to be approximately $120 million and $37 million, respectively, of which $13.8 million and $6.5 million, respectively, has been incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2012.
Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 are reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for that same period as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses because those costs are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2012 is required to include adjustments which give effect to events that are directly attributable to the transaction regardless of whether they are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results or are non-recurring.
Page
7
Therefore, acquisition-related transaction costs expected to be incurred by Aetna and Coventry subsequent to September 30, 2012 of $106.2 million and $30.6 million, respectively, are reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2012 as an increase to accrued expenses and other current liabilities, with the related tax benefits reflected as an increase in other current assets and the after tax impact presented as a decrease to retained earnings.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect the projected realization of cost savings following completion of the merger. These cost savings opportunities are from administrative cost savings, as well as network and medical management savings. Although Aetna projects that cost savings will result from the merger, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect projected pretax restructuring and integration charges associated with the projected cost savings, which are projected to be approximately $250 million to $300 million over a period of three years following completion of the merger. Such restructuring and integration charges will be expensed in the appropriate accounting periods after completion of the merger.
At completion of the merger, Aetna will review Coventrys accounting policies. As a result of that review, Aetna may identify differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the combined financial statements. At this time, Aetna is not aware of any differences that would have a material impact on the combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements assume there are no differences in accounting policies.
The following is a preliminary estimate of consideration expected to be transferred to effect the acquisition of Coventry:

Certain amounts may reflect rounding adjustments
(a) Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement between Coventry and Allen F. Wise, dated April 30, 2009, as amended on June 16, 2010 and January 31, 2012, on January 1, 2013. Mr. Wise is entitled to receive Coventry stock units with a grant date fair value of $7,600,000, which is referred to as the Wise 2013 Grant. The Wise 2013 Grant is not reflected in the table above.
The following is a preliminary estimate of the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed by Aetna in the merger, reconciled to the estimate of total consideration expected to be transferred:
Page

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is determined primarily using variations of the income approach, which is based on the present value of the future after tax cash flows attributable to each identified intangible asset. Other valuation methods, including the market approach and cost approach, were also considered in estimating the fair value. Under the HSR Act and other relevant laws and regulations, there are significant limitations on Aetna's ability to obtain specific information about the Coventry intangible assets prior to completion of the merger.
At this time, Aetna does not have sufficient information as to the amount, timing and risk of cash flows of all of Coventry's identifiable intangible assets to determine their fair value. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset values, from the perspective of a market participant, include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue and profitability); the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment of the assets life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset. However, for purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and using publicly available information, such as historical revenues, Coventrys cost structure, industry information for comparable intangible assets and certain other high-level assumptions, the fair value of Coventry's identifiable intangible assets and their weighted-average useful lives have been estimated as follows:
These preliminary estimates of fair value and weighted-average useful life will likely be different from the final acquisition accounting, and the difference could have a material impact on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Once Aetna has full access to information about Coventry's intangible assets, additional insight will be gained that could impact (i) the estimated total value assigned to intangible assets, (ii) the estimated allocation of value between finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and/or (iii) the estimated weighted-average useful life of each category of intangible assets. The estimated intangible asset values and their useful lives could be impacted by a variety of factors that may become known to Aetna only upon access to additional information and/or by changes in such factors that may occur prior to completion of the merger. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory, legislative, legal, technological and competitive environments. Increased knowledge about these and/or other elements could result in a change to the estimated fair value of the identifiable Coventry intangible assets and/or to the estimated weighted-average useful lives from what Aetna has assumed in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The combined effect of any such changes could then also result in a significant increase or decrease to Aetna's estimate of associated amortization expense.

(*) Aetna assumed a 35% tax rate when estimating the deferred tax aspects of the acquisition.
(e) As of completion of the merger, property and equipment is required to be measured at fair value, unless those assets are classified as held-for-sale on the acquisition date. The acquired assets can include assets that are not intended to be used or sold, or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best use. Aetna does not have sufficient information at this time as to the specific nature, age, condition or location of Coventry's property and equipment, and Aetna does not know the appropriate valuation premise, in-use or in-exchange, as the valuation premise requires a certain level of knowledge about the assets being evaluated as well as a profile of the associated market participants. All of these elements can cause differences between fair value and net book value. Accordingly, for the purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Aetna has assumed that the current Coventry book values represent the best estimate of fair value except for capitalized internal-use software for which the historical book value was eliminated as the fair value was estimated in (b) above. This estimate is preliminary and subject to change and could vary materially from the actual value on the date the merger is completed.
Aetna and Coventry each have a Missouri Medicaid business. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information assumes Aetna will dispose of its Missouri Medicaid business at the time of the merger and continue to operate Coventry's Missouri Medicaid business. Specifically, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income reflect the elimination of the revenues associated with Aetna's Missouri Medicaid business as well as elimination of the costs specifically identifiable with that revenue. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects the disposal of Aetna's Missouri Medicaid business assuming that the book value of that business
approximates fair value, and also assumes cash consideration received equal to book value. The actual fair value of Aetna's Missouri Medicaid business, and the actual cash consideration received, may be greater than, or less than, book value.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not present a combined dividend per share amount. On April 27, 2012, July 27, 2012, and October 26, 2012, Aetna paid dividends of $0.175 per Aetna common share. On April 9, 2012, July 9, 2012, and October 8, 2012, Coventry paid dividends of $0.125 per share of Coventry common stock. Coventry is not permitted to declare, set aside or pay a dividend or other distribution other than its regular quarterly cash dividend in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, in an amount not in excess of $0.125 per share of Coventry common stock prior to completion of the merger, and any future payment of Coventry's quarterly dividend is subject to future approval and declaration by the Coventry board of directors. Prior to completion of the merger, Aetna is not permitted to declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution other than its regular cash dividend in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The dividend policy of Aetna following completion of the merger will be determined by the Aetna board of directors following completion of the merger.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect the projected realization of cost savings following completion of the merger. These cost savings opportunities are from administrative cost savings, as well as network and medical management savings. Although Aetna management projects that cost savings will result from the merger, there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved.
