HIGHLIGHTS
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     We are very gratified with AFLAC's performance for the second quarter and first half of 2003. AFLAC Japan again produced better-than-expected sales and financial results. Although sales in the United States grew at a single-digit rate, AFLAC U.S. posted solid financial results in the quarter. Our overall operating results and financial performance were in line with expectations. At the same time, we were especially pleased that we achieved our primary financial objective by increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15.8% for the quarter before the effect of currency translation.
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
     The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate enhanced the growth rates of our financial results in the second quarter, just as it did for the first three months of the year. However, we believe the best measure of AFLAC's performance is to evaluate our results before the effect of the yen because currency changes are outside of our control. The chart on page four compares selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes.
     Reflecting the stronger yen, total revenues were up 13.9% to $2.9 billion. Net earnings for the second quarter were $248 million, or $.48 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $212 million, or $.40 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2003 included realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the quarter also included a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the second quarter of 2002 was also a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share.
     In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Operating earnings presented in this report exclude the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133.
     Operating earnings were $240 million, compared with $202 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 21.1% to $.46, compared with $.38 per share in the second quarter of 2002. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.02 during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 15.8%, which was in line with our objective for earnings growth in 2003. Operating return on average shareholders' equity was 22.7% for the quarter.
     During the second quarter, we acquired 2.8 million shares of AFLAC stock. At the end of June 2003, we had approximately 13 million shares available for purchase under current repurchase authorization from the board of directors.
 
SIX MONTH RESULTS
     For the first half of 2003, total revenues grew 16.1% to $5.7 billion. Net earnings for the six months were $486 million, or $.93 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $395 million, or $.75 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the six months included realized investment losses of $10 million, or $.02 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $8 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the first half also included a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133, compared with a gain of $9 million, or $.02 per share for the first six months of 2002.
     Operating earnings for the six months were $483 million, or $.92 per diluted share, compared with $394 million, or $.74 per share in 2002. Excluding the $.04 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.9%.
AFLAC JAPAN
     AFLAC Japan produced strong sales and financial results in the quarter. Premium income in yen increased 6.4%. Net investment income was up 3.4%. Investment income growth in yen terms was restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 29% of AFLAC Japan's investment income is derived from dollar-denominated investments. Total revenues rose 6.0%. Due to the improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 12.5% to 13.3%, which resulted in a 12.4% increase in pretax operating earnings. For the six months in yen, premium income increased 6.4%, while net investment income rose 2.7%. Total revenues were up 6.0% and pretax operating earnings grew 14.1%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 118.49 in the second quarter was 7.2% stronger than the average rate of 127.04 in the second quarter of 2002. For the six months, the average exchange rate was 118.71, or 9.3% stronger than the rate of 129.77 a year ago. The strengthening of the yen for the quarter and the first half of the year magnified the growth rates of AFLAC Japan as reported in dollars.
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, second-quarter premium income in dollars rose 14.0% to $1.8 billion. Net investment income increased 10.8% to $348 million. Total revenues were up 13.6% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings climbed 20.5% to $282 million. For the six months, premium income rose 16.2% to $3.5 billion. Net investment income was up 12.2% to $689 million. Total revenues increased 15.8% to $4.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $567 million, or 24.8% higher than a year ago.
     Investment yields in Japan declined sharply in the second quarter. However, by the end of June yields had risen substantially, although they still remained at relatively low levels. During the second quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 3.51%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 3.86%. As of July 21, 2003, we had invested, or committed to invest, approximately 70% of our estimated 2003 cash flow at an average yield of 4.06%.
     AFLAC Japan's sales momentum continued with another quarter of better-than-expected total new annualized premium sales. Total new annualized premium sales rose 11.3% to 33.0 billion yen, or $278 million, in the second quarter. These sales results were the best in AFLAC Japan's history. For the first half of 2003, new sales increased 11.7% to 60.0 billion yen, or $506 million. Our sales results continued to benefit from our popular medical-related products. Rider MAX sold well despite difficult comparisons to last year and was the number one contributor to total new sales in the quarter. And sales of our new stand-alone medical policy, EVER, were 57% above last year's second quarter. With Japan's aging population and continued financial stress on the country's national health care system, we expect demand for our affordable cancer life and medical products to remain strong. We now believe that AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales will increase 7% to 10% in yen terms for the full year.
 
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. posted strong financial results in the second quarter despite slower new sales growth. Premium income rose 17.2% to $637 million. Net investment income was up 7.1% to $87 million. Total revenues increased 15.9% to $727 million, while pretax operating earnings rose 6.2% to $104 million. For the six months, premium income advanced 18.1% to $1.3 billion, and net investment income rose 8.5% to $175 million. Total revenues increased 16.8% to $1.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings were up 10.7% to $211 million.
     As expected, AFLAC U.S. produced a single-digit increase in total new annualized premium sales for the quarter. Total new annualized premium sales rose 4.0% to $264 million in the second quarter. For the six months, new sales were up 6.3% to $521 million. We again experienced very strong sales results in several of our top producing states. Other states, particularly those where we have been aggressively expanding our sales coordinator base, lagged during the quarter. We believe the changes we have made to our sales infrastructure will benefit our organization as the year progresses. However, it will take time for these changes to take hold. For the third quarter, we believe sales will likely increase in the 6% to 13% range. And if third quarter sales are at the high end of that range, then increasing sales by 10% to 15% for the year is a reasonable expectation.
     Although we faced very difficult comparisons to last year's second quarter, recruiting of new sales associates was up 2% for the second quarter and 4% for the six months. At the end of the second quarter, more than 57,100 licensed sales associates represented AFLAC in the United States. And the number of sales associates producing business for us on a monthly average basis rose 10.0% to 17,000 in the quarter. As we expand the number of sales coordinators, we should see continued growth of our sales force. That in turn should help us improve our sales growth and strengthen our leading position in the market for supplemental insurance products in the vast U.S. marketplace.
DIVIDEND
     For the second time this year, the board of directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend. The board increased the quarterly dividend 14.3% from $.07 to $.08 per share. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend 16.7% in the first quarter of 2003. As a result, the third quarter dividend payment will be 33.3% higher than the dividend we paid in the third quarter of 2002. The third quarter dividend is payable on September 2, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 14, 2003.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, our results for the first half of 2003 have been rewarding. With the exception of U.S. sales growth, we are pleased with AFLAC's operating performance so far this year. Most importantly, we believe we are very well positioned for strong earnings growth in 2003. In May 2001, we established a 2003 objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% to 17% excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range, we set a specific target earlier this year of earning $1.80 per diluted share in 2003, or a 15.4% increase over 2002. With half of the year complete, we now expect to generate operating earnings per share growth at the high end of the 15% to 17% range. Beyond 2003, we expect our strong earnings growth to continue. Our objective for 2004 and 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe those earnings objectives reflect the many opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan.
 
     As we look ahead, our principal challenge in the United States is to regain sales momentum. In Japan we continue to operate in a difficult economy accompanied by low interest rates. Yet we believe we can overcome those challenges and achieve our stated earnings objectives in the coming years. The United States is a vast and underserved market for supplemental health insurance products. In Japan we believe our strong balance sheet and affordable insurance products will continue to be attractive to consumers. And we believe we have competitive strengths that will enable us to tap into the potential of the U.S. and Japanese markets.
