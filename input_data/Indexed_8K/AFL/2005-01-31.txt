EXHIBIT INDEX:
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - January 31, 2005 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues, which reflected a stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate, were $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, or 21.1% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $418 million, or $.81 per diluted share, compared with $73 million, or $.14 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 included realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $175 million, or $.34 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net earnings in the fourth quarter also included a loss of $7 million, or $.02 per diluted share, as a result of the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $14 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Fourth quarter net earnings in 2004 also benefited by $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share, fro m a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $300 million, compared with $262 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.0% to $.59, compared with $.50 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003.
For the year, total revenues rose 16.0% to $13.3 billion in 2004. Net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.52 per diluted share, compared with $795 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, a year ago. Operating earnings were $1.2 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $989 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, in 2003. Excluding the benefit of $.08 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share increased 17.5% for the year.
The board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend 15.8% from $.095 to $.11 per share, effective with the first quarter of 2005. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2005. This marks the 22 consecutive year in which the cash dividend has been increased.
nd
Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We were pleased that Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales were better than our expectations for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, new sales increased 5.3% from a year ago to a record 33.4 billion yen, or $316 million. New sales in the quarter benefited from solid sales growth of the medical and ordinary life categories. Total new annualized premium sales were up 1.1% to 122.5 billion yen, or $1.1 billion for the full year. New sales growth in 2004 was held down by declines in Rider MAX sales and conversions in addition to lower sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life. Excluding sales through Dai-ichi, sales from our traditional channels were up 9.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.0% for the year.
"We introduced two new versions of EVER in January 2005 in order to better segment the market and extend the growth of medical sales. We believe the added benefits of the new products will appeal to a broader group of consumers. We also believe that the continued expansion of our product line and sales force, combined with Aflac's leading market position, will enable us to produce a 5% to 10% increase in total new annualized premium sales in yen for 2005.
"Aflac U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter of $343 million, a .5% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2003. For the year, total new sales were up 5.1% to $1.2 billion. These results were below our expectations for both the quarter and for the year. We continue to believe our slower sales growth has resulted primarily from the significant changes we made to our sales management team in 2003 and at the start of 2004. While we believe the basics of our infrastructure are in place, we will continue to focus on providing resources and support to strengthen, train, and grow our sales force.
"We are convinced that the best approach to the vast U.S. market potential is to expand our distribution system and our product line. In that regard, we were encouraged that recruitment of new sales associates picked up in the fourth quarter. New agent recruitment rose 5.9% in the fourth quarter, which was the largest increase we have experienced since the fourth quarter of 2002. We have also restructured our training department and are intensifying our training efforts, which we hope will lead to improved agent retention and productivity. In the product area, we recently developed an innovative vision product that will be rolled out to the market in mid-2005. We believe it is unique to the marketplace, and we look for vision care to be a solid addition to our already strong product line. We are convinced we are taking the correct steps to re-ignite new sales growth. However, we believe new sales in the first quarter of 2005 will likely decline, due in part to difficult comparisons to 2004. As a result, we believe it will be the second quarter at the earliest before we see improved growth. As such, we have established a target of a 3% to 8% increase in new sales for 2005.
"Our view of the U.S. and Japanese markets has not changed, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for our business. We believe rising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers will drive a growing need for the products we sell. Furthermore, we believe our business model is sound, and that our many competitive strengths are intact.
"We are very pleased that our financial results kept pace with our expectations throughout 2004. And we are proud that we exceeded our primary financial objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 17% in 2004, excluding the impact of the yen. Our ability to achieve financial targets when new sales are soft reflects the underlying strength of our operations. Due to that strength, our goals for 2005 and 2006 remain unchanged. Our objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% in 2005 and 2006 before currency translation."

HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 16.0% in the fourth quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share increased 18.0%).
We purchased 3.1 million of Aflac's shares in the fourth quarter.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales exceeded expectations in the quarter.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     The fourth quarter concluded a year of record financial results for Aflac Incorporated. In every quarter of 2004, we were very pleased with the strong financial performance our operations produced. At the same time, however, we were disappointed with the rate of new sales growth in both Japan and the United States. Although new sales increased in each market for the year, we fell short of our sales growth targets. Yet despite weaker sales, we exceeded our primary financial objective of a 17% increase in operating earnings per diluted share for the year before the impact of currency translation.
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
     Aflac's results were again helped by the stronger yen in relation to the dollar. Reflecting the stronger yen, total revenues were $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, up 21.1% from $2.8 billion in 2003. Net earnings were $418 million, or $.81 per diluted share, compared with $73 million, or $.14 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 included realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $175 million, or $.34 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net earnings in the fourth quarter also included a loss of $7 million, or $.02 per diluted share, as a result of the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $14 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Fourth-quarter net earnings in 2 004 also benefited by $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share, from a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore can obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating to net earnings appears on Page 5.
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our insurance operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on Page 4 compares selected income statement i tems with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of the yen.
 
     Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $300 million, compared with $262 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.0% to $.59, compared with $.50 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003.
     During the fourth quarter, we purchased 3.1 million shares of Aflac stock. That brought the total number of shares purchased in 2004 to 10 million. We had approximately 27 million shares available for purchase under authorization from the board of directors as of December 31, 2004.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
     Like the fourth quarter, our results for the year were favorably impacted by the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate. Total revenues rose 16.0% to $13.3 billion in 2004, compared with $11.4 billion in 2003. Net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.52 per diluted share, compared with $795 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share in 2004, compared with realized investment losses of $191 million, or $.37 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings also included a loss of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the impact from SFAS 133, compared with a loss of $3 million in 2003. In addition, net earnings in 2004 reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain Aflac Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government and a benefit of $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share, from the release of the valuation allo wance for deferred tax assets.
     Operating earnings for the year were $1.2 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $989 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, in 2003. Excluding the $.08 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share increased 17.5%, which was better than our goal for the year.
AFLAC JAPAN
     In the fourth quarter of 2004, Aflac Japan's premium income in yen increased 6.8% and net investment income rose 4.8%. Investment income growth in yen terms was again restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 30% of Aflac Japan's investment income is dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 6.6%. The pretax operating profit margin improved to 13.9%, compared with 12.6% a year ago, due to a lower benefit ratio. As a result, pretax operating earnings increased 17.6% in the fourth quarter. For the year, premium income grew 6.7%, while net investment income increased 2.3%. Total revenues were up 6.0%, and pretax operating earnings rose 14.9%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 106.26 in the fourth quarter was 2.6% stronger than the average rate of 109.06 in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the year, the average exchange rate was 108.26, or 7.1% stronger than the rate of 115.95 a year ago. The stronger yen in relation to the dollar for both the quarter and the year magnified the growth rates of Aflac Japan as reported in dollars.
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, fourth quarter premium income in dollars increased 9.8% to $2.2 billion. Net investment income was up 7.8% to $406 million. Total revenues rose 9.7% to $2.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $359 million, an increase of 20.9% from a year ago. For the year in dollars, premium income rose 14.2% to $8.4 billion. Net investment income was up 9.6% to $1.6 billion. Total revenues were $9.9 billion, or 13.4% higher than a year ago. Pretax operating earnings were $1.4 billion, an increase of 23.1% over 2003.
 
     In the fourth quarter, Japanese investment yields declined slightly, compared with the third quarter, although they were higher than in the fourth quarter of 2003. The yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 2.08% in fourth quarter of 2004, compared with 2.24% in the third quarter and 1.87% a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.65%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 2.86%.
     We were pleased that Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales were better than our expectations for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, new sales increased 5.3% from a year ago to 33.4 billion yen, or $316 million. New sales in the quarter benefited from solid sales growth of the medical and ordinary life categories. Total new annualized premium sales were up 1.1% to 122.5 billion yen, or $1.1 billion for the full year. New sales growth in 2004 was held down by declines in Rider MAX sales and conversions in addition to lower sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life. Excluding sales through Dai-ichi, sales from our traditional channels were up 9.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.0% for the year.
a record
     We introduced two new versions of EVER in January 2005 in order to better segment the market and extend the growth of medical sales. We believe the added benefits of the new products will appeal to a broader group of consumers. We also believe that the continued expansion of our product line and sales force, combined with Aflac's leading market position, will enable us to produce a 5% to 10% increase in total new annualized premium sales in yen for 2005.
AFLAC U.S.
     Aflac U.S. premium income rose 11.9% to $753 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net investment income was up 6.1% to $101 million. Total revenues increased 11.2% to $857 million and pretax operating earnings grew 5.9% to $130 million. For the year, premium income was $2.9 billion, an increase of 13.1% over 2003. Net investment income rose 9.4% to $396 million. Total revenues increased 12.6% to $3.3 billion. Pretax operating earnings were up 11.5% to $502 million.
     Aflac U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter of $343 million, a .5% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2003. For the year, total new sales were up 5.1% to $1.2 billion. These results were below our expectations for both the quarter and for the year. We continue to believe our slower sales growth has resulted primarily from the significant changes we made to our sales management team in 2003 and at the start of 2004. While we believe the basics of our infrastructure are in place, we will continue to expand, train and strengthen all areas of our sales force.
     We are convinced that the best approach to the vast U.S. market potential is to expand our distribution system and our product line. In that regard, we were encouraged that recruitment of new sales associates picked up in the fourth quarter. New agent recruitment rose 5.9% in the fourth quarter, which was the largest increase we have experienced since the fourth quarter of 2002. We have also restructured our training department and are intensifying our training efforts, which we hope will lead to improved agent retention and productivity. In the product area, we recently developed an innovative vision product that will be rolled out to the market in mid-2005. We believe it is unique to the marketplace, and we look for vision care to be a solid addition to our already strong product line. We are convinced we are taking the correct steps to re-ignite new sales growth. However, we believe new sales in the first quarter of 2005 will likely decline, due in part to difficult comparisons to 2004. As a result, we believe it will be the second quarter at the earliest before we see improved growth. As such, we have established a target of a 3% to 8% increase in new sales for 2005.
 
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend 15.8% from $.095 to $.11 per share, effective with the first quarter of 2005. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2005. This marks the 22 consecutive year in which the cash dividend has been increased.
nd
OUTLOOK
     Our view of the U.S. and Japanese markets has not changed, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for our business. We believe rising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers will drive a growing need for the products we sell. Furthermore, we believe our business model is sound, and that our many competitive strengths are intact.
     We are very pleased that our financial results kept pace with our expectations throughout 2004. And we are proud that we exceeded our primary financial objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 17% in 2004, excluding the impact of the yen.
