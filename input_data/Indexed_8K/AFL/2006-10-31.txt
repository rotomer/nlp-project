Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On October 21, 2006, the board of directors of Aflac Incorporated (the "Company") voted to amend Article III, Section 2(a) of the Company's Bylaws to change the mandatory retirement age provisions for individuals serving as directors of the Company.  The amendment, which changed the retirement age from 70 to 75 for individuals elected to the board of directors for the first time after April 27, 1992, will be effective immediately.  Previously, individuals who were elected to the board of directors for the first time after April 27, 1992 were subject to mandatory retirement from the board of directors at age 70.

EXHIBIT 3.1
Article III, Section 2(a) of the Bylaws has been amended to read in its entirety as follows:
Section 2.  .
Number, Election and Term
(a) The number of Directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be not less than three (3) or more than twenty-five (25). The specific number of Directors within such range shall be fixed or changed from time to time by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office. A decrease in the number of Directors shall not have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.
Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws shareholders shall elect Directors by a vote of not less than a plurality of the votes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. Each Director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation, removal from office or death.  No person 20 years of age or younger or 75 years of age or older shall be eligible for election, reelection, appointment, or reappointment as a member of the Board of Directors.  Directors need not be residents of the State of Georgia or shareholders of the Corporation.
