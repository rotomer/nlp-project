EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  January 16, 2007  Aflac Incorporated today announced that effective February 1, 2007, Tohru Tonoike will assume the position of deputy president of Aflac Japan. He will report to Aki Kan, president and chief operating officer of Aflac Japan and chairman of Aflac International.
Prior to joining Aflac, Tonoike worked for Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank, which later merged with two other banks to form the Mizuho Financial Group. Since 2005 he has served as president and representative director of Dai-ichi Kangyo Asset Management Company, another division of the Mizuho Financial Group, where he will remain until February 1, 2007.
Tonoike has served on the Aflac board of directors since November 1, 2004.  He has submitted his resignation from the board of directors, effective January 31, 2007.  His seat on Aflac's board of directors will be filled by an independent director to be voted upon at Aflac's 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
In commenting on Tonoike's new role within Aflac's management, Aflac Japan President and Chief Operating Officer Aki Kan said: "We are thrilled Tonoike-san is joining our senior management team. As an authority in the banking industry and as a native expert on Japan's unique business culture, his experience will complement our organization extremely well. Because Aflac is a U.S.-based company operating in Japan, Tonoike's cultural knowledge, combined with his practical business know-how and experience, will help guide Aflac in identifying and capitalizing on the opportunities in Japan's insurance market."
Aflac Incorporated Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos added: "Through his service on the board of directors of Aflac Incorporated, Tonoike-san has developed a strong understanding of our company and our business needs and operations. Adding the scope of his expertise and knowledge to our senior management team will help Aflac Japan's operations overall as we address the unique challenges and opportunities we face in Japan."
