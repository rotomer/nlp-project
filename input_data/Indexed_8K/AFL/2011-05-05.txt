The Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of Aflac Incorporated (the "Company") was held on May 2, 2011. Matters submitted to the shareholders and voted upon at the meeting, which are more fully described in the Company's Proxy Statement, are as follows: (1) Election of 15 members to the board of directors; (2) Approval of a non-binding advisory proposal on compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in the Proxy Statement; (3) A non-binding advisory proposal on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation; and (4) Ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2011. The shareholders approved proposals (1), (2) and (4), and they approved a frequency of "one year" for proposal (3).
The following is a summary of the votes cast, as well as the number of abstention and broker non-votes, as to each proposal, including a separate tabulation with respect to each nominee for director.
 
 
 
 
 
With respect to proposal (3), the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation, the Aflac Incorporated board of directors recommended that future advisory votes on executive compensation occur once per year. Shareholder votes on this matter indicate concurrence; therefore, future advisory votes on executive compensation will take place every year.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
