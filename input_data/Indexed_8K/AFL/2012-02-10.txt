The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement, dated February 8, 2012, by and among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representatives of the several underwriters included on Schedule 1 thereto. The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the sale of these Notes for debt repayment in full at maturity of the Company's $347 million (using the September 30, 2011 Yen / U.S. Dollar exchange rate of 76.65) aggregate principal amount of 1.87% Samurai notes due June 2012 and for general corporate purposes, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, if needed.

Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year, beginning on August 15, 2012. The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date; plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.
The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a fifth supplemental indenture with respect to the 2017 Notes, dated as of February 10, 2012 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture"), and as supplemented by a sixth supplemental indenture with respect to the 2022 Notes, dated as of February 10, 2012 (the "Sixth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Fifth Supplemental Indenture and the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including, among other things, nonpayment, failure to comply with the other agreements in the Indenture for a period of 90 days, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization.

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free
 
Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as
 
the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company
 
agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10179, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282-2198, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14.

No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company
 
agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $400,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the Company may re-open this series of Senior Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.
The Senior Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below) in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto.
The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
Section 1.02 . The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.
Definitions
"Global Security" means, with respect to any series of securities, a security authenticated and delivered under the Original Indenture executed by the Company and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction, all in accordance with the Original Indenture, which shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
 
"Interest Payment Date" means February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2012.
"Regular Record Date" means, with respect to each Interest Payment Date, the close of business on February 1 or August 1 immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.

Section 1.03 . The principal of the Senior Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 2.65% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from February 10, 2012. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on August 15, 2012, to the Person in whose name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date (as defined below) as provided herein, will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
Payment of Principal and Interest
Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of
 
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Section 1.04 . The Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.
Section 1.06 . No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
Transfer

"Treasury Rate" means (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of J.P.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.

The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.

Establishment
There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $350,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this Sixth Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the Company may re-open this series of Senior Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.
The Senior Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below) in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto.
The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
Section 1.02 . The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.
Definitions
"Global Security" means, with respect to any series of securities, a security authenticated and delivered under the Original Indenture executed by the Company and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction, all in accordance with the Original Indenture, which shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
 
"Interest Payment Date" means February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2012.

Section 1.03 . The principal of the Senior Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 4.00% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from February 10, 2012. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on August 15, 2012, to the Person in whose name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date (as defined below) as provided herein, will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
Payment of Principal and Interest
Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of
 
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Section 1.04 . The Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.

The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of J.P.

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.

"Treasury Rate" means (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.

Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their successors, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of J.P.

Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but no more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Senior Notes to be redeemed.

The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof.

Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Senior Note on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
