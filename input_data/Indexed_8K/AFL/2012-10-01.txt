(26) whether and under what circumstances any or all of the provisions of this Indenture relating to the subordination of the Securities (including the provisions of Article XIII), or different subordination provisions, including a different definition of "Senior Indebtedness" will apply or cease to apply to Securities of the series; and
(27) any other terms of the series (which terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, but may modify, amend, supplement or delete any of the terms of this Indenture with respect to such series).
All Securities of any one series and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto, shall be substantially identical, except in the case of Registered Securities as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided by or pursuant to the Board Resolution or Officer's Certificate referred to above or as set forth in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and may pursuant to the Board Resolution or Officer's Certificate be issued from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Indenture, if so provided by or pursuant to such Board Resolution, such Officer's Certificate or in any such indenture supplemental hereto.
Section 2.4 . (1) The Issuer may deliver Securities of any series having attached thereto appropriate Coupons, if any, executed by the Issuer to the Trustee for authentication together with the applicable documents referred to below in this Section, and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver such Securities to or upon the order of the Issuer (contained in the Order referred to below in this Section) or pursuant to such procedures acceptable to the Trustee and to such recipients as may be specified from time to time by an Order. The maturity date, original issue date, interest rate and any other terms of the Securities of such series and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto shall be determined by or pursuant to such Order and procedures. In authenticating such Securities and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be given and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, unless and until such documents have been superseded or revoked with notice thereof having been given to the Trustee:
Authentication and Delivery of Securities
(a) an Order requesting such authentication and setting forth delivery instructions if the Securities and Coupons, if any, are not to be delivered to the Issuer, provided that, with respect to
 
Securities of a series subject to a Periodic Offering, (i) such Order may be delivered by the Issuer to the Trustee prior to the delivery to the Trustee of such Securities for authentication and delivery, (ii) the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities of such series for original issue from time to time, in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the aggregate principal amount established for such series, pursuant to an Order or pursuant to procedures acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified from time to time by an Order and (iii) the maturity date or dates, original issue date or dates, interest rate or rates and any other terms of Securities of such series shall be determined by an Order or pursuant to such procedures;
(b) any Board Resolution, Officer's Certificate and/or executed supplemental indenture referred to in Sections 2.1 and 2.3 by or pursuant to which the forms and terms of the Securities and Coupons, if any, were established;
(c) an Officer's Certificate setting forth the form or forms and terms of the Securities and Coupons, if any, stating that the form or forms and terms of the Securities and Coupons, if any, have been established pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.3 and stating that the conditions precedent, if any, provided for in the Indenture have been complied with; and
(d) an Opinion of Counsel stating that the conditions precedent, if any, provided for in the Indenture have been complied with.
(2) The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken by the Issuer or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or board of trustees, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders or would affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities, this Indenture or otherwise.
(3) If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 2.3 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in global form, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and the Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Securities in global form that (a) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities of such series issued and not yet canceled, (b) if such Securities are Registered Securities, shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Security or Securities in global form or the nominee of such Depositary, (c) if such Securities are Registered Securities, shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions and (d) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to the nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary." The Trustee shall have no responsibility for any action taken or not taken by the Depositary.
(4) Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 2.3 must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and any other applicable statute or regulation.
Section 2.5 . The Securities and, if applicable, each Coupon appertaining thereto shall be signed on behalf of the Issuer by the chairman or vice chairman of its Board of Directors or its president or any executive, senior or other vice president or its treasurer, which may, but need not, be attested. Such signatures may be the manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such officers. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
Execution of Securities
In case any officer of the Issuer who shall have signed any of the Securities or Coupons, if any, shall cease to be such officer before the Security or Coupon so signed (or the Security to which the Coupon so signed appertains) shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such
 
Security or Coupon nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Security or Coupon had not ceased to be such officer of the Issuer; and any Security or Coupon may be signed on behalf of the Issuer by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security or Coupon, shall be the proper officers of the Issuer, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
Section 2.6 . Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form herein before recited, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. No Coupon shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or shall be valid and obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication on the Security to which such Coupon appertains shall have been duly executed by the Trustee. The execution of such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Certificate of Authentication
Section 2.7 . The Securities of each series shall be issuable as Registered Securities or Unregistered Securities in denominations established as contemplated by Section 2.3 or, with respect to the Registered Securities of any series, if not so established, in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. If denominations of Unregistered Securities of any series are not so established, such Securities shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and $5,000. The Securities of each series shall be numbered, lettered or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers of the Issuer executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee, as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof.
Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of Interest
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Unregistered Security shall be dated as provided in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Issuer referred to in Section 2.3. The Securities of each series shall bear interest, if any, from the date, and such interest shall be payable on the dates, established as contemplated by Section 2.3.
The person in whose name any Registered Security of any series is registered at the close of business on any record date applicable to a particular series with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Registered Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names Outstanding Registered Securities for such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Holders of Registered Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) for the Securities of any series shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Registered Securities of such series established as contemplated by Section 2.3, or, if no such date is so established, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
Section 2.8 . (1) The Issuer will keep at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2 for each series of Securities a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will provide for the registration of Registered Securities of such series and the registration of transfer of Registered Securities of such series. Such register shall be in written form in the English language. At all reasonable times such register or registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
 
(2) Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Registered Security or Registered Securities of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
Unregistered Securities (except for any temporary Unregistered Securities in global form) and Coupons (except for Coupons attached to any temporary Unregistered Securities in global form) shall be transferable by delivery.
(3) (a) At the option of the Holder thereof, Registered Securities of any series (other than a Registered Security in global form, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for a Registered Security or Registered Securities of such series having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Registered Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2 and upon payment, if the Issuer shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
      (b) Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3, at the option of the Holder, Unregistered Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered Securities (if the Securities of such series are issuable in registered form) or Unregistered Securities (if Unregistered Securities of such series are issuable in more than one denomination and such exchanges are permitted by such series) of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of an Unregistered Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Unregistered Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Issuer and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Issuer and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment as provided in Section 3.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any Unregistered Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any record date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant interest payment date, or (ii) any special record date for payment of defaulted interest and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related date for payment of defaulted interest, such Unregistered Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such interest or defaulted interest payment date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Unregistered Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the person so surrendering the Unregistered Security), and interest or defaulted interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Unregistered Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon, when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
      (c) Registered Securities of any series may not be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such series unless (i) otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3 and (ii) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that (A) the Issuer has received from the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that the inclusion of terms permitting Registered Securities to be exchanged for Unregistered Securities would result in no adverse Federal income tax effect to the Issuer or to any Holder. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities and Coupons surrendered upon any exchange or transfer provided for in this Indenture shall
 
be canceled promptly and disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its procedures for the disposition of cancelled securities in effect as of the date of such cancellation.
(4) All Registered Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by the Holder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.
The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of such series to be redeemed or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.8, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Registered Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for any Registered Securities of a series represented by one or more Registered Securities in global form notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Registered Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Registered Securities shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.4, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under Section 2.4 with respect to such Registered Securities. If a successor Depositary eligible under Section 2.4 for such Registered Securities is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer's election pursuant to Section 2.3 that such Registered Securities be represented by one or more Registered Securities in global form shall no longer be effective and the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form without Coupons, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registered Security or Securities in global form representing such Registered Securities in exchange for such Registered Security or Securities in global form.
The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Registered Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Registered Securities in global form shall no longer be represented by a Registered Security or Securities in global form. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form without Coupons, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registered Security or Securities in global form representing such Registered Securities, in exchange for such Registered Security or Securities in global form.
If specified by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect to Securities represented by a Registered Security in global form, the Depositary for such Registered Security in global form may surrender such Registered Security in global form in exchange in whole or in part for Registered Securities of the same series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
 
(a) to the Person specified by such Depositary a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Registered Security in global form; and
(b) to such Depositary a new Registered Security in global form in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Registered Security in global form and the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (a) above.
Upon the exchange of a Registered Security in global form for Registered Securities in definitive form without Coupons, in authorized denominations, such Registered Security in global form shall be canceled by the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. Registered Securities in definitive form issued in exchange for a Registered Security in global form pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Registered Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. The Trustee or such agent shall deliver such Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
(6) All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
(7) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the terms of any series of Securities to the contrary, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee (any of which, other than the Issuer, shall conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, on an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel) shall be required to exchange any Unregistered Security for a Registered Security if such exchange would result in adverse income tax consequences to the Issuer.
(8) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depositary Participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
Section 2.9 . In case any Security or any Coupon appertaining to any Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Security of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date, bearing a number or other distinguishing symbol not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons appertaining to the Securities so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen, or in exchange or substitution for the Security to which such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security or Coupon shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof and in the case of mutilation or defacement shall surrender the Security and related Coupons to the Trustee or such agent.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
 
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security or Coupon, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) or its agent connected therewith. In case any Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same or the relevant Coupon (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security or Coupon), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof.
Every substitute Security or Coupon of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security or Coupon is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities or Coupons of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities and Coupons shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and Coupons and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.10 . All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee or any agent of the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee or its agent for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be canceled by it; and no Securities or Coupons shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee or its agent shall dispose of canceled Securities and Coupons held by it in accordance with its procedures for the disposition of cancelled securities in effect as of the date of such cancellation. If the Issuer or its agent shall acquire any of the Securities or Coupons, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities or Coupons unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee or its agent for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof
Section 2.11 . Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as Registered Securities without Coupons, or as Unregistered Securities with or without Coupons attached thereto, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof. Temporary Securities may contain such references to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Registered Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2 and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, at any agency maintained by the Issuer for such purpose as specified pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series having authorized denominations and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, having attached thereto any appropriate Coupons. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the
Temporary Securities
 
same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series, unless otherwise established pursuant to Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section are subject to any restrictions or limitations on the issue and delivery of temporary Unregistered Securities of any series that may be established pursuant to Section 2.3 (including any provision that Unregistered Securities of such series initially be issued in the form of a single Unregistered Security in global form to be delivered to a Depositary or agency located outside the United States and the procedures pursuant to which Unregistered Securities in definitive or global form of such series would be issued in exchange for such temporary Unregistered Security in global form).
Section 2.12 . Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
Global Securities
Section 2.13 . The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so used by the Issuer, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
CUSIP Numbers
provided
Section 3.1 . The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, each of the Securities of such series (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities and in the Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto and in this Indenture. The interest on Securities with Coupons attached (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several Coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature. If any temporary Unregistered Security provides that interest thereon may be paid while such Security is in temporary form, the interest on any such temporary Unregistered Security (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Security) shall be paid, as to the installments of interest evidenced by Coupons attached thereto, if any, only upon presentation and surrender thereof, and, as to the other installments of interest, if any, only upon presentation of such Securities for notation thereon of the payment of such interest, in each case subject to any restrictions that may be established pursuant to Section 2.3.
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
Section 3.2 So long as any Securities are issued as Registered Securities, the Issuer will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where the Registered Securities of each series may be presented for payment, where the Securities of each series may be presented for exchange as is provided in this Indenture and, if applicable, pursuant to Section 2.3 and where the Registered Securities of each series may be presented for registration of transfer as in this Indenture provided.
Offices for Payments, Etc.
So long as any Securities are issued as Unregistered Securities, the Issuer will maintain one or more offices or agencies in a city or cities located outside the United States (including any city in which such an agency is required to be maintained under the rules of any shares exchange on which the Securities of such series are listed) where the Unregistered Securities, if any, of each series and Coupons, if any,
 
appertaining thereto may be presented for payment. No payment on any Unregistered Security or Coupon will be made upon presentation of such Unregistered Security or Coupon at an agency of the Issuer within the United States nor will any payment be made by transfer to an account in, or by mail to an address in, the United States unless pursuant to applicable United States laws and regulations then in effect such payment can be made without adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments in Dollars of Unregistered Securities of any series and Coupons appertaining thereto which are payable in Dollars may be made at an agency of the Issuer maintained in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, if such payment in Dollars at each agency maintained by the Issuer outside the United States for payment on such Unregistered Securities is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions.
The Issuer will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Securities of any series, the Coupons appertaining thereto or this Indenture may be served.
The Issuer will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of each such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. In case the Issuer shall fail to maintain any agency required by this Section, or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location of any of the above agencies, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
The Issuer may from time to time designate one or more additional offices or agencies where the Securities of a series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may be presented for payment, where the Securities of that series may be presented for exchange as provided in this Indenture and pursuant to Section 2.3 and where the Registered Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer as in this Indenture provided, and the Issuer may from time to time rescind any such designation, as the Issuer may deem desirable or expedient; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Issuer of its obligation to maintain the agencies provided for in this Section. The Issuer will give to the Trustee prompt written notice of any such designation or rescission thereof.
Section 3.3 . If the Issuer shall at any time act as its own paying agent, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust; Unclaimed Money
Whenever the Issuer shall have one or more paying agents, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, deposit with the paying agent or paying agents a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled to such principal, premium, if any, or interest, and, unless such paying agent is the Trustee, the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Issuer will cause each paying agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such paying agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such paying agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent, or then held by the Issuer in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on Order, or, if then held by the Issuer, shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such paying agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such paying agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published at least once, in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or, in the case of Unregistered Securities, at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in London, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer.

(5) a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered adjudging the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, and such decree or order shall have continued undischarged and unstayed for a period of 120 days; or a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of a receiver or liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or of its or their property, or for the winding up or liquidation of its or their affairs, shall have been entered, and such decree or order shall have remained in force and unstayed for a period of 120 days; or
(6) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent to the appointment or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or similar official) of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its or their property, or make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its or their respective debts generally as they become due; or

Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Article II, if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(5) or 5.1(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the principal of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(5) or 5.1(6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable.
At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of , and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate per annum or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) expressed in the Securities of that series (or at the respective rates of interest or Yields to Maturity of all the Securities, as the case may be) to the date of such payment or deposit) and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 6.6, and (ii) any and all Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) that shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 5.10.
For all purposes under this Indenture, unless otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue
 
Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities.
Section 5.2 . (1) The Issuer covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of any series when such interest shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days or (b) in case default shall be made in the payment of all or any part of the principal of any of the Securities of any series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of such series or upon any redemption or by declaration or otherwise, then upon demand of the Trustee, the Issuer will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such series the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on all Securities of such series, and such Coupons, for principal or interest, as the case may be (with interest to the date of such payment upon the overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified in the Securities of such series); and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct.
Collection of Indebtedness by Trustee; Trustee May Prove Debt
Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the Issuer may pay the principal of and interest on the Securities of any series to the registered holders, whether or not the Securities of such series be overdue.

(3) In case there shall be pending proceedings relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor, or in case of any other comparable judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and interest (or, if the Securities of any series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of any series, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except as caused by his own negligence or willful misconduct) and of the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor,
 
(b) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the holders of the Securities of any series in any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable proceedings, and
(c) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Securityholders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee, receiver, or liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Securityholders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person.

(5) In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities in respect to which such action was taken, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities parties to any such proceedings.

Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings
Section 5.6 . No Holder of any Security of any series or of any Coupon appertaining thereto shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action or proceedings in its own name as trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such action or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.9; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Security or Coupon with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Securities of any series or Coupons appertaining to such Securities shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holder of Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders of Securities of the applicable series and Coupons appertaining to such Securities.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series affected at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by this Indenture; provided that such direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with law and the provisions of this Indenture and that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.
Control by Holders of Securities
Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right of the Trustee in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction or directions by Securityholders.
Section 5.10 . Prior to the acceleration of the maturity of any Securities as provided in Section 5.1, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding with respect to which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing may on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series waive any past default or Event of Default described in Section 5.1 and its consequences, except (i) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected or (ii) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of such series. In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all such Securities shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Waiver of Past Defaults
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, and not to have occurred for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 5.11 .. The Trustee shall, within ninety days after the occurrence of a default with respect to the Securities of any series, give notice of all defaults with respect to that series actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee (1) if any Unregistered Securities of that series are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof, by publication at least once an Authorized Newspaper in London and (2) to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, unless in each case such defaults shall have been cured before the mailing or publication of such notice (the term "defaults" for the purpose of this Section being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment on such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such series.

In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise with respect to such series of Securities such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

(ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein unless specifically required by this Indenture).

(d) the Trustee shall not be required to take notice, and shall not be deemed to have notice, of any default or Event of Default hereunder, except Events of Default described in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of Section 5.1 hereof, unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall be notified specifically of the default or Event of Default on a written instrument or document delivered to it at its Corporate Trust Office, which such notice references the Securities and this Indenture, by the Issuer or by the Holders of at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities then Outstanding. In the absence of delivery of notice satisfying those requirements, the Trustee may assume conclusively that there is no default or Event of Default, except as noted.
(3) None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not reasonably assured to it.

(1) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer and (a) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, by giving notice of such resignation to the Holders thereof, by publication, at the Issuer's expense, at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and (b) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, by mailing notice of such resignation to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee and (c) by mailing notice of such resignation to the Holders of then Outstanding Registered Securities of each series affected at their addresses as they shall appear on the registry books. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee or Trustees. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition, at the Issuer's expense, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.12, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

(2) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
(a) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the
 
Issuer or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or

(c) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
then, in any such case, the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities and appoint a successor Trustee for such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor Trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(3) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of such series and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor Trustee so appointed and to the Issuer the evidence provided for in Section 7.1 of the action in that regard taken by such Securityholders.
(4) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided in Section 6.11.
Section 6.11 . Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.10 shall execute and deliver to the Issuer and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee with respect to all or any applicable series shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee for such series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer or of the successor Trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the Trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 3.3, pay over to the successor Trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights and powers. Any Trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such Trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee
If a successor Trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental

If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 6.10. If the Issuer fails to give such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be given at the expense of the Issuer.
Section 6.12 . Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.

Securities of each such series authenticated by such Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee. Whenever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities of any series by the Trustee or to the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent for such series and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf

Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent with respect to all series of Securities for which it served as Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible shall, resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Issuer.
Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14 with respect to one or more series of Securities, the Trustee shall upon receipt of an Order appoint a successor Authenticating Agent and the Issuer shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.4. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent. The Issuer agrees to pay to the Authenticating Agent for such series from time to time reasonable compensation. The Authenticating Agent for the Securities of any series shall have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Trustee.
Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6 and 7.3 shall be applicable to any Authenticating Agent.
Section 7.1 . Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders
Section 7.2 . Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his or her agent or proxy may be proved in the following manner:
Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities
(1) The fact and date of the execution by any Holder of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds or administer oaths that the person executing such instruments acknowledged to him or her the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by or on behalf of any legal entity other than an individual, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of the authority of the person executing the same.
(2) The fact of the holding by any Holder of an Unregistered Security of any series, and the identifying number of such Security and the date of his or her holding the same, may be proved by the
 
production of such Security or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer wherever situated satisfactory to the Trustee, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state that on the date thereof a Security of such series bearing a specified identifying number was deposited with or exhibited to such trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer by the person named in such certificate. Any such certificate may be issued in respect of one or more Unregistered Securities of one or more series specified therein. The holding by the person named in any such certificate of any Unregistered Securities of any series specified therein shall be presumed to continue for a period of one year from the date of such certificate unless at the time of any determination of such holding (a) another certificate bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Securities shall be produced, or (b) the Securities of such series specified in such certificate shall be produced by some other person, or (c) the Securities of such series specified in such certificate shall have ceased to be Outstanding. Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the fact and date of the execution of any such instrument and the amount and numbers of Securities of any series held by the person so executing such instrument and the amount and numbers of any Security or Securities for such series may also be proven in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee for such series or in any other manner which the Trustee for such series may deem sufficient.
(3) In the case of Registered Securities, the ownership of such Securities shall be proved by the Security register or by a certificate of the Security registrar.
The Issuer may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of Registered Securities of any series entitled to vote or consent to any action referred to in Section 7.1, which record date may be set at any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or reconsideration) not more than 60 days nor less than five days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, with respect to Registered Securities of any series, only Holders of Registered Securities of such series of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or revoke such vote or consent.
Section 7.3 . The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Holder of any Unregistered Security and the Holder of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Unregistered Security or Coupon (whether or not such Unregistered Security or Coupon shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes and neither the Issuer, the Trustee, nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his or her order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Unregistered Security or Coupon.
Holders to Be Treated as Owners
Section 7.4 . In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the
Securities Owned by Issuer Deemed Not Outstanding
 
Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described Persons; and, subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Section 7.5 . At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 7.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor or on registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.
Right of Revocation of Action Taken
Section 8.1 . (1) In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by this Indenture, the Issuer, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors (which resolution may provide general terms or parameters for such action and may provide that the specific terms of such action may be determined in accordance with or pursuant to an Order), and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto, which comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as then in effect, without the consent of the Holders, for one or more of the following purposes:
Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Securityholders
(a) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge to the Trustee as security for the Securities of one or more series any property or assets;
(b) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer, or successive successions, and the assumption by the successor Person of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Issuer pursuant to Article IX;
(c) to add to the covenants of the Issuer such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as the Issuer shall consider to be for the benefit of the Holders of Securities or Coupons, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; provided, that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to waive such an Event of Default;
 
(d) to cure any ambiguity, inconsistency, omission or defect to any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture;
(e) to establish the forms or terms of Securities of any series or of the Coupons appertaining to such Securities as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3;
(f) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.11; and
(g) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of affected Securities in any material respect.
(2) The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Issuer in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
(3) Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section may be executed without the consent of the Holders of any of the Securities at the time outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 8.2.
Section 8.2 . (1) With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article VII) of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series affected by such supplemental indenture voting separately, the Issuer and the Trustee may, from time to time and at any time, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto, which comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series or of the Coupons appertaining to such Securities; provided, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the final maturity of any then issued Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof, or make the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), or interest thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in such Securities and any Coupons thereon or in accordance with the terms thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of a then issued Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 5.1 or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy pursuant to Section 5.2, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder to institute suit for the payment thereof or, if such Securities provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the Securityholder, in each case without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (b) reduce the percentage in principal amount of then issued Securities of any series, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Security so affected.
Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Securityholders
(2) A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of Holders of Securities of such series, or of Coupons appertaining to such Securities, with respect to such covenant or provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series or of the Coupons appertaining to such Securities.
(3) Upon the request of the Issuer, accompanied by the Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders of the Securities as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required by Section 7.1, the Trustee shall join with the
 
Issuer in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
(4) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
(5) Promptly after the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Issuer shall give notice thereof (a) if any Registered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof by mailing a notice thereof by first-class mail to such Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security register, (b) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313 (c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, by mailing a notice thereof by first-class mail to such Holders at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee and (c) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to all Holders thereof, by publication of a notice thereof at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in London, and such notice shall set forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Issuer to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
Section 8.3 . Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of Securities of each series affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
Effect of Supplemental Indenture
Section 8.4 . The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall be given, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article VIII complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.
Documents to Be Given to Trustee
Section 8.5 . Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article may bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee for such series as to any matter provided for by such supplemental indenture or as to any action taken by Securityholders. If the Issuer or the Trustee shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Issuer, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such series then Outstanding.
Notation on Securities in Respect of Supplemental Indentures
Section 8.6 . This Indenture may not be amended to alter the subordination of any of the Outstanding Securities without the written consent of each holder of Senior Indebtedness then outstanding that would be adversely affected thereby.

Applicability of Legal Defeasance Provisions; Issuer's Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
 
Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article.
Section 10.4 . Upon the Issuer's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Issuer shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 10.6 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 10.7 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clause (2) of this Section and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 10.6(a) and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 3.2 and 3.3, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Issuer may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 10.5 applied to such Securities. Following a Legal Defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge
Section 10.5 . Upon the Issuer's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Issuer shall be released from its obligations under Article IX, Sections 3.7 and 3.9, inclusive, and any covenants provided pursuant to Sections 2.3(18), 8.1(c) or 8.1(e) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 5.1(4) (with respect to any of Article IX, Sections 3.7 and 3.9, inclusive, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Sections 2.3(18), 8.1(c) or 8.1(e)) and 5.1(8) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 10.6 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 5.1(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.

Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to be Held in Trust

Notices and Demands on Issuer, Trustee and Holders of Securities and Coupons
 
31999, Attn: General Counsel. Any notice, direction, request or demand by the Issuer or any Holder of Securities or Coupons to or upon the Trustee shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given or served by being deposited postage prepaid, first-class mail (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) addressed (until another address of the Trustee is filed by the Trustee with the Issuer) to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 900 Ashwood Parkway, Suite 425, Atlanta, GA, 30338, Attn: Corporate Trust Administration.
Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Registered Securities, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) by electronic means or in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder entitled thereto, at his or her last address as it appears in the Security register. In any case where notice to such Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Issuer when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.
Section 11.5 . Upon any application or demand by the Issuer to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.
Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel; Statements to Be Contained Therein
Each certificate or opinion provided for in this Indenture and delivered to the Trustee with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include (1) a statement that the person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition, (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based, (3) a statement that, in the opinion of such person, he or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with and (4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition or covenant has been complied with.
Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Issuer, upon the certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer or officers of the Issuer, unless such counsel actually knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Issuer, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his or
 
her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
Any certificate or opinion of any independent firm of public accountants filed with and directed to the Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is independent.
Section 11.6 . If the date of maturity of interest on or principal of the Securities of any series or any Coupons appertaining thereto or the date fixed for redemption or repayment of any such Security or Coupon shall not be a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the date fixed for redemption, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date.
Payments Due on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays
Section 11.7 . If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by, or with another provision (an "incorporated provision") included in this Indenture by operation of, Sections 310 to 318, inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, such imposed duties or incorporated provision shall control.

Effect of Headings
. Unless otherwise specified in an Officer's Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.3 of this Indenture with respect to a particular series of Securities, whenever for purposes of this Indenture any action may be taken by the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series or all series affected by a particular action at the time Outstanding and, at such time, there are Outstanding Securities of any series which are denominated in a coin or currency other than Dollars (including ECUs), then the principal amount of Securities of such series which shall be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of taking such action shall be that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such amount at the Market Exchange Rate. For purposes of this Section 11.11, "Market Exchange Rate" shall mean the noon Dollar buying rate in New York City for cable transfers of that currency as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; provided, however, in the case of ECUs, Market Exchange Rate shall mean the rate of exchange determined by the Commission of the European Communities (or any successor thereto) as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (such publication or any successor publication, the "Journal"). If such Market Exchange Rate is not available for any reason with respect to such currency, the Trustee shall use, in its sole discretion and without liability on its part, such quotation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or, in the case of ECUs, the rate of exchange as published in the Journal, as of the most recent available date, or quotations or, in the case of ECUs, rates of exchange from one or more major banks in The City of New York or in the country of issue of the currency in question, which for purposes of the ECU shall be Brussels, Belgium, or such other quotations or, in the case of ECU, rates of exchange as the Trustee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply in determining the equivalent principal amount in respect of Securities of a series denominated in a currency other than Dollars in connection with any action taken by
Securities in a Foreign Currency or in ECU
 
Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of this Indenture including without limitation any determination contemplated in Section 5.1(7).
All decisions and determinations of the Trustee regarding the Market Exchange Rate or any alternative determination provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive to the extent permitted by law for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Issuer and all Holders.
Section 11.12 . The Issuer agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (1) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of or interest on the Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered, unless such day is not a Business Day, then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the Business Day preceding the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered and (2) its obligations under this Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (a) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with subsection (1)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (b) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable and (c) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Indenture.
Judgment Currency
Section 11.13 . If any provision of this Indenture or of the Securities, or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of this Indenture or of the Securities, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to whom or which it is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Separability Clause
Section 11.14 . In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
Force Majeure
Section 12.1 . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article
Section 12.2 . Notice of redemption to the Holders of Registered Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Issuer shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the registry books. Notice of redemption to the Holders of Unregistered Securities to be redeemed as a whole or in part shall be given
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
 
by electronic means. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall identify the securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers), shall specify, the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities and, in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, of all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request and provision of the notice information, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer.
On or before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.3) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Issuer prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section, an Officer's Certificate stating that such restriction has been complied with.
If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such Series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 12.3 . If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto shall be void, and, except as provided in Sections 3.3 and 6.5, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, together
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
 
with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that payment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, to the Holders of the Coupons for such interest upon surrender thereof, and in the case of Registered Securities, to the Holders of such Registered Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Sections 2.3 and 2.7 hereof.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by such Security.
If any Security with Coupons attached thereto is surrendered for redemption and is not accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing after the date fixed for redemption, such Security may be redeemed after deducting from the redemption price any amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Issuer and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the redemption price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest represented by Coupons shall be payable as provided in Section 2.9 and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3, only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons.
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
Section 12.4 . Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.
Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption
Section 12.5 . (1) The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date."
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
(2) In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
 
(3) On or before the 30th day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate (which need not contain the statements required by Section 11.5) (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series and the basis for such credit, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such Officer's Certificate (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such Officer's Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such 30th day, to deliver such Officer's Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
(4) If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) or a lesser sum in Dollars (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) if the Issuer shall so request with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 12.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for redemption under this Section if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such Officer's Certificate as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 12.2 (and with the effect provided in Section 12.3) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity.
(5) On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
 
(6) The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or give any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the giving of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article V and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10 or the default cured on or before the 30th day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
Section 13.1 . The Issuer, for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security or Coupon, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that the payment of the principal of and interest on, each and all of the Securities and any Coupons is hereby expressly subordinated, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter in this Article XIII set forth, in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.
Agreement to Subordinate
Section 13.2 .
Rights of Senior Indebtedness in the Event of Insolvency, Etc. of the Issuer
(1) In the event of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, and any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceedings in connection therewith, relative to the Issuer or to its creditors, as such, or to its property, and in the event of any proceedings for voluntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Issuer, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, and in the event of any execution sale, then the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of principal thereof and interest due thereon (including, without limitation, except to the extent, if any, prohibited by mandatory provisions of law, post-petition interest in any such proceedings) in money or money's worth of all Senior Indebtedness before the Holders are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities or of the Coupons, and to that end the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive for application in payment thereof any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash or property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in connection with any such proceedings or sale in respect of the principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons other than securities of the Issuer as reorganized or readjusted or securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in this Article XIII with respect to the Securities or Coupons, to the payment of all indebtedness of the nature of Senior Indebtedness, provided that the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not altered by such reorganization or readjustment;
(2) In the event and during the continuation of any default in payment of any Senior Indebtedness or if any event of default, as therein defined, shall exist under any Senior Indebtedness or any agreement pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness is issued, no payment of the principle of or interest on the Securities or Coupons shall be made and the Issuer covenants that it will, upon ascertaining any such default or event of default, provide written notice to the Trustee of such default or event of default;
(3) In the event that the Securities of any series are declared due and payable before their expressed maturity because of the occurrence of an Event of Default (under circumstances when the provisions of Subsection (1) of this Section 13.2 shall not be applicable), the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full in money or money's worth of such Senior
 
Indebtedness before such Holders are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons; and
(4) No holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be prejudiced in his or her right to enforce subordination of the Securities or Coupons by any act or failure to act on the part of the Issuer.
Section 13.3 . In the event that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.2, any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than securities of the Issuer as reorganized or readjusted or securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in this Article XIII with respect to the Securities or Coupons, to the payment of all indebtedness of the nature of Senior Indebtedness, provided that the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not altered by such reorganization or readjustment) shall be received by the Holders or by the Trustee for their benefit in connection with any proceedings or sale referred to in Subsection (1) of Section 13.2 before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in money or money's worth, such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of the Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

From and after the payment in full in money or money's worth of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders (together with the holders of any other indebtedness of the Issuer which is subordinate in right of payment to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, which is not subordinate in right of payment to the Securities or Coupons and which by its terms grants such right of subrogation to the holder thereof) shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets or securities of the Issuer applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the Securities and any Coupons shall be paid in full, and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no such payments or distributions to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of assets or securities, which otherwise would have been payable or distributable to Holders, shall, as between the Issuer, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders, be deemed to be a payment by the Issuer to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of this Article XIII are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand, and nothing contained in this Article XIII or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities or Coupons is intended to or shall impair as between the Issuer, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders, the obligation of the Issuer, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to the Holders the principal of and interest on the Securities or Coupons as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or to affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Issuer other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the holder of any Security or Coupon from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture subject to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, under Section 13.2, to receive cash, property or securities of the Issuer otherwise payable or deliverable to the holders of the Securities or Coupons.
Upon any distribution or payment in connection with any proceedings or sale referred to in Subsection (1) of Section 13.2, the Trustee, subject as between the Trustee and the Holders to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2 hereof, shall be entitled to rely upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution or payment to the Trustee for the purpose of ascertaining the holders of Senior Indebtedness entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the amount of such Senior Indebtedness or the amount payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XIII. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Section 13.3,
 
the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, as to the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, and as to other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Section 13.3, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
The Trustee, however, shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall in good faith, mistakenly or otherwise, pay over or distribute to Holders or the Issuer or any other Person moneys or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of Article XIII of this Indenture or otherwise. With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants or obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.
Section 13.4 . Nothing contained in this Article XIII or elsewhere in this Indenture, or in any of the Securities or in any Coupon, shall prevent at any time, (1) the Issuer from making payments at any time of principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons, except under the conditions described in Section 13.2 or during the pendency of any proceedings or sale therein referred to, provided, however, that payments of principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons shall only be made by the Issuer within three Business Days of the due dates for such payments or (2) the application by the Trustee of any moneys deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons, if at the time of such deposit the Trustee did not have written notice in accordance with Section 13.6 of any event prohibiting the making of such deposit by the Issuer or if in the event of redemption, the Trustee did not have such written notice prior to the time that the notice of redemption pursuant to Section 12.2 was given (which notice of redemption shall in no event be given more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption).
Payments to Holders
Section 13.5 . Each Holder by his or her acceptance of a Security or Coupon authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article XIII and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of the Issuer (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise) tending towards liquidation of the business and assets of the Issuer, the immediate filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of such Holder's Securities or Coupons in the form required in said proceedings and cause said claim to be approved.
Holders of Securities Authorize Trustee to Effectuate Subordination of Securities
Section 13.6 . Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XIII or any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with the knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to the Trustee, unless and until the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Issuer or from the holder or the representative of any class of Senior Indebtedness; provided, however, that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such monies may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of either the cash amount payable at maturity or interest on any Security or Coupon), the Trustee shall not have received with respect to such monies the notice provided for in this Section 13.6, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such monies and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary, which may be received by it on or after such two Business Days prior to such date.
Notice to Trustee
Section 13.7 . Subject to the provisions of Section 6.13, the Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article XIII with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent of its right as such holder.
Trustee May Hold Senior Indebtedness
 
Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.6.
Section 13.8 . In case at any time any paying agent other than the Trustee shall be appointed by the Issuer and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article XIII in such case (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including such paying agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such paying agent were named in this Article XIII in place of the Trustee.

WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore entered into a Subordinated Indenture, dated as of September 26, 2012 (the "Original Indenture"), with the Trustee;
WHEREAS, the Original Indenture is incorporated herein by reference, and the Original Indenture, as supplemented by this First Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the "Indenture";

There are to be authenticated and delivered Subordinated Debentures, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,000,000 (or up to $517,500,000 if the

Any such additional Subordinated Debentures and the Subordinated Debentures established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Subordinated Debentures shall be issued in fully registered form.

Section 1.03 . The principal of the Subordinated Debentures shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 5.50% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from September 26, 2012. Subject to Section 1.04 below, Interest shall be paid quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on December 15, 2012, to the Person in whose name the Subordinated Debentures are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a date of redemption as provided herein, will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
Payment of Principal and Interest
Payments of interest on the Subordinated Debentures will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Subordinated Debentures shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Subordinated Debentures is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a date of redemption for, the Subordinated Debentures shall be made upon surrender of the Subordinated Debentures at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Subordinated Debentures shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Section 1.04 . So long as no Event of Default with respect to the Subordinated Debentures has occurred or is continuing, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on the
Option to Defer Interest Payments
 
Subordinated Debentures for one or more Optional Deferral Period (as defined below) of up to five consecutive years, provided, however, that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Maturity Date, any earlier accelerated maturity date arising from an Event of Default or any other earlier redemption of the Subordinated Debentures. If the Company has paid all deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) on the Subordinated Debentures, the Company shall have the right to elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 1.04.
During any Optional Deferral Period, interest shall continue to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures, and deferred interest payments shall accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate on the Subordinated Debentures, compounded quarterly as of each Interest Payment Date to the extent permitted by applicable law. No interest otherwise due during an Optional Deferral Period shall be due and payable on the Subordinated Debentures until the end of such Optional Deferral Period except upon an acceleration or redemption of the debentures during such deferral period.
At the end of any Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) on the Subordinated Debentures to the Persons in whose names the Subordinated Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Optional Deferral Period.
At the end of five years following the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including compounded interest thereon, and the Company's failure to pay all such accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including compounded interest thereon, for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of such five-year period shall result in an Event of Default giving rise to a right of acceleration. If, at the end of any Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall have paid all deferred interest due on the Subordinated Debentures, including compounded interest, the Company may again defer interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures as described above.
"Optional Deferral Period" means the period commencing on an Interest Payment Date with respect to which the Company defers interest pursuant to this Section 1.04 and ending on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of that Interest Payment Date and (ii) the next Interest Payment Date on which the Company has paid all deferred and unpaid amounts (including compounded interest on such deferred amounts) and all other accrued interest on the Subordinated Debentures.
The Company shall give written notice of its election to commence or continue any Optional Deferral Period to the Trustee and the Holders of the Subordinated Debentures at least one Business Day and not more than 60 Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date. Such notice shall be given to the Trustee and each Holder of Subordinated Debentures at such Holder's address by first-class mail, postage prepaid. In addition, the Company's failure to pay interest on the Subordinated Debentures on any Interest Payment Date will itself constitute the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period unless the Company pays such interest within five Business Days after any such Interest Payment Date, whether or not the Company provides a notice of deferral.
 
After the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period and until the Company has paid all accrued and unpaid interest on the Subordinated Debentures, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of the Company's capital stock other than:
(a) purchases or acquisitions of shares of the Company's capital stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors, consultants or agents or the Company's satisfaction of its obligations under any dividend reinvestment plan;
(b) purchases or acquisitions of shares of the Company's capital stock in connection with the Company's satisfaction of its obligations under any contract or security entered into before commencement of the Optional Deferral Period;
(c) as a result of a reclassification of any series or class of the Company's capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for or into another class or series of the Company's capital stock;
(d) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to an acquisition or the conversion or exchange provisions of that capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged;
(e) dividends or distributions of the Company's capital stock, or rights to acquire capital stock, or repurchases or redemptions of capital stock, in each case solely from the issuance or exchange of capital stock;
(f) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan, or issuances of capital stock under any such plan in the future, or redemptions or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan; or
(g) acquisitions of the Company's capital stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses made by the Company (which acquisitions are made by the Company in connection with the satisfaction of indemnification obligations of the sellers of such businesses).
In addition, after the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period until the Company has paid all accrued and unpaid interest on the Subordinated Debentures, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any of the Company's debt securities or guarantees that rank equally with the Subordinated
 
Debentures ("Parity Securities") or junior to the Subordinated Debentures other than (i) any payment of current or deferred interest on Parity Securities made pro rata to the amounts due on such Parity Securities (including the Subordinated Debentures) and any payments of deferred interest on Parity Securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Parity Securities or (ii) any payment of principal on Parity Securities necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing such Parity Securities.

The Subordinated Debentures will initially be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary (which initially shall be The Depository Trust Company) or its nominee. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Subordinated Debentures represented by Global Securities will not be exchangeable for, and will not otherwise be issuable as, Subordinated Debentures in definitive form. The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee.
Global Securities
Owners of beneficial interests in such Global Securities will not be considered the holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and no Global Security representing a Subordinated Debentures shall be exchangeable, except for another Global Security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or to a successor Depositary or its nominee. The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Subordinated Debentures registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Subordinated Debentures registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.
Section 1.07 . No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Subordinated Debentures, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

"Treasury Rate" means (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities", for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the quarterly equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Subordinated Debentures to September 26, 2017, to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Subordinated Debentures to September 26, 2017.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any date of redemption for the Subordinated Debentures (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer
 
Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.

LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.

On and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures or any portion of the Subordinated Debentures called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption amount.
Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof.

The Trustee may select Subordinated Debentures and portions of Subordinated Debentures in amounts of $25 and whole multiples of $25 in excess of $25.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
 
This is one of the 5.50% Subordinated Debentures due 2052 referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This debenture (the "Debenture") represents one of a duly authorized issue of Subordinated Debentures of the Company issued and issuable in one or more series under a Subordinated Indenture dated as of September 26, 2012 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 26, 2012 (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures incidental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Subordinated Debentures (as defined below) issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Subordinated Debentures are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Securities represented by this Debenture are one of the series designated on the face hereof as 5.50% Subordinated Debentures due 2052 (the "Subordinated Debentures"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,000,000 (or to $517,500,000 if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Subordinated Debentures pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement (as defined in Section 1.02 of the First Supplemental Indenture)); provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Subordinated Debentures, as provided in the First Supplemental Indenture. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
So long as no Event of Default (as defined in Section 1.12 of the First Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the Subordinated Debentures has occurred or is continuing, the Company shall have the right, pursuant to Section 1.04 of the First Supplemental Indenture, at any time and from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures for one or more consecutive interest periods that do not exceed five years for any single Optional Deferral Period, subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
This Debenture is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Subordinated Debentures of this series in definitive registered form only as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Subordinated Debentures shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Subordinated Debentures may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, Event of Default is defined in Section 1.12 of the First Supplemental Indenture, which amends and restates in its entirety Section 5.1 of the Original Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Subordinated Debentures under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Subordinated Debentures, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
 
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Debenture shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Debenture and of any Subordinated Debentures issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Debenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Debenture and (ii) restrictive covenants upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Debenture.
The Subordinated Debentures will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in $25 increments:
 
 
 
"Tax Event" means that the Company will have received an opinion of counsel, rendered by a law firm of nationally recognized standing that is experienced in such matters, stating that, as a result of any:
 
 
 
 
which amendment or change is enacted or effective or which pronouncement or decision is announced or which challenge is asserted against the Company or becomes publicly known on or after the original issue date of the Subordinated Debentures, there is more than an insubstantial increase in the risk that interest accruable or payable by the Company on the Subordinated Debentures is not, or will not be, deductible by the Company in whole or in part, for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
"Rating Agency Event" means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that then publishes a rating for the Company (a "rating agency") amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as the Subordinated Debentures, which amendment, clarification or change results in (a) the shortening of the length of time the Subordinated Debentures are assigned a particular level of equity credit by that rating agency as compared to the length of time they would have been assigned that level of equity credit by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of the Subordinated Debentures; or (b) the lowering of the equity credit (including up to a lesser amount) assigned to the Subordinated Debentures by that rating agency compared to the equity credit assigned by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of the Subordinated Debentures.
"Treasury Rate" means (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities", for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the quarterly equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Subordinated Debentures to September 26, 2017, to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Subordinated Debentures to September 26, 2017.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their successors, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any date of redemption for the Subordinated Debentures (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their respective successors and one other primary U.S. government securities dealer (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
On and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures or any portion of the Subordinated Debentures called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption amount.
Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
The Company shall notify the Trustee of the redemption price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said redemption price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
If less than all of the Subordinated Debentures are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall determine, in such manner as it deems appropriate and fair, the principal amount of such Subordinated Debentures held by each beneficial owner of such Subordinated Debentures to be redeemed. The Trustee may select Subordinated Debentures and portions of Subordinated Debentures in amounts of $25 and whole multiples of $25 in excess thereof.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest, other than as described in Section 1.04 of the First Supplemental Indenture, on this Debenture at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Debenture is registrable in the Security register, upon surrender of this Debenture for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Subordinated Debentures, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Debenture for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Subordinated Debenture on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Debenture is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Debenture be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Subordinated Debentures are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Subordinated Debentures are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Debentures of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Subordinated Debenture or Subordinated Debentures to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Debenture, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Debenture shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Debenture shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the state of New York.
 
The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription on the face of this instrument, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations:

(d) an executed copy of the Indenture; and
(e) the global certificate evidencing the Debentures in the form executed and delivered by the Company to the Trustee for authentication and delivery (the "Debenture Certificate").
We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such records of the Company, and such agreements, certificates and receipts of public officials, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company and others, and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth below.

below, the validity and binding effect thereof on such parties. We have also assumed that the Company has been duly organized and is validly existing in good standing, and has requisite legal status and legal capacity, under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and that the Company has complied and will comply with all aspects of the laws of all relevant jurisdictions (including the laws of the State of Georgia) in connection with the transactions contemplated by, and the performance of its obligations under, the Transaction Documents, other than the laws of the State of New York insofar as we express our opinion herein. We have also assumed that the terms of the Debentures have been established so as not to, and that the execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder, do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its properties are subject (except that we do not make the assumption set forth in this clause (i) with respect to those agreements and instruments which are listed in Part II of the Registration Statement or the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K), (ii) any law, rule, or regulation to which the Company or any of its properties are subject (except that we do not make the assumption set forth in this clause (ii) with respect to the Opined on Law (as defined below)), (iii) any judicial or regulatory order or decree of any governmental authority or (iv) any consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, any governmental authority. As to any facts material to the opinion expressed herein that we did not independently establish or verify, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers, trustees and other representatives of the Company, and others.
Our opinions set forth herein are limited to those laws of the State of New York, in each case, that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined on Law"). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such Opined on Law on the opinions herein stated.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that, assuming the Debentures have been duly authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Debentures will constitute valid and

binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
The opinion set forth above is subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
(i) the opinion stated herein is limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, preference and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law); and
(ii) to the extent the opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions contained in any Transaction Agreement, our opinion stated herein is rendered solely in reliance upon New York General Obligations Law sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 and Rule 327(b) of New York Civil Practice Law and Rules and are subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by, in each case, the terms of such sections 5-1401 and 5-1402, as well as by principles of public policy, comity or constitutionality.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, dated the date hereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion with respect to the U.S. federal income tax classification of the 5.50% Subordinated Debentures ("") issued by Aflac Incorporated, a Georgia corporation (the ""), on September 26, 2012, as more fully described in the prospectus supplement dated September 21, 2012 (the ""), to the base prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-181089) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2012.
Debentures
Company
Prospectus Supplement
 
 
The Debentures incorporate the following key terms.
 
The Debentures have a maturity of 40 years.
The Debentures are subordinated to all of the Company's senior indebtedness on the terms set forth in the subordinated indenture pursuant to which the debentures will be issued (the ""), and the Debentures rank pari passu with trade creditors and other subordinated indebtedness expressly stated to rank pari passu with the Debentures.
Subordinated Indenture
 
The Debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to 5.50%, payable quarterly in arrears. The Company may, so long as there is no event of default under the Subordinated Indenture, elect to defer interest payments on the Debentures for one or more consecutive interest periods at any time for up to 5 years (""). Interest may not, however, be deferred beyond the maturity date or the redemption date of the Debentures.
Optional Deferral
During any Optional Deferral, interest will compound quarterly on any interest deferred pursuant to the Optional Deferral right and the Company will generally be prohibited from (i) paying dividends on any class of its equity, or redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of Company capital stock, (ii) paying principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repaying, repurchasing or redeeming any other classes of Company debt securities that rank equally with or junior to the Debentures (other than payments that if not made would cause a breach of the terms of such instruments) or (iii) making any guarantee payments with respect to the securities described in (ii).
 
The Debentures are redeemable or otherwise repayable by the Company, in whole or in part, after September 26, 2017, for cash at the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures to be redeemed plus accumulated and unpaid interest on a compounded basis, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company.
 
The Company may redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, from the date of issuance until September 26, 2017 at any time within 90 days after there is a Tax Event (as defined below), in cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accumulated and unpaid interest on a compounded basis. A Tax Event occurs if, as a result of (a) a change in the tax law or any interpretation thereof, (b) a threatened challenge asserted in connection with an audit of the Company or (c) a threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the Debentures, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest paid or accrued on the Debentures is not deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
The Company may redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, from the date of issuance until September 26, 2017 at any time within 90 days after a Rating Agency Event (as defined below), in cash at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures being redeemed, and (b) the present value of the scheduled remaining payments through September 26, 2017, discounted at a rate equal to a applicable treasury rate, plus 40 basis points. A Rating Agency Event means a change to the methodology or criteria that were employed by an applicable rating agency for purposes of assigning equity credit to securities such as the Debentures on the date of initial issuance of the Debentures, which change either (i) shortens the period of time during which equity credit pertaining to the Debentures would have been in effect or (ii) reduces the amount of equity credit assigned to the Debentures by the applicable rating agency.
 
The Debentures will have no voting rights in the Company.
 
The Company's failure to pay principal or interest on the Debentures when due and the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization will result in a default on the Debentures. In addition, failures to observe or perform any other covenant or obligation in the indenture for 90 days after notice, or failure to make certain other debt payments, may, upon notice from the trustee or holders of 25% of the principal of the Debentures, also constitute an event of default. An event of default will give holders the right to accelerate principal and interest on the Debentures.
 
The Prospectus Supplement and the Subordinated Indenture provide that each holder of the Debentures will be deemed to have agreed to treat the Debentures as indebtedness for all U.S. federal, state and local tax purposes.
The Company has paid regular dividends on its common stock in each of the past 35 years, and the Company has increased dividends every year since 1983. The Company has assets and projected cash flows sufficient to demonstrate that it is capable of servicing the Debentures pursuant to their terms without exercising its right to Optional Deferral. The Company and its subsidiaries have aggregate long term debt liabilities of approximately $3,672 million and shareholders' equity of
 
approximately $14,179 million as of June 30, 2012. The Company and its subsidiaries had net earnings of $1,964 million in 2011, $2,344 million in 2010 and $1,497 in 2009. The Debentures were issued with investment grade debt ratings of Baa1 provided by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and BBB provided by Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
 
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, electronic or facsimile copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed, by the parties indicated therein, we have assumed that each party has, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by each party indicated in the documents and that such documents constitute, or will constitute, valid and binding obligations of each party.
In connection with this opinion (the ""), we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the officer's certificate dated September 26, 2012 (the "") and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the Opinion set forth herein. We have also relied upon statements and representations made to us by representatives of the Company and have assumed that such statements and the facts set forth in such representations are true, correct and complete without regard to any qualification as to knowledge or belief. For purposes of the Opinion stated herein, we have assumed the validity and the initial and continuing accuracy of the documents, certificates, records, statements and representations referred to above. We have also assumed that the transactions related to the offering of the Debentures will be consummated in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus Supplement. Terms used and not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Prospectus Supplement.
Opinion
Officer's Certificate
 
An officer of the Company has provided the following representations in the Officer's Certificate that are relevant to the Opinion:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Generally, the characterization of an instrument as debt or equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance and operation of a particular instrument, and no single factor or characteristic is considered to be controlling.
1
There is no controlling authority directly on point dealing with debentures that have terms similar to the Debentures.
Based on and subject to the description of the facts, assumptions, representations, and analysis set forth herein and in the Prospectus Supplement, it is our opinion that under current U.S. federal income tax law, the Debentures will constitute indebtedness of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In rendering our Opinion, we have considered applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (the ""), pertinent judicial authorities, rulings of the Internal Revenue Service (the ""), and such other
Code
Treasury Regulations
Service
 
 
authorities as we have considered relevant. It should be noted that such laws, Code, Treasury Regulations, judicial decisions, administrative interpretations and such other authorities are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A change in any of the authorities upon which our advice is based could affect our conclusions herein. There can be no assurance that our Opinion will be accepted by the Service or, if challenged, by a court.
Except as set forth above, we express no other opinion. This Opinion has been prepared for you in connection with the filing of the Prospectus Supplement. It may not be relied upon by anyone else without our prior written consent. We consent to the Company filing this Opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission. This Opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our Opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
