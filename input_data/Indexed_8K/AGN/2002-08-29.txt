     This Amendment No. 1 to Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 1, 2002 filed by Allergan, Inc. ("Allergan" or the "Company") to include additional required information as well as required pro forma financial information of the Company.
Item 2. Acquisition Or Disposition Of Assets
     On June 29, 2002, the Company completed the spin-off of its optical medical device business to holders of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, by means of the distribution (the "Distribution") to such holders of all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Advanced Medical Optics, Inc., then a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of the Company ("AMO"), including the preferred stock purchase rights associated with such common stock (collectively, "AMO Common Stock"). In connection with the spin-off, AMO began operations as an independent, separately traded, publicly-held company and is no longer owned by the Company.
     The Distribution was made without the payment of any consideration or the exchange of any shares by the Company's stockholders. In the Distribution, the Company's stockholders received one share of AMO Common Stock for every 4.5 shares of common stock of the Company owned on the record date, June 14, 2002. Ownership of AMO Common Stock was registered in book-entry form. Fractional shares of AMO Common Stock were not issued to the Company's stockholders as part of the Distribution or credited to book-entry accounts. Fractional shares of AMO Common Stock to which the Company's stockholders would otherwise be entitled were aggregated and sold in the public market by the distribution agent. The aggregate cash net proceeds of the sales was distributed ratably to those stockholders who would otherwise have received the fractional shares of AMO Common Stock.
     In connection with the Distribution, AMO Common Stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. "When-issued" trading in AMO Common Stock commenced on The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on June 12, 2002 under the trading symbol "AVO WI." AMO Common Stock began trading "regular way" on the NYSE on July 1, 2002 under the trading symbol "AVO."
     In connection with the Distribution, the Company and AMO entered into a Contribution and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Sharing Agreement, a Transitional Services Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement and a Manufacturing Agreement, all of which are described in AMO's Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended (File No. 001-31257) (the "AMO Form 10"). Forms of each agreement, other than the Manufacturing Agreement, have been filed as exhibits to the AMO Form 10. A form of the Manufacturing Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by AMO with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 25, 2002. The Company is not aware of any material relationship between AMO and the Company or any of its affiliates, any director or officer of the Company or any associate of any such director or officer that existed at the date of the Distribution, except as disclosed in the AMO Form 10.
