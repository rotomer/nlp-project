Excluding sales of non-pharmaceutical products, net sales were up 14.6 percent at constant currency, compared with net sales from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2002.
Including the effect of an unrealized non-cash loss on the mark-to-market adjustment to foreign currency derivative instruments of $0.8 million pre-tax, or $0.01 per share on an after-tax basis, Allergan reported $0.53 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter ended March 28, 2003, a 76.7 percent increase over the $0.30 diluted earnings per share reported in the same quarter of 2002.

The 2002 earnings per share amount excludes non-recurring items totaling $0.15 per share.

This lower research and development expense as a percentage of net sales ratio was principally driven by the timing of key research and development programs.
Additional Financial Highlights
At March 28, 2003, Allergan's stockholders' equity was $887.6 million. Cash and equivalents were $878.3 million. Allergan had cash net of debt of $257.7 million.

Allergan's Board of Directors has authorized management to exercise the acquisition option for Bardeen Sciences Company, LLC, which is subject to additional Federal Trade Commission approval. The acquisition will occur through the exercise of a previously granted equity purchase option that became operable as a result of the implications of the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46. The option uses a set formula to determine the option purchase price, which is anticipated to be between approximately $250 and $260 million. Based on a preliminary valuation and in-process research and development study performed by an independent third party, Allergan anticipates that it will write-off substantially all of the purchase price as in-process research and development in the second quarter of 2003. This accounting treatment has been reviewed by Allergan's independent auditors, KPMG LLP. As a result of this transaction, Allergan anticipates research and development as a percentage of sales will be between 17.5 and 18.0 percent for the full year 2003, excluding the anticipated effect from the write-off of in-process research and development. Allergan currently intends to continue development of the key projects within Bardeen, including Tazarotene oral for the treatment of acne, a Lumigan/Timolol combination, Androgen Tears and Memantine.
Bardeen Sciences Company, LLC
For the second quarter of 2003, Allergan estimates total worldwide sales, including contract sales to AMO, between $415 million and $435 million. Due to the partial quarter anticipated effect of the Bardeen programs, Allergan estimates diluted earnings per share before non-recurring items in the second quarter of $0.52. For the third quarter of 2003, due to the first full quarter impact of the additional research and development programs, Allergan estimates diluted earnings per share growth before non-recurring items of approximately 18.0 percent.
Outlook
 
5-5-5
Allergan is forecasting income statement ratios for the full year 2003 as follows: consolidated gross profit, including contract sales, of approximately 81.5 percent, SG&A expenses of approximately 39 percent, and research and development expenses of approximately 17.5 to 18.0 percent. Diluted earnings per share guidance is $2.31 excluding non-recurring items, or the high end of the range provided in January 2003. This includes the ongoing impact of the Bardeen Sciences Company acquisition but excludes any one-time write-offs associated with in-process research and development, marketing rights and other items associated with the Bardeen transaction that are expected to occur in the second quarter of 2003. Full year sales guidance remains unchanged from what was provided in January.
In this press release, the statements regarding the outlook for Allergan's earnings per share and revenue forecasts, statements from Mr. Pyott and statements regarding anticipated product approvals, among other statements above, are forward-looking statements. Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Allergan's performance at times differs from its estimates and targets, and Allergan often does not know what the actual results will be until after a quarter's end and year's end. Therefore, Allergan will not report or comment on its progress during the quarter. Any statement made by others with respect to progress mid-quarter cannot be attributed to Allergan.

All forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Allergan's current analysis of existing trends and information and represent Allergan's judgment only as of the date of this press release. Actual results may differ from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses, including, among other things, changing competitive, market and regulatory conditions; the timing and uncertainty of the results of both the research and development and regulatory processes; domestic and foreign health care and cost containment reforms; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; the performance, including the approval, introduction and consumer acceptance of new products and the continuing acceptance of currently marketed products; the effectiveness of advertising and other promotional campaigns; the timely and successful implementation of strategic initiatives; the uncertainty associated with the identification of and successful consummation and execution of external corporate development initiatives and strategic partnering transactions; and Allergan's ability to obtain and successfully maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand in a timely manner.
