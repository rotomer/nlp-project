INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Board of Directors Bardeen Sciences Company, LLC:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Bardeen Sciences Company, LLC (a development stage company) (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002, and the related statements of operations, member's equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended, and for the period from March 20, 2001 (date of inception) to December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The Company's financial statements for the period from March 20, 2001 (date of inception) through December 31, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors in their report dated January 18, 2002 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. The financial statements for the period March 20, 2001 (date of inception) to December 31, 2001 reflect total operating expenses of $131,048,071 and net loss of $130,280,616 of the related totals. The other auditors' report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for such prior period, is based solely on the report of such other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors, such 2002 financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, and for the period from March 20, 2001 (date of inception) to December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company has outsourced all of its research and development to Allergan Inc., a related party.

On May 16, 2003 Allergan acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Bardeen, a development stage company organized to research, develop, test, license, produce and market various pharmaceutical products derived from certain unproven compounds, products and technologies, for an aggregate cash purchase price of $263.1 million.
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of March 28, 2003 presents the unaudited pro forma financial condition of Allergan as if Allergan had acquired Bardeen as of March 28, 2003. The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of earnings for the three months ended March 28, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 present unaudited pro forma operating results for Allergan as if Allergan had acquired Bardeen as of January 1, 2002.
The unaudited pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred had the acquisition been consummated at the dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position of Allergan following the acquisition. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma financial information presented does not consider any future events that may occur after the date of the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma financial information presented does not attempt to quantify any operating expense synergies or cost reductions of the combined operations of Allergan and Bardeen that may be realized after the date of the acquisition. Nor does the unaudited pro forma financial information consider the incremental expense or capital costs that may be incurred as a result of the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements, including the notes thereto, are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should be read in conjunction with, the historical financial statements of Allergan in Allergan's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2003, Allergan's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and the audited and unaudited financial statements of Bardeen presented in Item 7(a) above.

The pro forma financial statements and related notes give effect to the acquisition accounted for as a purchase of net assets. The pro forma balance sheet has been prepared as if the acquisition was completed as of March 28, 2003 and the pro forma statements of earnings have been prepared as if the acquisition was completed on January 1, 2002. The acquisition was consummated on May 16, 2003.
All interim financial data used to develop the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of March 28, 2003 and statements of earnings for the three months ended March 28, 2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2002 are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring entries) for a fair presentation thereof.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of earnings for the three months ended March 28, 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2002 are not necessarily indicative of operating results which would have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated on January 1, 2002 and should not be construed as representative of future earnings.
Under purchase accounting, the total acquisition cost was allocated to Bardeen's assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values as of March 28, 2003. The final purchase price allocations as of May 16, 2003 will differ from the amounts reflected herein due to expected changes in Bardeen's net tangible assets from March 31, 2003 to May 16, 2003. Allergan's pro forma analysis at March 28, 2003 resulted in an allocation of $263.2 million to in-process research and development, which, under generally accepted accounting principles, would be expensed immediately after the acquisition was completed and, therefore, has been reflected as an adjustment, net of tax, to retained earnings at March 28, 2003. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of earnings for the three months ended March 28, 2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2002 exclude the pro forma $263.2 million pre-tax write-off of in-process research and development.
