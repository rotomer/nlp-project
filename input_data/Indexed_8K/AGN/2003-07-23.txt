ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS
ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE (FURNISHED UNDER ITEM 12)
     Allergan, Inc. ("Allergan") is furnishing the information in this section under "Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure" and "Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition" of this Current Report in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216.
     On July 23, 2003, Allergan issued a press release announcing its operating results for the second quarter ended June 27, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is hereby incorporated to this Item 9 by reference.
     In its press release the Company included historical non-GAAP financial measures with respect to the three and six month periods ended June 27, 2003 and the corresponding periods for 2002, as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allergan believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to investors. The presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
     In the press release, Allergan reported the non-GAAP financial measure "adjusted diluted earnings." Allergan uses adjusted diluted earnings to enhance the investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of Allergan's core business activities. Specifically, Allergan believes that a report of adjusted diluted earnings provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates the comparison of results of core business operations between its current, past and future periods. Adjusted diluted earnings is one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods. Allergan also uses adjusted diluted earnings for evaluating management performance for compensation purposes.
     In the press release, Allergan also reported sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency sales. Constant currency sales represent current period reported sales adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year. Allergan calculates the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported amounts, calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year, to the actual current period reported amounts. Management refers to growth rates at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of Allergan's sales. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower, respectively, than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
     Allergan is also holding a webcast and investor conference beginning at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time on July 23, 2003, to disclose its financial results for the second quarter ended June 27, 2003. The webcast can be accessed live through the Allergan website, www.allergan.com. Replays of the webcast will also be available from July 23, 2003 at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time until July 25, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, and can be accessed through www.allergan.com or by calling 1-800-925-4387 for domestic locations, or 1-402-220-4177 for international locations. A passcode will not be required.

In this press release, the statements regarding the outlook for Allergan's earnings per share and revenue forecasts, and statements from Mr. Pyott, among other statements above, are forward-looking statements. Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Allergan's performance at times differs materially from its estimates and targets, and Allergan often does not know what the actual results will be until after a quarter's end and year's end. Therefore, Allergan will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to Allergan.
Forward-Looking Statements
Any other statements in this press release that refer to Allergan's expected, estimated or anticipated future results are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Allergan's current analysis of existing trends and information and represent Allergan's judgment only as of the date of this press release. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses, including among other things, changing competitive market and regulatory conditions; the timing and uncertainty of the results of both the research and development and regulatory processes; domestic and foreign health care and cost containment reforms; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; the performance, including the approval, introduction and consumer and physician acceptance of new products and the continuing acceptance of currently marketed products; the effectiveness of advertising and other promotional campaigns; the timely and successful implementation of strategic initiatives; the results of any pending litigations, investigations or claims; the uncertainty associated with the identification of and successful consummation and execution of external corporate development initiatives and strategic partnering transactions; and Allergan's ability to obtain and successfully maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand in a timely manner. In addition, matters generally affecting the economy, such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates; international relations; and the state of the economy worldwide, can affect Allergan's results. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Allergan expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
