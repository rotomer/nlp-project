EXHIBIT 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(IRVINE, California, July 28, 2004)  Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN) today announced the appointment of Dr. Scott Whitcup to Executive Vice President, Research & Development.
"Allergan's continued success depends upon our ability to fuel our discovery efforts, drive forward our key clinical programs and secure approval for compounds that will meet the needs of physicians and their patients," said David E.I. Pyott, Allergan's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. "I am confident that Dr. Whitcup's leadership skills and expertise will enable him in his efforts to successfully deliver on the many current and future opportunities in our rich portfolio."
Dr. Whitcup joined Allergan in 2000 and has a proven track record of success. He was instrumental in the approval of both LUMIGAN and RESTASIS, two of Allergan's leading ophthalmology products. With extensive research and clinical experience in retinal disease, Dr. Whitcup was also a key strategist for the acquisition and integration of Oculex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This acquisition brought to Allergan both POSURDEX and a revolutionary drug delivery platform to deliver Allergan's innovative compounds directly to the back of the eye.
Prior to joining Allergan, Dr. Whitcup served as the Clinical Director of the National Eye Institute (NEI). At the NEI, Dr. Whitcup's leadership was vital in building the clinical research program and promoting new ophthalmic therapeutic discoveries. Dr. Whitcup graduated from Cornell University and Cornell University Medical College. He completed his residency in internal medicine at UCLA and his residency in ophthalmology at Harvard University.
Dr. Whitcup's proven capabilities will help enable Allegan to not only build its ophthalmic portfolio but also leverage its technology platforms into new specialty therapeutic areas. These efforts include Allergan's preclinical work in alpha agonists for neuropathic pain and a pro-drug for proton pump inhibitors. In addition, Allergan continues to invest in further improvements to BOTOX, as well as in a broad range of clinical development programs such as post-stroke spasticity, headache and overactive bladder.
