Item 4.01. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
On June 24, 2005, Allergan, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP ("KPMG"). On that same date, the Company engaged the services of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as its new independent registered public accounting firm for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2005. The Company's Audit and Finance Committee authorized the dismissal of KPMG and the engagement of Ernst & Young.
The audit reports of KPMG on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that KPMG's audit report on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 contained a separate paragraph stating "as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 04-08, , in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2004 and restated all prior period diluted earnings per share amounts." The audit report of KPMG on management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified.
The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share
In connection with the audits of the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and in the subsequent interim period through June 24, 2005, there were no (1) disagreements between the Company and KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to KPMG's satisfaction, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report, or (2) reportable events described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. A letter from KPMG is attached hereto as Exhibit 16, indicating whether it agrees with the statements herein.
In deciding to select Ernst & Young, the Audit and Finance Committee reviewed auditor independence issues and existing commercial relationships with Ernst & Young and concluded that Ernst & Young has no commercial relationship with the Company that would impair its independence.
During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and the subsequent interim period through June 24, 2005, the Company did not consult with Ernst & Young regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Exhibit 16
June 30, 2005
Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, D.C. 20549
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We were previously principal accountants for Allergan, Inc. (Allergan) and, under the date of March 4, 2005, we reported on the consolidated financial statements of Allergan as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. On June 24, 2005, our appointment as principal accountants was terminated. We have read Allergan's statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K dated June 30, 2005, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with Allergan's statements in the first paragraph that Ernst & Young LLP has been engaged as Allergan's new independent registered public accounting firm and that their engagement and our dismissal was approved by the Audit and Finance Committee, or any of the statements in the fourth and fifth paragraphs under Item 4.01.
Very truly yours,
/s/ KPMG LLP
