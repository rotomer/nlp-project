Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On December 20, 2005, Allergan, Inc. ("Allergan"), Banner Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan ("Merger Sub" or "Offeror") and Inamed Corporation ("Inamed") entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Allergan Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will continue its previously announced offer to exchange for all outstanding shares of Inamed common stock (together with the associated preferred stock purchase rights, the "Inamed Shares") a choice of cash or Allergan common stock, as described below, with such offer amended to conform to the terms set forth in the Allergan Merger Agreement (as amended, the "Offer"). After the completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Inamed (the "Inamed Merger"), with Inamed surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Allergan. A copy of Allergan's and Inamed's joint press release announcing the execution of the Allergan Merger Agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
      Under the Allergan Merger Agreement, as promptly as practicable after the Inamed Merger, Allergan intends to cause Inamed to merge with and into a wholly owned limited liability company subsidiary of Allergan. This second merger is referred to as the "Post-Closing Merger". Immediately before the Post-Closing Merger, Allergan will be the sole stockholder of Inamed, and none of the former Inamed stockholders will have any economic interest in, or approval or other rights with respect to, the Post-Closing Merger.
      The following summary describes certain material provisions of the Allergan Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by this reference. This summary may not contain all of the information about the Allergan Merger Agreement that is important to Inamed stockholders, and Inamed stockholders are encouraged to read the Allergan Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety. The legal rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the specific language of the Allergan Merger Agreement, and not this summary.
The Offer
      The Allergan Merger Agreement provides for the making of the Offer. Under the terms of the Offer, each Inamed stockholder may elect to receive, for each Inamed Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, either:
      in each case, subject to the proration and election procedures described below, and further described in the Allergan Merger Agreement.
     In the Offer, 45% of the aggregate Inamed Shares tendered will be exchanged for cash and 55% of the aggregate Inamed Shares tendered will be exchanged for shares of Allergan common stock. Therefore, elections will be subject to proration if tendering holders of Inamed Shares, in the aggregate, elect to receive more than the maximum amount of consideration to be paid in cash or Allergan common stock pursuant to the Offer.
     Under the Allergan Merger Agreement, the obligation of Offeror to accept for exchange and to exchange Inamed Shares for cash and shares of Allergan common stock tendered pursuant to the Offer is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. These conditions are described under "Conditions of the Offer" below.
      Under the Allergan Merger Agreement, Offeror may extend the Offer:
Conditions of the Offer
      Pursuant to the terms of the Allergan Merger Agreement, Offeror is not required to accept for exchange or exchange any Inamed Shares, may postpone the acceptance for exchange, or exchange, of tendered Inamed Shares, if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the following conditions are not met, and Offeror may, in its reasonable discretion (but subject to the requirements of applicable laws) terminate or amend the Offer in accordance with the Allergan Merger Agreement if, the following conditions are not met:
Table of Contents
      The conditions to the Offer set forth in the Allergan Merger Agreement (i) are for the sole benefit of Offeror, (ii) may be asserted by Offeror regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any of these conditions and (iii) may be waived by Offeror, provided that the conditions described in clauses (c)(i) and (d)(i) through (iii) are not waivable. Under the Allergan Merger Agreement, Inamed must consent before (A) Offeror waives the minimum tender condition described above, (B) Offeror adds any conditions to the Offer, (C) Offeror modifies any condition to the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Inamed Shares or (D) Offeror changes the form of consideration.
Completion and Effectiveness of the Inamed Merger
      The closing of the Inamed Merger will occur on the second business day after all of the conditions to completion of the Inamed Merger contained in the Allergan Merger Agreement, including the condition that the Offer shall have been completed, are satisfied or waived, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing (see "Conditions to the Merger" below). The Inamed Merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

Merger Consideration
      Upon completion of the Inamed Merger, each Inamed Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Inamed Merger will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder (A) $84.00 in cash, without interest, or (B) 0.8498 of a share of Allergan common stock (including the associated preferred stock purchase rights), in each case subject to proration. This consideration will be paid upon surrender of the stock certificate formerly representing the canceled Inamed Shares in the manner provided in the Allergan Merger Agreement. Inamed Shares held by stockholders who validly exercise and perfect appraisal rights will be subject to appraisal in accordance with Delaware law as described further below under "Appraisal Rights."
      The maximum aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to the Inamed Merger will be:
      The maximum aggregate number of shares of Allergan common stock payable pursuant to the Inamed Merger shall be:
      The stock merger consideration, together with the cash merger consideration, are sometimes referred to in this Current Report as the "merger consideration." The percentages of cash and stock consideration also may be subject to adjustments to the extent necessary to protect the treatment of the Offer, the Inamed Merger and the Post-Closing Merger, collectively, as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, as provided in the Allergan Merger Agreement.
      Although Inamed stockholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the Offer, Inamed Shares held by Inamed stockholders who properly demand payment for such shares in compliance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, but instead will be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such stockholder pursuant to Section 262. However, if any Inamed stockholder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to receive payment under Section 262, then that Inamed stockholder will not be paid in accordance with Section 262 and the Inamed Shares held by that Inamed stockholder will be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the merger consideration as set forth in the Allergan Merger Agreement.
Fractional Shares
      Allergan will not issue fractional shares of Allergan common stock in the Offer or the Inamed Merger. Instead, each holder of Inamed Shares who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares of Allergan common stock will be entitled to an amount of cash (without interest) equal to such holders' respective proportionate share of the proceeds from the sale of the aggregate fractional shares of Allergan common stock issued pursuant to the Offer or the Inamed Merger, as the case may be, made in the open market by the exchange agent for the Offer and the Inamed Merger on behalf of all such holders.
Top-Up Option
      Subject to certain terms and conditions in the Allergan Merger Agreement, Offeror has an irrevocable option to purchase up to that number of Inamed Shares equal to the lowest number of Inamed Shares that, when added to the number of Inamed Shares collectively owned by Allergan, Offeror and any of Allergan's other subsidiaries immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute 90% of the Inamed Shares then outstanding (on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to any exercise of the "Top-Up" option) at a purchase price per Inamed Share of $84.00. The purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of Allergan common stock, a promissory note, or a combination thereof.

Conditions to the Merger
      In addition to the completion of the Offer, the respective obligations of Inamed, Allergan and Offeror to complete the Inamed Merger under the Allergan Merger Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

      The Allergan Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties. These include representations and warranties of Inamed with respect to: corporate organization and qualification; capitalization; subsidiaries; authority; SEC filings and financial statements; absence of undisclosed liabilities; litigation; absence of certain changes or events; compliance with laws and permits; material contracts and defaults; taxes; employee benefit plans; labor and employment matters; environmental matters; intellectual property; real property; regulatory compliance; insurance matters; opinion of financial advisors; brokers and finders; foreign corrupt practices and international trade sanctions; and additional representations regarding certain required amendments of the Inamed rights agreement.

The representations and warranties contained in the Allergan Merger Agreement expire at the effective time of the Inamed Merger.
     The representations, warranties and covenants made by the parties in the Allergan Merger Agreement are qualified by information contained in disclosure schedules delivered in connection with the execution of the Allergan Merger Agreement. Stockholders are not third party beneficiaries under the Allergan Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties or any of their affiliates.
No Solicitation of Other Offers by Inamed
      Under the terms of the Allergan Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions described below, Inamed has agreed that it and its subsidiaries, and directors, officers and employees of it and its subsidiaries, will not, directly or indirectly:

      For purposes of the restrictions described above, a "proposal to acquire Inamed" is any offer or proposal with respect to a potential or proposed:
      Under the Allergan Merger Agreement, Inamed is obligated to notify Allergan in writing within 48 hours after receiving any proposal to acquire Inamed or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any proposal to acquire Inamed. The notice must include the material terms and conditions of the potential proposal, and the identity of the person making the proposal. Inamed also must promptly keep Allergan informed of the status and details of the proposal, and must provide Allergan with a copy of all written materials provided in connection with such proposal.
      Notwithstanding the prohibitions described above, if Inamed receives an unsolicited bona fide written proposal to acquire Inamed, made after the Allergan Merger Agreement is executed, Inamed is permitted to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, and provide information to, the party making the proposal to acquire Inamed as long as:
      Prior to providing any information to, or participating in discussions or negotiations with, any person making the proposal to acquire Inamed, Inamed must provide written notice to Allergan and otherwise comply with the notice and information delivery requirements described above.
      A "superior proposal" for purposes of the Allergan Merger Agreement is an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a potential acquirer to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, all or substantially all of the assets of Inamed, or a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of Inamed and as a result of which the stockholders of Inamed immediately preceding the transaction would hold less than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity or its parent or subsidiary, on terms that are more favorable to Inamed's stockholders than the terms of the Offer and the Inamed Merger, taking into account, among other matters, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such offer and the person making the proposal.
      Upon delivering notice to Allergan of Inamed's receipt of a superior proposal, and if requested by Allergan, Inamed must negotiate in good faith with Allergan to revise the terms of the Allergan Merger Agreement to be superior to those in the purportedly superior proposal to acquire Inamed.
Changes of Recommendation
      The Allergan Merger Agreement contemplates that the Inamed board of directors will continue to recommend that Inamed stockholders tender their Inamed Shares pursuant to the Offer and adopt and approve the Allergan Merger Agreement.

Table of Contents
      All outstanding rights that Inamed may hold immediately prior to the effective time of the Inamed Merger to acquire unvested Inamed Shares issued pursuant to the Inamed restricted stock plan will lapse as of the effective time of the Inamed Merger, such that holders of restricted stock will be entitled to receive the merger consideration payable pursuant to the Inamed Merger with respect to their restricted Inamed Shares.
Directors' and Officers' Indemnification
      Under the Allergan Merger Agreement, Allergan will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and will cause Offeror to, honor all of Inamed's obligations to indemnify its current or former directors or officers for acts or omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the effective time of the Inamed Merger.

Allergan Termination Fees

Effect of Termination
      In the event of termination of the Allergan Merger Agreement prior to the effective time of the Inamed Merger in accordance with the terms of the Allergan Merger Agreement, the Allergan Merger Agreement will become void, and there shall be no liability or further obligation on the part of Allergan, Offeror, or Inamed, except to the extent that the termination results from the willful and material breach by a party of the Allergan Merger Agreement, and other than the payment of fees and expenses described above under "Termination Fees and Expenses," certain provisions relating to confidentiality, and certain general provisions which will survive the termination.

None of Allergan, Offeror, Company, or their respective subsidiaries shall take, or agree to take, any action (including any action otherwise permitted by the Allergan Merger Agreement) that could prevent or impede the Inamed Merger, taken together with the Offer and the Post-Closing Merger, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

EXHIBIT 99.1
IRVINE, Calif. and SANTA BARBARA, Calif, December 20, 2005  - Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN) and Inamed Corporation (NASDAQ: IMDC) announced today that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger regarding the acquisition of Inamed by Allergan.
Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement and consistent with the exchange offer previously commenced by Allergan, Allergan will exchange for each outstanding common share of Inamed, either $84 in cash or 0.8498 of a share of Allergan common stock, at the election of the holder. Elections of Inamed stockholders are subject to proration as described in Allergan's Form S-4 initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 21, 2005 and subsequently amended, so that 45% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered will be exchanged for cash and 55% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered will be exchanged for shares of Allergan common stock.
Concurrently, Inamed entered into a termination agreement with Ipsen Ltd. today. Pursuant to the termination agreement, and conditioned upon the consummation of Allergan's acquisition of Inamed, Ipsen will take back its rights to the botulinum toxin product Reloxin, and Inamed and Ipsen will release each other of all obligations under the distribution agreement regarding Reloxin.
"The signing of the merger agreement by both parties marks a significant milestone in the process of combining the two companies and delivering on our vision to create a world leading franchise in the high-growth medical aesthetics arena," said David E.I. Pyott, Allergan's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. "It validates the excellent progress we are making in the transaction. With the execution of a termination agreement regarding Reloxin, we are moving rapidly to clear all regulatory hurdles and obtain Federal Trade Commission and other governmental clearances to consummate the acquisition."
"We are delighted to have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan and look forward to realizing the benefits of the proposed acquisition," added Nicholas L. Teti, Inamed's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We continue to work with the appropriate regulatory authorities as they review the transaction, and do not anticipate that the regulatory process will lead to any material delay in the closing of the transaction."
As previously announced, Inamed's board of directors unanimously determined that the definitive merger agreement and the terms of the Allergan exchange offer specified in the definitive merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Inamed and its stockholders, and recommended that Inamed stockholders tender their Inamed shares to Allergan. Allergan expects to amend the terms of its exchange offer to conform to the terms specified in the definitive merger agreement promptly by making all requisite filings with the SEC.
 
The Allergan exchange offer commenced on November 21, 2005 and is currently scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m. EST, on January 9, 2006, subject to extension or early termination.

Allergan Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements", including, among other statements, statements by Mr. Pyott and Mr. Teti regarding the proposed business combination between Allergan and Inamed. Statements made in the future tense, and words such as "expect", "believe", "will", "may", "anticipate" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, but are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond the control of Allergan. Relevant risks and uncertainties include those referenced in Allergan's filings with the SEC (which can be obtained as described in "Additional Information" below), and include: general industry and pharmaceutical market conditions; general domestic and international economic conditions; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; challenges inherent in product marketing such as the unpredictability of market acceptance for new pharmaceutical and biologic products and/or the acceptance of new indications for such products; uncertainties regarding analysts' and other's projections and estimates for revenues and earnings of Inamed and market growth rates; domestic and foreign health care reforms; the timing and uncertainty of research and development and regulatory processes; trends toward managed care and health care cost containment; and governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations. Risks and uncertainties relating to the proposed business combination transaction include: that required regulatory approvals will not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all; that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction will not be realized; that the integration of Inamed's operations with Allergan will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; and that the proposed transaction will not be
 
consummated. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements, and therefore should be carefully considered.
Inamed Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on management's current estimates and expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements in this press release include, without limitation, express and implied statements regarding the satisfaction of the conditions to closing of the merger as well as the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the merger. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied here. Readers are referred to the documents filed by Inamed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the most recent reports which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Additional risks include but are not limited to: the receipt of required regulatory approvals for the transaction (including the approval of antitrust authorities necessary to complete the merger); the ability to realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of the merger; the ability to timely and cost-effectively integrate Inamed and Allergan's operations; the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries including product liability claims; dependence on sales of key products; the uncertainty of future financial results and fluctuations in operating results; the timing and success of new product development by Allergan, Inamed or third parties; competitive product introductions; and the risks of pending or future litigation. The information contained in this press release is a statement of Inamed's present intention, belief or expectation and is based upon, among other things, the existing regulatory environment, industry conditions, market conditions and prices, the economy in general and Inamed's assumptions. Inamed may change its intention, belief or expectation, at any time and without notice, based upon any changes in such factors, in Inamed's assumptions or otherwise. Inamed undertakes no obligation to review or confirm analysts' expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

          (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation, breach or default under any of the Company Material Contracts, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a violation, breach or default, except for such breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. No written claim has ever been made by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.
          (b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries did not, as of the date of the financial statements contained in the most recent Company SEC Filings, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in such financial statements. Since the date of the financial statements in the most recent Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice, except for any liability for Taxes which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) No deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been set forth or claimed in writing, or proposed or assessed by a Tax authority. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, proposed or threatened audits, investigations, disputes or claims or other actions for or relating to any Liability for Taxes with respect to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and there are no matters under discussion with any Tax authority, or known to the Company, with respect to Taxes that are likely to result in a material additional Liability for Taxes with respect to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No issues relating to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax authority in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be expected to recur with a Company Material Adverse Effect on Taxes in a later taxable period. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of federal, state and local income Tax Returns of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessors for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, and true and complete copies of all examination reports and

          (e) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party, and all Tax Returns (including without limitation all IRS Forms W-2 and 1099) required with respect thereto have been properly completed and timely filed in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has classified any individual as an "independent contractor" or similar non-employee status who, according to any Company Benefit Plan or applicable Law, should have been classified as an employee, except to the extent that the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
          (f) There are no Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements (including indemnity arrangements) with respect to or involving any of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, after the Closing Date, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be bound by any such Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements or have any Liability thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.
          (g) Except for the affiliated group of which the Company is the common parent, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not and has never been a member of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code or any group that has filed a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has Liability for the Taxes of any Person (including an individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, labor union or other entity or Governmental Entity) other than the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor, (iii) by contract, or (iv) otherwise.

          (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or knows of any fact that could be reasonably expected to prevent the Merger, taken together with the Offer and the Second Merger, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
          (j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to a "reportable transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) (other than such transactions that have been properly reported) or to a transaction that is or is substantially similar to a "listed transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2), or any other transaction requiring disclosure under analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law. The Company has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Code Section 6662.

Exhibit 99.3
     IRVINE, Calif., Dec 13, 2005 (BUSINESS WIRE)  Allergan, Inc. (NYSE:AGN) today welcomed the announcement made by the Board of Directors of Inamed Corporation (NASDAQ:IMDC) that the Inamed Board recommends Allergan's offer to acquire Inamed. Earlier in the day, Inamed announced that Inamed and Medicis (NYSE:MRX) had terminated their previously executed merger agreement.
     Pursuant to Allergan's proposed agreement and plan of merger with Inamed (the "Merger Agreement"), and consistent with the exchange offer previously commenced by Allergan, Allergan would exchange for each outstanding common share of Inamed, either $84 in cash or 0.8498 of a share of Allergan common stock, at the election of the holder. Elections of Inamed stockholders are subject to proration as described in Allergan's Form S-4 initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 21, 2005 and subsequently amended, so that 45% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered will be exchanged for cash and 55% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered will be exchanged for shares of Allergan common stock.
     On December 6, 2005 Allergan delivered to Inamed an executed copy of the Merger Agreement accompanied by a written irrevocable offer regarding the execution of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the exchange offer and subsequent merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In accordance with the conditions in the irrevocable offer letter, Inamed (1) has advised Allergan that it will promptly provide Allergan with information relating to its dermal filler product, Juvederm(R), currently in development, and (2) today provided Inamed's definitive disclosure schedules required by the Merger Agreement. Allergan's irrevocable offer is subject to the further condition that the Merger Agreement be executed by Inamed within 24 hours after Allergan notifies Inamed that Allergan is satisfied with the Juvederm(R) information and disclosure schedules provided by Inamed. Upon receipt of the Juvederm(R) information and Inamed's disclosure schedules to the Merger Agreement, Allergan expects that it will be in a position to complete its review within a matter of days.
     "Allergan is delighted that Inamed's Board supports our offer and recommends that Inamed stockholders tender their Inamed shares pursuant to Allergan's exchange offer upon execution of the Merger Agreement. Our companies are making good progress towards completing this transaction," said David E. I. Pyott, Allergan's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We expect to complete our remaining due diligence regarding
 
Juvederm(R) shortly after Inamed delivers the Juvederm(R) information and look forward to a fully executed Merger Agreement shortly thereafter."
     Allergan's exchange offer for outstanding Inamed shares began on November 21, 2005 and will continue until 12:00 midnight EST, on December 20, 2005, subject to extension or early termination. The exchange offer is conditioned, among other things, upon the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law. Allergan intends to extend the offer from time to time until the waiting period has expired. Allergan will provide further guidance on the anticipated closing date of the exchange offer as it continues to work with the FTC on the divestiture of Reloxin(R).
     To learn more about Allergan's proposed offer for Inamed and the details of the transaction, please go to the Allergan website www.Allergan.com.

Forward-Looking Statements
     This press release contains "forward-looking statements", including, among other statements, statements regarding the proposed business combination between Allergan and Inamed. Statements made in the future tense, and words such as "expect", "believe", "will", "may", "anticipate" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, but are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond the control of Allergan. Relevant risks and uncertainties include those referenced in Allergan's filings with the SEC (which can be obtained as described in "Additional Information" below), and include: general industry and pharmaceutical market conditions; general domestic and international economic conditions; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; challenges inherent in product marketing such as the unpredictability of market acceptance for new pharmaceutical and biologic products and/or the acceptance of new indications for such products; uncertainties regarding analysts' and other's projections and estimates for revenues and earnings of Inamed and market growth rates; domestic and foreign health care reforms; the timing and uncertainty of research and development and regulatory processes; trends toward managed care and health care cost containment; and governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations. Risks and uncertainties relating to the proposed business combination transaction include: that required regulatory approvals will not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all; that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction will not be realized; that the integration of Inamed's operations with Allergan will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; and that the proposed transaction will not be consummated. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements, and therefore should be carefully considered.
 
     
Additional Information
     Allergan has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 and a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO in connection with the exchange offer. Inamed stockholders should read those filings, and any other filings made by Allergan with the SEC in connection with the proposed acquisition, as they contain important information. These SEC filings, as well as Allergan's other public SEC filings, can be obtained without charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, and at Allergan's website at www.Allergan.com.

In the offer, Allergan will exchange for each outstanding share of common stock of Inamed, either $84 in cash or 0.8498 of a share of Allergan common stock, at the election of the holder. Elections of Inamed stockholders are subject to proration as described in Allergan's Form S-4 initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 21, 2005, and subsequently amended, so that 45% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered will be exchanged for cash and 55% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered will be exchanged for shares of Allergan common stock.
Allergan also announced that it has received a request for additional information, referred to as a second request, from the Federal Trade Commission, pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, in connection with the transaction. The second request extends the initial 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act that expired yesterday. Allergan has been working with the Federal Trade Commission staff concerning the divestiture of Reloxin and had anticipated the issuance of the second request as part of that process. Allergan does not expect the second request to result in a material delay in consummation of the transaction.

Relevant risks and uncertainties include those referenced in Allergan's filings with the SEC (which can be obtained as described in "Additional Information" below), and include: general industry and pharmaceutical market conditions; general domestic and international economic conditions; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; challenges inherent in product marketing such as the unpredictability of market acceptance for new pharmaceutical and biologic products and/or the acceptance of new indications for such products; uncertainties regarding analysts and other's projections and estimates for revenues and earnings of Inamed and market growth rates; domestic and foreign health care reforms; the timing and uncertainty of research and development and regulatory processes; trends toward managed care and health care cost containment; and governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations. Risks and uncertainties relating to the proposed business combination transaction include: that required regulatory approvals will not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all; that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction will not be realized; that the integration of Inamed's operations with Allergan will be materially delayed or will be more costly or difficult than expected; and that the proposed transaction will not be consummated. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements, and therefore should be carefully considered.
