Exhibit 99.2
     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2006 combines the historical consolidated statements of earnings of Allergan, Inc. ("Allergan" or the "Company") and Inamed Corporation ("Inamed"), giving effect to Allergan's acquisition of Inamed as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2006.
     On March 23, 2006, Allergan completed the acquisition of Inamed, a global healthcare company that develops, manufactures, and markets a diverse line of products, including breast implants, a range of dermal products to correct facial wrinkles and products for the treatment of obesity. The acquisition has been treated as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, and as such, the Inamed assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their respective fair values. The purchase price for the acquisition, including transaction costs, has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition (March 23, 2006). The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The Company expects that all such goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
     The allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The purchase price for Inamed was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date (March 23, 2006). The Company engaged an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the estimated fair values of in-process research and development, identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets. Such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows, and developing appropriate discount rates. The Company believes the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, respectively, are based on reasonable assumptions. The fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change if additional information becomes available.
     Certain reclassifications have been made to conform Inamed's historical amounts to Allergan's presentation.
     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of earnings is provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of earnings is not necessarily and should not be assumed to be an indication of the results that would have been achieved had the transaction been completed as of the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the future. Furthermore, no effect has been given for synergistic benefits that may be realized through the combination of the two companies or the costs that may be incurred in integrating their operations. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of earnings should be read in conjunction with the respective historical financial statements and the notes thereto that Allergan and Inamed have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Note 1 Basis of Presentation
     On March 23, 2006, Allergan completed the acquisition of Inamed. The acquisition was completed pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of December 20, 2005 and subsequently amended as of March 11, 2006, by and among Allergan, its wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary Banner Acquisition, Inc. ("Banner"), and Inamed (the "Merger Agreement"). The acquisition was accomplished through an exchange offer made by Banner to exchange all outstanding Inamed shares for either $84.00 in cash per Inamed share or 0.8498 of a share of Allergan common stock per Inamed share, subject to proration so that 45% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered were exchanged for cash and 55% of the aggregate Inamed shares tendered were exchanged for shares of Allergan common stock. In the exchange offer, Allergan paid approximately $1.31 billion in cash and issued 16,194,051 shares of common stock for Banner to acquire approximately 93.86 percent of Inamed's outstanding common stock. Following the exchange offer, the remaining outstanding shares of Inamed common stock were acquired for approximately $81.7 million in cash and 1,010,576 shares of Allergan common stock through the merger of Banner with and into Inamed in a merger in which Inamed survived as Allergan's wholly-owned subsidiary. As a final step in the plan of reorganization, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Allergan is planning to merge Inamed into Inamed, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan, with Inamed, LLC surviving the merger.
     The consideration paid in the Inamed acquisition does not include shares of Allergan common stock and cash that were paid to former Inamed option holders for outstanding options to purchase shares of Inamed common stock, which were cancelled in the Inamed acquisition and converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to 45% of the "in the money" value of the option and a number of shares of Allergan common stock with a value equal to 55% of the "in the money" value of the option. Subsequent to the Inamed acquisition, Allergan issued 237,066 shares of common stock and paid $17.9 million in cash to satisfy its obligations to the Inamed option holders. The fair value of these shares of Allergan common stock and cash paid to option holders of Inamed common stock were included in the calculation of the purchase price.
     The allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The purchase price for the Inamed acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their preliminary estimated fair values at the acquisition date (March 23, 2006). Allergan engaged an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the estimated fair values of in-process research and development, identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets. Such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows, and developing appropriate discount rates. Allergan believes the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, respectively, are based on reasonable assumptions. The fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change if additional information becomes available.
      The Inamed acquisition has been treated as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes, and as such, the Inamed assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at fair value. The purchase price for the Inamed acquisition, including transaction costs, has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Allergan expects that all such goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
     The amount allocated to acquired in-process research and development represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology for research projects that, as of the date of the closing of the Inamed acquisition (March 23, 2006), had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The values of the research projects were determined based on analyses using cash flows to be generated by the products that result from the in-process projects. These cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products and then deducting appropriate operating expenses, cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to
 
establish a forecast of net cash flows arising from the in-process technology. These cash flows were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties given the projected stage of development of these projects at closing. A preliminary estimate of $562.8 million was allocated to in-process research and development at the time of closing, which includes the estimated value of Inamed's silicone gel filled breast implant technology for use in the United States ($490.2 million), Juvederm, a non-animal based, cross-linked hyaluranic-acid dermal filler technology for use in the United States ($26.4 million) and Inamed's BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon (BIB) technology for use primarily in the United States ($46.2 million). The amounts allocated to in-process research and development are reflected in Allergan's historical statement of earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2006, which is the period the acquisition was consummated.
     Allergan funded part of the cash portion of the purchase price by borrowing $825 million under a bridge credit facility. In April 2006 Allergan issued $800 million in 5.75% Senior Notes due 2016 and used the proceeds from this issuance to repay the borrowings under the bridge credit facility. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of earnings, the Senior Notes were assumed to have been issued on the date the Inamed acquisition was completed and no borrowings were assumed under the bridge credit facility.
     In connection with the acquisition, Inamed divested its exclusive U.S. sales rights to Reloxin, a botulinum toxin Type A product that has not yet been approved for sale in the United States. The gain on the sale of Reloxin is reflected in Inamed's historical statement of earnings as a reduction of merger expense.
