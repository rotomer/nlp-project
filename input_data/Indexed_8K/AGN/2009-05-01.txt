On January 1, 2009, Allergan adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position APB 14-1, (FSP APB 14-1), which requires retrospective application to prior periods. The impact from the adoption of this accounting rule on the previously reported GAAP results for the first quarter of 2008 was a reduction of diluted earnings per share attributable to stockholders of $0.01 from the amount previously reported. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to stockholders for the first quarter of 2008 were not impacted.
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
Historical non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and guidance amounts for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses, and effective tax rate on non-GAAP earnings as well as net sales reported in constant currency are presented as non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the financial tables of this press release. The reconciliation for the guidance amounts in the financial tables includes historical non-GAAP adjustments and an estimate of the future effect from amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-cash interest expense associated with amortization of convertible debt discount.

All prior period information in the financial tables of this press release has been retrospectively revised due to the adoptions of FSP APB 14-1 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, , .

Forward-Looking Statements
In this press release, the statements regarding product development, market potential, expected growth, anticipated product filings and approvals, the statements by Mr. Pyott as well as the outlook for the state of the economy, Allergan's earnings per share, product net sales, revenue forecasts, future investment allocations, restructuring benefits or outcomes and any other future performance, among other statements above, are forward-looking statements. Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, Allergan's performance at times differs materially from its estimates and targets, and Allergan often does not know what the actual results will be until after a quarter's end and year's end. Therefore, Allergan will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter except through public announcement. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to Allergan.
Any other statements in this press release that refer to Allergan's expected, estimated or anticipated future results are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements in this press release reflect Allergan's current analysis of existing trends and information and represent Allergan's judgment only as of the date of this press release. Actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on a number of factors affecting Allergan's businesses, including, among other things, changing competitive, market and regulatory conditions; the timing and uncertainty of the results of both the research and development and regulatory processes; domestic and foreign health care and cost containment reforms, including government pricing and reimbursement policies; technological advances and patents obtained by competitors; the performance, including the approval, introduction, and consumer and physician acceptance of new products and the continuing acceptance of currently marketed products; the effectiveness of advertising and other promotional campaigns; the timely and successful implementation of strategic initiatives; the results of any pending or future litigation, investigations or claims; the uncertainty associated with the identification of and successful consummation and execution of external corporate development initiatives and strategic partnering transactions; and Allergan's ability to obtain and successfully maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand in a timely manner. In addition, U.S. and international economic conditions, including higher unemployment, financial hardship, consumer confidence and debt levels, taxation, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, international relations, capital and credit availability, the status of financial markets and institutions, as well as the general impact of the current economic crisis, can materially affect Allergan's results. Therefore, the reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Allergan expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required to do so by law.

"GAAP" refers to financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, with respect to the three months ended March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2008 and with respect to anticipated results for the second quarter and full year of 2009. Allergan believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to investors regarding its operational performance because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of Allergan's core business activities by providing a basis for the comparison of results of core business operations between current, past and future periods. The presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In this press release, Allergan reported the non-GAAP financial measures "non-GAAP earnings" and "non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share" as well as "non-GAAP cost of sales," "non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses," "non-GAAP research and development expenses" and "non-GAAP provision for income taxes." Allergan uses non-GAAP earnings to enhance the investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of Allergan's core business activities. Non-GAAP earnings is one of the primary indicators management uses for planning and forecasting in future periods, including trending and analyzing the core operating performance of Allergan's business from period to period without the effect of the non-core business items indicated. Management uses non-GAAP earnings to prepare operating budgets and forecasts and to measure Allergan's performance against those budgets and forecasts on a corporate and segment level. Allergan also uses non-GAAP earnings for evaluating management performance for compensation purposes.
Despite the importance of non-GAAP earnings in analyzing Allergan's underlying business, the budgeting and forecasting process and designing incentive compensation, non-GAAP earnings has no standardized meaning defined by GAAP. Therefore, non-GAAP earnings has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of Allergan's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
 
Allergan compensates for these limitations by using non-GAAP earnings only to supplement net earnings on a basis prepared in conformance with GAAP in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting its business. Allergan strongly encourages investors to consider both net earnings and cash flows determined under GAAP as compared to non-GAAP earnings, and to perform their own analysis, as appropriate.
Allergan also uses the financial measures non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP provision for income taxes, which are sub-components of non-GAAP earnings and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share, for its full year 2009 guidance to provide a more complete understanding of the cost components affecting its business. Allergan includes these financial measures in the determination of non-GAAP earnings to evaluate its management's performance for compensation purposes and to assist in comparing certain of its costs to its competitors' costs. These non-GAAP cost measures do not take into account the non-core business items removed in its calculations of non-GAAP earnings and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share and, therefore, are subject to the same limitations discussed above. Allergan strongly encourages investors to consider both cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses determined under GAAP as compared to the non-GAAP amounts included in this press release.

In this press release, Allergan also reported sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency sales. Constant currency sales represent current period reported sales adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year. Allergan calculates the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported amounts, calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year, to the actual current period reported amounts. Management refers to growth rates at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of Allergan's sales. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower, respectively, than growth reported at actual exchange rates.
Reporting sales performance using constant currency sales has the limitation of excluding currency effects from the comparison of sales results over various periods, even though the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on Allergan's operating results. Investors should consider these effects in their overall analysis of Allergan's operating results.
