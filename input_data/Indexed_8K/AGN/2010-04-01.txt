In the case of amounts to be determined by Third Parties (for example, Net Sales by Sublicensees), such amounts shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect in the country in which such Third Party is engaged. The Parties also recognize that such procedures may change from time to time and that any such changes may affect the definition of Net Sales. The Parties agree that, where such changes are economically material to the Payee, adjustments shall be made to compensate such Payee in order to preserve the same economics as are reflected under this Agreement under the Payor's accounting procedures in effect prior to such change. Where the change is or would be material to such Party, the Payor shall provide an explanation of the proposed change and an accounting of the effect of the change on the relevant revenue, cost, or expense category.

Such Payor shall provide such Payee with notification of any anticipated withholding requirements with as much advance notice as practicable and shall cooperate in good faith with such Payee to legally minimize such withholding taxes. Such Payor will timely pay to the proper governmental authority the amount of any taxes withheld and will provide such Payee with an official tax certificate or other evidence of tax obligation, together with proof of payment from the relevant governmental authority sufficient to enable such Payee to claim such payment of taxes.

If the Payee desires to audit such records, it shall engage an independent, certified public accountant reasonably acceptable to the Payor, to examine such records under conditions of confidentiality with respect thereto at least as stringent as those specified for in Article 12. Such accountant shall be instructed to provide to the Payee a report verifying any report made or payment submitted by the Payor during such period, but shall not disclose to the Payee any confidential Information of the Payor not necessary therefor.

IRVINE, Calif. & Milford, Pa., April 1, 2010, Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN) and Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC today announced a global agreement for the development and commercialization of Ser-120, a Phase III investigational drug currently in clinical development for the treatment of nocturia, a common yet often under-diagnosed urological disorder in adults characterized by frequent urination at night time.
Under the terms of the agreement, Allergan receives exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Ser-120. The agreement encompasses all potential indications except Primary Nocturnal Enuresis (pediatric bedwetting). Allergan will make an upfront payment to Serenity of $43 million, potential development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $122 million, future potential sales milestones, and royalty payments on worldwide sales.
"There is a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of nocturia, which often affects patients who suffer from urologic conditions such as overactive bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia and general primary nocturia. With Allergan's strategic focus on establishing a strong urology franchise and its proven track record in pharmaceutical development and commercialization, we are convinced that this will be a successful partnership," said Samuel Herschkowitz, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Serenity Pharmaceuticals.
"We are pleased to be partnering with Serenity to further explore the potential of Ser-120 as a possible treatment for nocturia, a condition that can negatively impact a patient's quality of life. If successful, Ser-120 would complement our emerging urology portfolio of treatments for a variety of urinary disorders," said Scott Whitcup, M.D., Allergan's Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer.

Ser-120 is a novel, nasally administered clinical drug candidate in Phase III clinical trials being investigated for its safety and efficacy in relieving the symptoms of nocturia and mitigating excessive urinary frequency at night.
