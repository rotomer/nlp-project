A copy of the agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of the civil settlement described in the Settlement Press Release (the "Federal Settlement Agreement") is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated by reference herein. The Company, together with its subsidiary Allergan USA, Inc. ("Allergan USA"), entered into the Federal Settlement Agreement on August 31, 2010 with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia (the "USAO") and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ("OIG-HHS"), the TRICARE Management Activity, the United States Office of Personnel Management, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and Office of Workers' Compensation Programs of the United States Department of Labor; and the relators in the actions identified in the Federal Settlement Agreement.

A copy of the Corporate Integrity Agreement described in the Settlement Press Release (the "Corporate Integrity Agreement") is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this report and incorporated by reference herein. The Company entered into the Corporate Integrity Agreement with OIG-HHS on August 30, 2010. Failure to comply with its obligations under the Corporate Integrity Agreement could result in the Company incurring financial penalties or being excluded from participation in federal health care programs.
The proposed terms and conditions of the Company's plea to the misdemeanor "misbranding" charge referenced in the Settlement Press Release are set forth in a written agreement with the USAO (the "Plea Agreement") that the Company expects will be executed contemporaneously with the plea hearing in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the "Court"). The plea hearing has not yet been scheduled. The recommended sentence in the Plea Agreement is subject to approval by the Court, and there can be no assurance that the Court will approve the Plea Agreement or regarding the timing of any such approval. The form of the Plea Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
The Federal Settlement Agreement provides for payment by the Company of a settlement amount of $225 million, plus accrued interest, consisting of (1) a federal settlement amount of $210.15 million, plus applicable accrued interest, payable to the United States within seven business days after the later of (a) execution of the Federal Settlement Agreement and (b) approval by the Court of the Plea Agreement and (2) a state settlement amount of $14.85 million, plus applicable accrued interest, a designated portion of which state settlement amount and accrued interest would be payable to each U.S. stateincluding as a state, for this purpose, the District of Columbiathat enters into a separate state settlement agreement with the
Company and Allergan USA. If the Court does not accept the Company's guilty plea under, or impose the sentence contemplated by, the Plea Agreement, each of the Company or the United States may, at its option, elect to have the Federal Settlement Agreement become null and void and be rescinded.
The Plea Agreement provides for a sentence, to be imposed by the Court, requiring the Company to pay to the United States $375 million, consisting of a $350 million criminal fine and $25 million in satisfaction of a forfeiture obligation, within 10 business days of the date of sentencing.
Both the Federal Settlement Agreement and the Plea Agreement are conditioned on the Company's dismissal with prejudice of the declaratory judgment action filed by the Company in October 2009 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, captioned Allergan, Inc. v. United States, et al., 1:09-cv-01879, in which the Company sought a ruling that it could proactively share truthful scientific and medical information with the medical community to assist physicians in evaluating the risks and benefits if they choose to use off-label to treat certain forms of spasticity.

The description of the Federal Settlement Agreement, the Corporate Integrity Agreement and the Plea Agreement in this Item 1.01 is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Federal Settlement Agreement, the Corporate Integrity Agreement and the form of Plea Agreement, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, hereto and incorporated herein by reference. If the Court does not approve the Plea Agreement, there can be no assurance that the Federal Settlement Agreement will take effect as currently contemplated or at all or that any charges or claims to which the Plea Agreement, the Federal Settlement Agreement or the government investigation relates would ultimately be resolved in a manner consistent with, or not materially more adverse to the Company than, the terms and conditions that would apply under the Plea Agreement, the Federal Settlement Agreement and related state settlement agreements and the Corporate Integrity Agreement as described in this report.
Item 2.06.    Material Impairments.
On August 31, 2010, the Company concluded that the intangible assets and a related prepaid royalty asset associated with the franchise (the " Assets"), which the Company acquired in connection with its October 2007 acquisition of Esprit Pharma Holding Company, Inc. and certain subsequent licensing and commercialization transactions, have become impaired. The Company determined that an impairment charge was required with respect to the Assets because the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over their remaining useful life were not sufficient to recover the current carrying amount of the Assets and the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of those assets due to a recent reduction in expected future financial performance for the franchise resulting from lower than anticipated acceptance by patients, physicians and payers. As a result, the Company's third quarter and full year 2010 financial results are expected to include an aggregate non-cash pretax impairment charge of approximately $340 million to $350 million related to the Assets. The Company has not yet completed its analysis of the fair value of the Assets and expects to complete that analysis by the end of its third fiscal quarter. The

amount of the impairment charge is dependent upon a final determination of the fair value of the Assets. This non-cash impairment charge will have no effect on the Company's cash balances, cash flows from operating activities or ongoing operations, and the Company will continue to market and sell the product line.

G.         The United States contends that it and the Medicaid Participating States have certain civil claims, as specified in Paragraph 2, below, against Allergan for engaging in the following conduct during the period January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the "Covered Conduct"):
 
 
 
 
As a result of the foregoing conduct, the Government alleges that Allergan caused false or fraudulent claims for Botox to be submitted to, or caused purchases by, Medicare, Medicaid and the Other Federal Health Care Programs.
With respect only to claims for Botox submitted to Medicaid, Medicare and the Other Federal Health Care Programs with diagnosis codes for overactive bladder and neurogenic bladder conditions (ICD-9-CM 788.30, 788.31, 788.32, 788.33, 788.34, and 599.82), the Covered Conduct extends from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2009.
Notwithstanding Preamble Paragraph G(iii), the Covered Conduct does not include conduct relating to claims for Botox submitted to Medicaid, Medicare and the Other Federal Health Care Programs with the diagnosis codes ICD-9-CM 333.81 (blepharospasm) and ICD-9- CM 705.21, 705.22, and 780.8 (hyperhidrosis).
H.         The United States also contends that it has certain administrative claims against Allergan, as set forth in Paragraphs 4 through 7, below, for engaging in the Covered Conduct.
I.         This Agreement is made in compromise of disputed claims. This Agreement is not an admission of facts or liability by Allergan. With the exception of such admissions that are made in connection with any guilty plea by Allergan in connection with the Criminal Action, Allergan expressly denies the allegations of the United States and the Relators as set forth herein
 
and in the Civil Actions and denies that it engaged in any wrongful conduct in connection with the Covered Conduct. This Agreement is not a concession by the United States that its claims are not well founded. Neither this Agreement, its execution, nor the performance of any obligation under it, including any payment, nor the fact of any settlement, is intended to be, or shall be understood as, an admission of liability or wrongdoing, or other expression reflecting on the merits of the dispute by Allergan.
J.        To avoid the delay, uncertainty, inconvenience, and expense of protracted litigation of the above claims, the Parties reach a full and final settlement pursuant to the Terms and Conditions below.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in reliance on the representations contained herein and in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, and obligations in this Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:
1.        Allergan agrees to pay to the United States and the Medicaid Participating States, collectively, the sum of Two Hundred and Twenty Five Million Dollars ($225,000,000), plus accrued interest at the rate of 3.5% per annum from January 25, 2010, and continuing until and including the day of payment (the "Settlement Amount"). The Settlement Amount shall constitute a debt immediately due and owing to the United States and the Medicaid Participating States on the Effective Date of this Agreement. This debt shall be discharged by payments to the United States and the Medicaid Participating States, under the following terms and conditions:
(a)        Allergan shall pay to the United States the sum of $210,150,000 plus accrued interest as set forth above ("Federal Settlement Amount"). The Federal Settlement Amount shall be paid by electronic funds transfer pursuant to written instructions from the United States no later than seven (7) business days after (i) this Agreement is fully executed by the Parties and delivered to Allergan's attorneys; or (ii) the Court accepts a Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) guilty plea as described in Preamble Paragraph C in connection with the Criminal Action and imposes the agreed upon sentence, whichever occurs later.
(b)        Allergan shall deposit the sum of $14,850,000, plus accrued interest as set forth above ("Medicaid State Settlement Amount") into one or more interest-bearing money market or bank accounts (the "State Settlement Accounts") that are held in the name of Allergan but segregated from other Allergan accounts, and shall pay the Medicaid Participating States
 
from the State Settlement Accounts pursuant to written instructions from the NAMFCU Negotiating Team and under the terms and conditions of the Medicaid State Settlement Agreements that Allergan will enter into with the Medicaid Participating States.
(c)        Contingent upon the United States receiving the Federal Settlement Amount from Allergan, the United States agrees to pay, as soon as feasible upon receipt, Amy M. Lang and Charles J. Rushin $37,827,000, plus a proportionate share of the actual accrued interest paid to the United States by Allergan, as set forth in Paragraph 1.a., above, ("Relators' Share") as Relators' share of the proceeds pursuant to 31 U.S.C.  3730(d). No other relator payments shall be made by the United States with respect to the matters covered by this Agreement. All Relators represent that they will abide by the terms of any written and executed separate agreements that they may have entered into with one or more of the other Relators concerning the allocation of the Relators' Share among themselves.
(d)        If Allergan's agreed-upon guilty plea pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) in the Criminal Action described in Preamble Paragraph C is not accepted by the Court or the Court does not impose the agreed-upon sentence for whatever reason, this Agreement shall be null and void at the option of either the United States or Allergan. If either the United States or Allergan exercises this option, which option shall be exercised by notifying all Parties, through counsel, in writing within five (5) business days of the Court's decision, the Parties will not object and this Agreement will be rescinded. If this Agreement is rescinded, Allergan will not plead, argue or otherwise raise any defenses under the theories of statute of limitations, laches, estoppel or similar theories, to any civil or administrative claims, actions or proceedings arising from the Covered Conduct that are brought by the United States within 90
 
calendar days of rescission, except to the extent such defenses were available on the day on which the complaints listed in Preamble Paragraph B, above, were filed.
qui
tam
(e)        If the stay of the D.C. Litigation described in Preamble Paragraph D is lifted before Allergan dismisses with prejudice the D.C. Litigation pursuant to Paragraph 19, below, this Agreement shall be null and void at the option of either the United States or Allergan. If either the United States or Allergan exercises this option, which option shall be exercised by notifying all Parties, through counsel, in writing within five (5) business days of the Court's decision to lift the stay, the Parties will not object and this Agreement will be rescinded. If this Agreement is rescinded, Allergan will not plead, argue or otherwise raise any defenses under the theories of statute of limitations, laches, estoppel or similar theories, to any civil or administrative claims, actions or proceedings arising from the Covered Conduct that are brought by the United States within 90 calendar days of rescission, except to the extent such defenses were available on the day on which the complaints listed in Preamble Paragraph B, above, were filed.

Releasees, arising in any way out of or connected in any way with the facts, claims, and circumstances alleged in, arising under, or arising from the filing of the Civil Actions, or from any other past activities and actions of the Allergan Releasees, except for: (1) claims for attorneys' fees, expenses and costs pursuant to 31 U.S.C.  3730(d); (2) claims for a Relators' Share under the Medicaid State Settlement Agreements; and (3) any employment discrimination claims that Albert Edward Hallivis may have against Allergan; and
(b)        agree not to disseminate any documents or communications in their possession or control, or information from such documents or communications, that can be readily identified as having been created in whole or in part by, or at the direction of, Allergan. In this regard, Relators and their counsel will make a good faith effort to identify all such materials. The obligations in this subparagraph do not apply: (1) to documents or information in the public record or domain; (2) to the extent that compliance with the obligation would conflict with a statute or regulation; (3) if disclosure is required by a subpoena or court order; or (4) in the case of employee Albert Edward Hallivis, to the degree he is authorized by Allergan to utilize business records as necessary within the scope of his current employment.
11.    Allergan waives and shall not assert any defenses Allergan may have to any criminal prosecution or administrative action relating to the Covered Conduct that may be based in whole or in part on a contention that, under the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, or under the Excessive Fines Clause in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, this Agreement bars a remedy sought in such criminal prosecution or administrative action. Nothing in this paragraph or any other provision of this Agreement constitutes an agreement by the United States concerning the characterization of the Settlement Amount for purposes of the Internal Revenue laws, Title 26 of the United States Code.
 
12.    Allergan fully and finally releases the United States, its agencies, employees, servants, and agents from any claims (including attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses of every kind and however denominated) that Allergan has asserted, could have asserted, or may assert in the future against the United States, its agencies, employees, servants, and agents, related to the Covered Conduct or arising from the United States' investigation and prosecution of the Civil Actions and the Criminal Action.
13.    Conditioned upon Relators' compliance with their obligations under this Agreement, Allergan, for itself, its predecessors, and its current and former divisions, parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and assigns, and their current and former officers, directors, trustees, agents, servants, employees, representatives, attorneys, consultants, executors, and administrators, when acting on behalf of Allergan or any of its affiliated companies, fully and finally releases and forever discharges Relators and their heirs, successors, attorneys, agents, and assigns (collectively, "Relator Releasees") from any and all claims for relief, actions, rights, causes of action, suits, debts, obligations, liabilities, demands, losses, damages (including treble damages and any civil penalties), punitive damages, costs, and expenses of any kind, character, or nature whatsoever, known or unknown, fixed or contingent, in law or in equity, in contract or in tort, or under any federal or state statute or regulation or otherwise that Allergan, its predecessors, or its current and former divisions, parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or assigns may now have or claim to have against the Relator Releasees, arising in any way out of or connected in any way with the facts, claims, and circumstances alleged in, arising under, or arising from the Civil Actions, or from any other past activities and actions of the Relator Releasees, except to the extent related to: (1) claims Relators may have under 31 U.S.C.  3730(d); (2) claims for a Relators' Share under the Medicaid State Settlement Agreements; or (3)
 
any employment discrimination claim that Albert Edward Hallivis may have against Allergan, or rights Allergan may have arising out of any violation by him of the terms and conditions of his employment. Allergan attests that, upon inquiry of its Legal Department, it is not presently aware of any claims its officers, directors, employees, or agents may have against Relator Releasees.
14.    The Settlement Amount shall not be decreased as a result of the denial of claims for payment now being withheld from payment by any Medicare carrier or intermediary or any other state or Federal payer, related to the Covered Conduct; and Allergan agrees not to resubmit to any Medicare carrier or intermediary or any other state or Federal payer any previously denied claims related to the Covered Conduct, and agrees not to appeal any such denials of claims.
15.    Allergan agrees to the following:
(a)     that all costs (as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R.  31.205-47; and in Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.  1395-1395hhh and 1396-1396v; and the regulations and official program directives promulgated thereunder) incurred by or on behalf of Allergan, its present or former officers, directors, employees, shareholders, and agents in connection with the following shall be "Unallowable Costs" on government contracts and under the Medicare Program, Medicaid Program, TRICARE Program, and FEHBP:
Unallowable Costs Defined:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, nothing in this Paragraph 15.a.vi. that may apply to the obligations undertaken pursuant to the CIA affects the status of costs that are not allowable based on any other authority applicable to Allergan. (All costs described or set forth in this Paragraph 15.a. are hereafter "Unallowable Costs.")
(b)        : These Unallowable Costs shall be separately determined and accounted for by Allergan, and Allergan shall not charge such Unallowable Costs directly or indirectly to any contracts with the United States or any State Medicaid program, or seek payment for such Unallowable Costs through any cost report, cost statement, information statement, or payment request submitted by Allergan or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to the Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, or FEHBP Programs.
Future Treatment of Unallowable Costs
(c)        : Allergan
Treatment of Unallowable Costs Previously Submitted for Payment
 
further agrees that within 90 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement it shall identify to applicable Medicare and TRICARE fiscal intermediaries, carriers, and/or contractors, and Medicaid and FEHBP fiscal agents, any Unallowable Costs (as defined in this Paragraph) included in payments previously sought from the United States, or any State Medicaid program, including, but not limited to, payments sought in any cost reports, cost statements, information reports, or payment requests already submitted by Allergan or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, and shall request, and agree, that such cost reports, cost statements, information reports, or payment requests, even if already settled, be adjusted to account for the effect of the inclusion of the unallowable costs. Allergan agrees that the United States, at a minimum, shall be entitled to recoup from Allergan any overpayment plus applicable interest and penalties as a result of the inclusion of such Unallowable Costs on previously-submitted cost reports, information reports, cost statements, or requests for payment.
Any payments due after the adjustments have been made shall be paid to the United States pursuant to the direction of the Department of Justice and/or the affected agencies. The United States reserves its rights to disagree with any calculations submitted by Allergan or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates on the effect of inclusion of Unallowable Costs (as defined in this Paragraph) on Allergan or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates' cost reports, cost statements, or information reports.
(d)        Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of the rights of the United States to audit, examine, or re-examine Allergan's books and records to determine that no Unallowable Costs have been claimed in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph.
16.        This Agreement is intended to be for the benefit of the Parties only. The Parties do not release any claims against any other person or entity, except as explicitly stated in this
 
Agreement, including in Paragraph 17 (waiver for beneficiaries paragraph), below.
17.        Allergan agrees that it waives and shall not seek payment for any of the health care billings covered by this Agreement from any health care beneficiaries or their parents, sponsors, legally responsible individuals, or third party payors based upon the claims defined as Covered Conduct.
18.        Allergan warrants that it has reviewed its financial situation and that it currently is solvent within the meaning of 11 U.S.C.  547(b)(3) and 548(a)(1)(B)(ii)(I), and shall remain solvent following payment to the United States of the Settlement Amount. Further, the Parties warrant that, in evaluating whether to execute this Agreement, they (a) have intended that the mutual promises, covenants, and obligations set forth herein constitute a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to Allergan, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C.  547(c)(1); and (b) conclude that these mutual promises, covenants, and obligations do, in fact, constitute such a contemporaneous exchange. Further, the Parties warrant that the mutual promises, covenants, and obligations set forth herein are intended to and do, in fact, represent a reasonably equivalent exchange of value that is not intended to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which Allergan was or became indebted to on or after the date of this transfer, within the meaning of 11 U.S.C.  548(a)(1).
19.        Within seven (7) days of making the payments described in Paragraph 1, above, Allergan shall file a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice in the D.C. Litigation.
20.        Upon the Effective Date of this Agreement, the United States shall file in Civil Action III a Notice of Intervention as to the Covered Conduct. Upon receipt of the payments described in Paragraph 1, above, and entry of an order dismissing the D.C. Litigation with prejudice, the United States and Relators shall file a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal in each of the
 
Civil Actions as follows:
(a)        each stipulation of dismissal shall be with prejudice as to the United States' and Relators' claims as to Allergan as to the Covered Conduct in each Civil Action pursuant to and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
(b)        each stipulation of dismissal shall be without prejudice to the United States and with prejudice as to Relators as to all other claims; and
(c)        provided, however, that the following claims against Allergan shall not be dismissed until they are settled, adjudicated, or otherwise resolved, and the Court is so informed: (a) Relators' claims for reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs pursuant to 31 U.S.C.  3730(d); (b) Relators' claims for a Relators' Share under the Medicaid State Settlement Agreements; and (c) any employment discrimination claims that Albert Edward Hallivis may have against Allergan.
21.        Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs incurred in connection with this matter, including the preparation and performance of this Agreement.

resolution provisions in the CIA.
25.        For purposes of construction, this Agreement shall be deemed to have been drafted by all Parties to this Agreement and shall not, therefore, be construed against any Party for that reason in any subsequent dispute.
26.        This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the Parties. This Agreement may not be amended except by written consent of the Parties.
27.        The individuals signing this Agreement on behalf of Allergan represent and warrant that they are authorized by Allergan to execute this Agreement.

Review Procedures
1.
General Description.
a. . Within 120 days after the Effective Date, Allergan shall engage an entity (or entities), such as an accounting, auditing, or consulting firm (hereinafter "Independent Review Organization" or "IRO"), to perform reviews required by this CIA to assist Allergan in assessing and evaluating its Promotional Functions and its Product Related Functions. The applicable requirements relating to the IRO are outlined in Appendix A to this CIA, which is incorporated by reference.
Engagement of Independent Review Organization
Each IRO engaged by Allergan shall have expertise in applicable Federal health care program and FDA requirements as may be appropriate to the Review for which the IRO is retained. Each IRO shall assess, along with Allergan, whether it can perform the engagement in a professionally independent and objective fashion, as appropriate to the nature of the review, taking into account any other business relationships or other engagements that may exist.
The IRO(s) shall conduct two types of reviews that assess Allergan's systems, processes, policies, procedures, and practices relating to Promotional Functions and to Product Related Functions (collectively, "IRO Reviews").
b. As set forth more fully in Appendix B, the IRO Reviews shall consist of two components: a Systems Review and a Transactions Review. The Systems Review shall assess Allergan's systems, processes, policies,
Frequency and Brief Description of Reviews.
 
and procedures relating to Promotional Functions and Product Related Functions. If there are no material changes in Allergan's relevant systems, processes, policies, and procedures, the IRO Systems Review shall be performed for the periods covering the first and fourth Reporting Periods. If Allergan materially changes its relevant systems, processes, policies, and procedures, the IRO shall perform a Systems Review for the Reporting Period in which such changes were made in addition to conducting the Systems Review for the first and fourth Reporting Periods, as set forth more fully in Appendix B.
The Promotional and Product Services Transactions Review shall be performed annually and shall cover each of the five Reporting Periods. The IRO(s) shall perform all components of each annual Transaction Review. As set forth more fully in Appendix B, the Transactions Review shall include several components.
In addition, each Transactions Review shall also include a review of up to three additional areas or practices of Allergan identified by the OIG in its discretion (hereafter "Additional Items"). For purposes of identifying the Additional Items to be included in the Transactions Review for a particular Reporting Period, the OIG will consult with Allergan and may consider internal audit work conducted by Allergan, Allergan's Government Reimbursed Product portfolio, the nature and scope of Allergan's promotional practices and arrangements with HCPs and HCIs, and other information known to it.
As set forth more fully in Appendix B, Allergan may propose to the OIG that its internal audit(s) be partially substituted for one or more of the Additional Items that would otherwise be reviewed by the IRO as part of the Transactions Review. The OIG retains sole discretion over whether, and in what manner, to allow Allergan's internal audit work to be substituted for a portion of the Additional Items review conducted by the IRO.
 
The OIG shall notify Allergan of the nature and scope of the IRO review for each of the Additional Items not later than 150 days prior to the end of each Reporting Period. Prior to undertaking the review of the Additional Items, the IRO and/or Allergan shall submit an audit work plan to the OIG for approval and the IRO shall conduct the review of the Additional Items based on a work plan approved by the OIG.
c. . The IRO and Allergan shall retain and make available to OIG, upon request, all work papers, supporting documentation, correspondence, and draft reports (those exchanged between the IRO and Allergan) related to the reviews.
Retention of Records
2. The IRO(s) shall prepare a report (or reports) based upon each Review performed (IRO Review Report). The information and content to be included in the IRO Review Report is described in Appendix B, which is incorporated by reference.
IRO Review Reports.
3. . In the event OIG has reason to believe that: (a) any IRO Review fails to conform to the requirements of this CIA; or (b) the IRO's findings or Review results are inaccurate, OIG may, at its sole discretion, conduct its own review to determine whether the applicable IRO Review complied with the requirements of the CIA and/or the findings or Review results are inaccurate (Validation Review). Allergan shall pay for the reasonable cost of any such review performed by OIG or any of its designated agents. Any Validation Review of Reports submitted as part of Allergan's final Annual Report shall be initiated no later than one year after Allergan's final submission (as described in Section II) is received by OIG.
Validation Review
Prior to initiating a Validation Review, OIG shall notify Allergan of its intent to do so and provide a written explanation of why OIG believes such a review is necessary. To resolve any concerns raised by OIG, Allergan may request a meeting with OIG to: (a) discuss the results of any Review submissions or findings; (b) present any additional information to clarify the results of the applicable Review or to correct the inaccuracy of the Review; and/or (c) propose alternatives to the proposed Validation Review. Allergan agrees to provide any additional information as may be requested by OIG under this Section III.D.3 in an expedited manner. OIG will attempt in good faith to resolve any Review issues with Allergan prior to conducting a Validation Review.
 
However, the final determination as to whether or not to proceed with a Validation Review shall be made at the sole discretion of OIG.
4. . The IRO shall include in its report(s) to Allergan a certification or sworn affidavit that it has evaluated its professional independence and objectivity, as appropriate to the nature of the engagement, with regard to the applicable Review and that it has concluded that it is, in fact, independent and objective.
Independence and Objectivity Certification
E.      . Allergan currently has a disclosure program that Allergan represents is designed to facilitate communications relating to compliance with Federal health care program and FDA requirements and Allergan's policies (the "Disclosure Program"). During the term of the CIA, Allergan shall maintain a Disclosure Program that includes a mechanism (a toll-free compliance telephone line and/or on-line electronic reporting) to enable individuals to disclose, to the Chief Compliance Officer or some other person who is not in the disclosing individual's chain of command, any identified issues or questions associated with Allergan's policies, conduct, practices, or procedures with respect to a Federal health care program or FDA requirement believed by the individual to be a potential violation of criminal, civil, or administrative law. Allergan shall continue to appropriately publicize the existence of the disclosure mechanism (, via periodic e-mails to employees or by posting the information in prominent common areas).
Disclosure Program
e.g.
The Disclosure Program shall emphasize a nonretaliation policy, and shall include a reporting mechanism for anonymous communications for which appropriate confidentiality shall be maintained. Upon receipt of a disclosure, the Chief Compliance Officer (or designee) shall gather all relevant information from the disclosing individual. The Chief Compliance Officer (or designee) shall make a preliminary, good faith inquiry into the allegations set forth in every disclosure to ensure that he or she has obtained all of the information necessary to determine whether a further review should be conducted. For any disclosure that is sufficiently specific so that it reasonably: 1) permits a determination of the appropriateness of the alleged improper practice; and 2) provides an opportunity for taking corrective action, Allergan shall conduct an internal review of the allegations set forth in the disclosure and ensure that proper follow-up is conducted.
The Chief Compliance Officer (or designee) shall maintain a disclosure log, which shall include a record and summary of each disclosure received (whether anonymous or
 
not), the status of the respective internal reviews, and any corrective action taken in response to the internal reviews. The disclosure log shall be made available to OIG upon request.
F. .

Field Force Monitoring and Review Efforts
To the extent not already accomplished, within 120 days after the Effective Date, Allergan shall establish a comprehensive Field Force Monitoring Program (FFMP) to
 
evaluate and monitor sales representatives' interactions with HCPs and HCIs relating to Government Reimbursed Products. The FFMP shall be a formalized process designed to directly and indirectly observe the appropriateness of sales representatives' interactions with HCPs relating to Government Reimbursed Products and to identify potential off-label promotional activities relating to such products. As described in more detail below, the FFMP shall include: 1) a Speaker Monitoring Program; 2) direct field observations (Observations) of sales representatives; and 3) the monitoring and review of other records relating to sales representatives' interactions with HCPs and HCIs (Records Reviews).
Allergan represents that, prior to the Effective Date, it developed and implemented a comprehensive system for streamlining business and compliance processes. This system is referred to as the Business Execution Automated Compliance Navigator (BEACON). BEACON is used to manage consultant arrangements with HCPs, Advisory Boards, Speaker Programs, and provision of educational items, meals, and expenses. In addition to the data entered by individual users, BEACON interfaces with some of Allergan's other systems, including the system through which promotional materials are reviewed and approved and the system through which expenses are tracked.
Allergan represents that in BEACON, consulting arrangements are managed through annual operating plans (discussed further below), entry of requests for individual events, including completion of a form addressing details and the business need for the event, and review and approval of those requests. BEACON includes controls that identifies when a proposed event or arrangement does not comply with Allergan's policies and procedures and notifies the Corporate Compliance Department of that issue for additional review and approval. BEACON requires that documentation of the event and any expenses incurred be uploaded to the system and verified by the responsible employee. If all requirements are met, BEACON approves payments to HCPs and tracks aggregate payments.
As it applies to certain processes, BEACON is described further below.
1.      With regard to speaker programs relating to Government Reimbursed Products, Allergan shall maintain processes to require all speakers to complete training and enter written agreements that describe the scope of work to be performed, the speaker fees to be paid, and compliance obligations for the speakers (including requirements that the speaker may only use Allergan approved materials and may not directly or indirectly promote the product for off-label uses).
Speaker Program Activities.
 
Allergan shall maintain a centralized electronic system (BEACON) through which all such speaker programs are administered. BEACON shall establish controls regarding eligibility and qualifications of speakers and venues for the programs and require that speakers are paid according to a centrally managed rate structure determined based on a fair-market value analysis conducted by Allergan. Allergan shall continue to maintain a comprehensive list of speaker program attendees through BEACON. In addition, through BEACON, Allergan shall track and review the aggregate amount (including speaker fees, travel, and other expenses) paid to each speaker in connection with speaker programs relating to Government Reimbursed Products conducted during each Reporting Period. Allergan shall require, through BEACON, certified evaluations by sales representatives or other Allergan personnel regarding whether a speaker program complied with Allergan requirements, and in the event of non-compliance, Allergan shall require the identification of the policy violation and ensure appropriate follow up activity to address the violation.
To the extent not already accomplished, Allergan shall institute a Speaker Monitoring Program under which Allergan compliance or management personnel or outside personnel acting on behalf of Allergan shall attend 75 speaker programs relating to Government Reimbursed Products during each Reporting Period and conduct live monitoring of the programs (Speaker Monitoring Program). The programs subject to the Speaker Monitoring Program shall be selected both on a risk-based targeting approach and on a sampling approach. For each program reviewed, personnel conducting the Speaker Monitoring Program shall review slide materials and other materials used as part of the speaker program, speaker statements made during the program, and Allergan representative activities during the program to assess whether the programs were conducted in a manner consistent with Allergan's Policies and Procedures. Allergan shall maintain the controls around speaker programs as described above, and shall conduct its Speaker Monitoring Program as described above throughout the term of the CIA.
2.      . As a component of the FFMP, Allergan compliance personnel shall conduct observations of sales representatives to assess whether the messages delivered and materials distributed to HCPs are consistent with applicable legal requirements and with Allergan's Policies and Procedures. These observations shall be full day ride-alongs with sales representatives (Observations), and each Observation shall consist of directly observing all meetings between a sales representative and HCPs during the workday. The Observations shall be scheduled throughout the year, selected by Allergan compliance personnel both on a risk-based targeting approach and on a sampling
Observations
 
approach, include each therapeutic area and actively promoted product, and be conducted across the United States. At the completion of each Observation, Allergan compliance personnel shall prepare a report which includes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergan U.S. compliance personnel shall conduct at least 30 Observations during each Reporting Period.
3.      . As a component of the FFMP, Allergan shall also review various types of records to assess sales representatives' interactions with HCPs and HCIs and to identify potential or actual compliance violations. For each Reporting Period, Allergan shall develop and implement a plan for conducting Records Reviews associated with at least three Government Reimbursed Products and a sampling of the representatives promoting those products in every separate region. The OIG shall have the discretion to identify the three Government Reimbursed Products to be reviewed for each Reporting Period. The OIG will select the products based on information about Allergan's products provided by Allergan, upon request by the OIG no later than 60 days prior to the beginning of the Reporting Period, and other information known to the OIG. If the OIG does not identify the Government Reimbursed Products to be reviewed within the first 30 days of the Reporting Period, Allergan shall select the three products to be reviewed.
Records Reviews
For the first Reporting Period, the Records Reviews shall include the monitoring and review of: 1) records in BEACON relating to sales representatives' interactions with HCPs and HCIs relating to promotional speaker program activities, meals and expenses, and advisory boards; 2) requests for medical information; 3) sales representatives' call notes; 4) sales representatives' e-mails; and 5) recorded results of the Observations of sales representatives.
 
For the second and subsequent Reporting Periods, the Records Reviews shall include the monitoring and review of: 1) records in BEACON relating to sales representatives' interactions with HCPs and HCIs; 2) requests for medical information; 3) message recall studies or any other similar records in Allergan's possession purporting to reflect the details of sales representatives' interactions with HCPs and HCIs; 4) sales representative call notes; 5) sales representatives' e-mails and any electronic records; and 6) recorded results of the Observations of sales representatives and other notes or information from the sales representatives' managers relating to interactions between the sales representatives and HCPs and HCIs pertaining to the Government Reimbursed Product at issue.
4.        .  Personnel conducting the Speaker Monitoring Program, Observations, and Records Reviews shall have access to all relevant records and information necessary to assess potential or actual compliance violations. Results from the FFMP monitoring, including the identification of potential violations of policies and/or legal requirements, shall be compiled and reported to the Corporate Compliance Department for review and follow-up as appropriate. In the event that a potential violation of Allergan's Policies and Procedures or of legal or compliance requirements, including but not limited to potential off-label promotion, is identified during any aspect of the FFMP, Allergan shall investigate the incident consistent with established Policies and Procedures for the handling of investigations and shall take all necessary and appropriate responsive action (including disciplinary action) and corrective action, including the disclosure of Reportable Events pursuant to Section III.H above, if applicable. Any compliance issues identified during a Speaker Monitoring Program, Observation and/or Records Review and any corrective action shall be recorded in the files of the Corporate Compliance Department.
Reporting and Follow-up
Allergan shall include a summary of the FFMP and the results of the FFMP as part of each Annual Report. As part of each Annual Report, Allergan also shall provide the OIG with copies of the Observation report for any instances in which it was determined that improper promotion occurred and a description of the action(s) that Allergan took as a result of such determinations. Allergan shall make the Observation reports for all other Observations available to the OIG upon request.

To the extent that Allergan engages U.S.-based HCPs for services that relate to Promotional Functions or to Product Related Functions, other than for speaker programs or research-related functions ( as a member of an advisory board or to attend consultant meetings), such HCPs shall be referred to herein as Consultants. Allergan shall require all Consultants to enter written agreements describing the scope of work to be performed, the fees to be paid, and compliance obligations for the Consultants. Allergan shall continue to maintain a centralized electronic system through BEACON where all such Consultant arrangements are administered. BEACON shall establish controls regarding eligibility and qualifications of Consultants and requires that Consultants are paid according to a rate structure based on fair market value. Allergan shall maintain a comprehensive list of Consultants through BEACON. In addition, through BEACON, Allergan shall track and review the aggregate amount paid to each Consultant in connection with Consultant arrangements relating to Government Reimbursed Products conducted during each Reporting Period.
Consultant Arrangement Activities
e.g.,
To the extent not already accomplished, within 150 days after the Effective Date, Allergan shall establish a process to develop annual operating plans that identify the business needs for, and the estimated numbers of, various Consultant engagements and activities to occur during the following year. Such annual operating plans shall include a needs assessment (or business rationale form) to justify the retention of a Consultant prior to the retention of the Consultant. The needs assessment shall identify the business need for the retention of the Consultant and provide specific details about the consulting arrangement (, information about the numbers and qualifications of the HCPs or HCIs to be engaged, the agenda for the proposed meeting and a description of the proposed work to be done and type of work product to be generated). Any deviations from the Consultant operating plans shall be documented in the needs assessment form (or business rationale form) and shall be subject to review and approval by Allergan compliance personnel. The annual operating plans shall also identify the budgeted
e.g.
 
amounts to be spent on Consultant-related activities. Allergan's compliance personnel shall be involved in the review and approval of such operating plans, including any subsequent modification of an approved plan.

The Consultant Program Observations shall include live monitoring of at least 10 advisory board programs and monitoring of 20 other professional services agreements with HCPs. The Consultant Monitoring Program shall review Consultant arrangements both on a risk-based targeting approach and on a sampling approach. Allergan compliance personnel conducting the Consultant Program Observations shall review needs assessment documents, consultant contracts, and materials relating to the program or work of the Consultant (including work product resulting from any program or event), in order to assess whether the programs and arrangements were conducted in a manner consistent with Allergan's Policies and Procedures. Results from the Consultant Program Observations, including the identification of potential violations of policies, shall be compiled and reported to the Corporate Compliance Department for review and follow-up, as appropriate.
2. . To the extent that Allergan or any Allergan Affiliate (hereafter in this Section III.K.2, collectively "Allergan") provides funding or other support to U.S.-based HCPs or HCIs to conduct Phase IV post-marketing studies or IITs, such HCPs and HCIs shall be referred to collectively as "Researchers". Allergan shall require all Researchers to enter written agreements describing the scope of the research or other work to be performed, the fees to be paid, and compliance obligations for the Researchers. Researchers shall be paid based on a fair-market value analysis conducted by Allergan. This fair-market value analysis shall be incorporated into guidelines that are used in the review, approval, and funding of Researchers' activities.
Research-Related Activities
 
Documentation of such review, approval, and funding activities shall be maintained by Allergan Medical Affairs.
To the extent not already accomplished, within 150 days after the Effective Date, Allergan shall establish an annual budgeting plan for Researchers that identifies the business or scientific need for, and the estimated numbers of, the various Researcher engagements and activities to occur during the year.

Within 10 days after the receipt of the Demand Letter, Allergan shall either: (a) cure the breach to OIG's satisfaction and pay the applicable Stipulated Penalties; or (b) request a hearing before an HHS administrative law judge (ALJ) to dispute OIG's determination of noncompliance, pursuant to the agreed upon provisions set forth below in Section X.E. In the event Allergan elects to request an ALJ hearing, the Stipulated Penalties shall continue to accrue until Allergan cures, to OIG's satisfaction, the alleged breach in dispute. Failure to respond to the Demand Letter in one of these two manners within the allowed time period shall be considered a material breach of this CIA and shall be grounds for exclusion under Section X.D.
Response to Demand Letter.
3. . Payment of the Stipulated Penalties shall be made by electronic funds transfer to an account specified by OIG in the Demand Letter.
Form of Payment
4. . Except as set forth in Section X.D.1.c, these provisions for payment of Stipulated Penalties shall not affect or otherwise set a standard for OIG's decision that Allergan has materially breached this CIA, which decision shall be made at OIG's discretion and shall be governed by the provisions in Section X.D, below.
Independence from Material Breach Determination
D. .
Exclusion for Material Breach of this CIA
1. . A material breach of this CIA means:
Definition of Material Breach
 
a. a repeated or flagrant violation of the obligations under this CIA, including, but not limited to, the obligations addressed in Section X.A;
b. a failure to respond to a Demand Letter concerning the payment of Stipulated Penalties in accordance with Section X.C; or
c. a failure of the Board to issue a resolution in accordance with Section III.A.3.
2. . The parties agree that a material breach of this CIA by Allergan constitutes an independent basis for Allergan's exclusion from participation in the Federal health care programs. Upon a determination by OIG that Allergan has materially breached this CIA and that exclusion is the appropriate remedy, OIG shall notify Allergan of: (a) Allergan's material breach; and (b) OIG's intent to exercise its contractual right to impose exclusion (this notification is hereinafter referred to as the "Notice of Material Breach and Intent to Exclude").
Notice of Material Breach and Intent to Exclude
3. . Allergan shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the Notice of Material Breach and Intent to Exclude to demonstrate to OIG's satisfaction that:
Opportunity to Cure
a. Allergan is in compliance with the obligations of the CIA cited by OIG as being the basis for the material breach;
b. the alleged material breach has been cured; or
c. the alleged material breach cannot be cured within the 30-day period, but that: (i) Allergan has begun to take action to cure the material breach; (ii) Allergan is pursuing such action with due diligence; and (iii) Allergan has provided to OIG a reasonable timetable for curing the material breach.
4. . If, at the conclusion of the 30-day period, Allergan fails to satisfy the requirements of Section X.D.3, OIG may exclude Allergan from participation in the Federal health care programs. OIG shall notify Allergan in writing of
Exclusion Letter
 
its determination to exclude Allergan (this letter shall be referred to hereinafter as the "Exclusion Letter"). Subject to the Dispute Resolution provisions in Section X.E, below, the exclusion shall go into effect 30 days after the date of Allergan's receipt of the Exclusion Letter. The exclusion shall have national effect and shall also apply to all other Federal procurement and nonprocurement programs. Reinstatement to program participation is not automatic. After the end of the period of exclusion, Allergan may apply for reinstatement by submitting a written request for reinstatement in accordance with the provisions at 42 C.F.R.  1001.3001-.3004.
E.
Dispute Resolution
1. . Upon OIG's delivery to Allergan of its Demand Letter or of its Exclusion Letter, and as an agreed-upon contractual remedy for the resolution of disputes arising under this CIA, Allergan shall be afforded certain review rights comparable to the ones that are provided in 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7(f) and 42 C.F.R. Part 1005 as if they applied to the Stipulated Penalties or exclusion sought pursuant to this CIA. Specifically, OIG's determination to demand payment of Stipulated Penalties or to seek exclusion shall be subject to review by an HHS ALJ and, in the event of an appeal, the HHS Departmental Appeals Board (DAB), in a manner consistent with the provisions in 42 C.F.R.  1005.2-1005.21. Notwithstanding the language in 42 C.F.R.  1005.2(c), the request for a hearing involving Stipulated Penalties shall be made within 10 days after receipt of the Demand Letter and the request for a hearing involving exclusion shall be made within 25 days after receipt of the Exclusion Letter.
Review Rights
2. . Notwithstanding any provision of Title 42 of the United States Code or Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the only issues in a proceeding for Stipulated Penalties under this CIA shall be: (a) whether Allergan was in full and timely compliance with the obligations of this CIA for which OIG demands payment; and (b) the period of noncompliance. Allergan shall have the burden of proving its full and timely compliance and the steps taken to cure the noncompliance, if any. OIG shall not have the right to appeal to the DAB an adverse ALJ decision related to Stipulated Penalties. If the ALJ agrees with OIG with regard to a finding of a breach of this CIA and orders Allergan to pay Stipulated Penalties, such Stipulated Penalties shall become due and payable 20 days after the ALJ issues such a decision unless Allergan requests review of the ALJ decision by the DAB. If the ALJ decision is properly appealed to the DAB and the DAB upholds the determination of OIG, the
Stipulated Penalties Review
 
Stipulated Penalties shall become due and payable 20 days after the DAB issues its decision.
3. . Notwithstanding any provision of Title 42 of the United States Code or Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the only issues in a proceeding for exclusion based on a material breach of this CIA shall be:
Exclusion Review
a. whether Allergan was in material breach of this CIA;
b. whether such breach was continuing on the date of the Exclusion Letter; and
c. whether the alleged material breach could not have been cured within the 30-day period, but that: (i) Allergan had begun to take action to cure the material breach within that period; (ii) Allergan has pursued and is pursuing such action with due diligence; and (iii) Allergan provided to OIG within that period a reasonable timetable for curing the material breach and Allergan has followed the timetable.
For purposes of the exclusion herein, exclusion shall take effect only after an ALJ decision favorable to OIG, or, if the ALJ rules for Allergan, only after a DAB decision in favor of OIG. Allergan's election of its contractual right to appeal to the DAB shall not abrogate OIG's authority to exclude Allergan upon the issuance of an ALJ's decision in favor of OIG. If the ALJ sustains the determination of OIG and determines that exclusion is authorized, such exclusion shall take effect 20 days after the ALJ issues such a decision, notwithstanding that Allergan may request review of the ALJ decision by the DAB. If the DAB finds in favor of OIG after an ALJ decision adverse to OIG, the exclusion shall take effect 20 days after the DAB decision. Allergan shall waive its right to any notice of such an exclusion if a decision upholding the exclusion is rendered by the ALJ or DAB. If the DAB finds in favor of Allergan, Allergan shall be reinstated effective on the date of the original exclusion.
4. The review by an ALJ or DAB provided for above shall not be considered to be an appeal right arising under any statutes or regulations. Consequently, the parties to this CIA agree that the DAB's decision (or the ALJ's decision if not appealed) shall be considered final for all purposes under this CIA.
Finality of Decision.
 
Allergan and OIG agree as follows:
A. This CIA shall be binding on the successors, assigns, and transferees of Allergan;
B. This CIA shall become final and binding on the date the final signature is obtained on the CIA;
C. This CIA constitutes the complete agreement between the parties and may not be amended except by written consent of the parties to this CIA;
D. The undersigned Allergan signatories represent and warrant that they are authorized to execute this CIA. The undersigned OIG signatory represents that he is signing this CIA in his official capacity and that he is authorized to execute this CIA; and
E. This CIA may be executed in counterparts, each of which constitutes an original and all of which constitute one and the same CIA. Facsimiles of signatures shall constitute acceptable, binding signatures for purposes of this CIA.
 
 
 
 
 
This Appendix contains the requirements relating to the Independent Review Organization (IRO) required by Section III.D of the CIA.
 
Allergan shall engage an IRO that possesses the qualifications set forth in Paragraph B, below, to perform the responsibilities in Paragraph C, below. The IRO shall conduct the review in a professionally independent and objective fashion, as set forth in Paragraph D. Within 30 days after OIG receives written notice of the identity of the selected IRO, OIG will notify Allergan if the IRO is unacceptable. Absent notification from OIG that the IRO is unacceptable, Allergan may continue to engage the IRO.
If Allergan engages a new IRO during the term of the CIA, this IRO shall also meet the requirements of this Appendix. If a new IRO is engaged, Allergan shall submit the information identified in Section V.A.10 of the CIA to OIG within 30 days of engagement of the IRO. Within 30 days after OIG receives written notice of the identity of the selected IRO, OIG will notify Allergan if the IRO is unacceptable. Absent notification from OIG that the IRO is unacceptable, Allergan may continue to engage the IRO.
 
The IRO shall:
1. assign individuals to conduct the IRO Reviews who have expertise in all applicable Federal health care program and FDA requirements relating to Promotional Functions and to Product Related Functions. The assigned individuals shall also be knowledgeable about the general requirements of the Federal health care program(s) under which Allergan's Government Reimbursed Products are reimbursed;
2. assign individuals to design and select the samples for the Transaction Reviews who are knowledgeable about the appropriate statistical sampling techniques; and
3. have sufficient staff and resources to conduct the reviews required by the CIA on a timely basis.
 
The IRO shall:
1. perform each IRO Review in accordance with the specific requirements of the CIA;
2. follow all applicable Federal health care program and FDA requirements in making assessments in each IRO Review;
3. if in doubt of the application of a particular Federal health care program or FDA requirement, policy, or regulation, request clarification from the appropriate authority (, CMS or FDA);
e.g.
4. respond to all OIG inquires in a prompt, objective, and factual manner; and
5. prepare timely, clear, well-written reports that include all the information required by Appendix B to the CIA.
 
The IRO must perform the IRO Review in a professionally independent and objective fashion, as appropriate to the nature of the engagement, taking into account any other business relationships or engagements that may exist between the IRO and Allergan.
 
1. . If Allergan terminates its IRO during the course of the engagement, Allergan must submit a notice explaining its reasons to OIG no later than 30 days after termination. Allergan must engage a new IRO in accordance with Paragraph A of this Appendix.
Allergan Termination of IRO
2. In the event OIG has reason to believe that the IRO does not possess the qualifications described in Paragraph B, is not independent and/or objective as set forth in Paragraph D, or has failed to carry out its responsibilities as described in Paragraph C, OIG may, at its sole discretion, require Allergan to engage a new IRO in accordance with Paragraph A of this Appendix.
. OIG Removal of IRO
Prior to requiring Allergan to engage a new IRO, OIG shall notify Allergan of its intent to do so and provide a written explanation of why OIG believes such a step is necessary. To resolve any concerns raised by OIG, Allergan may request a meeting with OIG to discuss any aspect of the IRO's qualifications, independence or performance of its responsibilities and to present additional information regarding these matters. Allergan
 
shall provide any additional information as may be requested by OIG under this Paragraph in an expedited manner. OIG will attempt in good faith to resolve any differences regarding the IRO with Allergan prior to requiring Allergan to terminate the IRO. However, the final determination as to whether or not to require Allergan to engage a new IRO shall be made at the sole discretion of OIG.
 
 
As specified more fully below, Allergan shall retain an Independent Review Organization (IRO) to perform reviews to assist Allergan in assessing and evaluating its systems, processes, policies, procedures, and practices related to Allergan's Promotional and Product Related Functions (IRO Review). The IRO Review shall consist of two components - a systems review (the "Promotional and Product Related Systems Review" or "Systems Review"), and a transactions review (the "Promotional and Product Related Transactions Review" or "Transactions Review") as described more fully below. Allergan may engage, at its discretion, a single IRO to perform both components of the IRO Review provided that the entity has the necessary expertise and capabilities to perform both.
If there are no material changes in Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to Promotional and Product Related Functions, the IRO shall perform the Systems Review for the first and fourth Reporting Periods. If Allergan materially changes its systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to Promotional and Product Related Functions, the IRO shall perform a Systems Review for the Reporting Period(s) in which such changes were made in addition to conducting the Review for the first and fourth Reporting Periods. The additional Systems Review(s) described in Section III.D.1.b of the CIA shall consist of: 1) an identification of the material changes; 2) an assessment of whether other systems, processes, policies, and procedures previously reported did not materially change; and 3) a review of the systems, processes, policies, and procedures that materially changed. The IRO shall conduct the Transactions Review for each Reporting Period of the CIA.
 
 
The Promotional and Product Related Systems Review shall be a review of Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures (including the controls on those systems, processes, policies, and procedures) relating to certain Promotional and Product Related Functions. Where practical, Allergan personnel may compile documentation, schedule and organize interviews, and undertake other efforts to assist the IRO in performing the Systems Review. The IRO is not required to undertake a de novo review of the information gathered or activities undertaken by Allergan pursuant to the preceding sentence.
 
Specifically, the IRO shall review Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures associated with the following (hereafter "Reviewed Policies and Procedures"):
1)        Allergan's systems, policies, processes, and procedures applicable to the manner in which Allergan sales representatives handle and submit requests or inquiries to Medical Affairs relating to information about the uses of products (including non-FDA-approved (, off-label) uses) and the dissemination of materials relating to off-label uses of products. This review includes:
i.e.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)        Allergan's systems, processes, policies and procedures applicable to the manner and circumstances under which personnel from Medical Affairs (, Regional Scientific Services, or RSS) interact with or participate in meetings or events with HCPs or HCIs (either alone or with sales
e.g.
 
representatives) and the role of the medical personnel at such meetings or events, including the manner in which they handle responses to unsolicited requests about off-label indications of Products. This includes any Medical Affairs Monitoring Plan designed to monitor the activities of the RSMs;
3)        Allergan's systems, policies, processes, and procedures relating to Allergan's internal review and approval of information and materials related to products disseminated to HCPs or HCIs by Allergan;
4)        Allergan's systems, processes, polices, and procedures relating to incentive compensation for Relevant Covered Persons who are sales representatives, with regard to whether the systems, policies, processes, and procedures are designed to ensure that financial incentives do not inappropriately motivate such individuals to engage in the improper promotion, sales, and marketing of Allergan's products. This shall include a review of the bases upon which compensation is determined and the extent to which compensation is based on product performance. To the extent that Allergan establishes different systems, processes, policies, or procedures relating to compensation for different products, the IRO shall review each type of compensation arrangement separately;
5)        Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to the development and review of Call Plans (as defined in Section III.B.3.j of the CIA). This shall include a review of the bases upon which HCPs and HCIs belonging to specified medical specialties are included in, or excluded from, the Call Plans based on, among other factors, expected utilization of products for FDA-approved uses or non-FDA-approved uses;
6)        Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to sample distribution. This shall include a review of the bases upon, and circumstances under, which HCPs and HCIs belonging to specified medical specialties or types of clinical practice may receive samples from Allergan (including, separately, from Allergan sales representatives and other Allergan personnel or components). It shall also include a review of whether samples of Products are distributed by Allergan through sales representatives or are distributed from a central location and the rationale for the manner of distribution;
7)        Allergan's systems (including any centralized electronic system), processes, policies, and procedures relating to speaker programs, speaker training programs, and all events and expenses relating to such engagements or arrangements;
 
8)        Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to non-speaker related consultant or other fee-for-service arrangements entered into with HCPs or HCIs (including, but not limited to, presentations, consultant task force meetings, advisory boards, preceptorships, mentorships (if any), and ad hoc advisory activities, and any other financial engagement or arrangement with an HCP or HCI) and all events and expenses relating to such engagements or arrangements;
9)        Allergan's systems, processes, policies and procedures relating to the submission of information about any product to any compendia such as Drugdex or other published source of information used in connection with the determination of coverage by a Federal health care program for the Product ("Compendia"). This includes any initial submission of information to any Compendia and the submission of any additional, updated, supplemental, or changed information, (, any changes based on Allergan's discovery of erroneous or scientifically unsound information or data associated with the information in the Compendia.) The review shall also assess Allergan's processes relating to its annual review of all arrangement, processing fees, or other payments or financial support (if any) provided by the company to any Compendia;
e.g.
10)        Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to investigator-initiated trials (IITs) including the decision to provide financial or other support for those studies; the manner in which support is provided for the IITs; and support for publication of the information about those studies, including publication of information about the trial outcomes and results and the uses made of publications relating to those studies;
11)        Allergan's systems, processes, policies and procedures relating to authorship or any articles or other publications about products or therapeutic areas or disease states that may be treated with products, including, but not limited to, the disclosure of any and all relationships between the author and Allergan, the identification of all authors or contributors (including professional writer, if any) associated with a given publication, and the scope and breadth of research results made available to each author or contributor; and
12) Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to the provision of reimbursement support services, including the controls around the provision of such services; the manner in which Allergan provides reimbursement support services; the frequency with which Allergan provides such services; and the determination about which HCPs or HCIs will be eligible to receive such services. The review shall also assess
 
Allergan's processes relating to its annual review of reimbursement support services as referenced in Section III.B.3.f of the CIA.
 
The IRO shall prepare a report based upon each Systems Review. For each of the Reviewed Policies and Procedures identified in Section II.A above, the report shall include the following items:
1)        a description of the documentation (including policies) reviewed and any personnel interviewed;
2)        a detailed description of Allergan's systems, policies, processes, and procedures relating to the items identified in Sections II.A.1-12 above, including a general description of Allergan's control and accountability systems (, documentation and approval requirements, and tracking mechanisms) and written policies regarding the Reviewed Policies and Procedures;
e.g.
3)        a description of the manner in which the control and accountability systems and the written policies relating to the items identified in Sections II.A.1-12 above are made known or disseminated within Allergan;
4)        a detailed description of any system(s) used to track and respond to requests for information about Allergan's products (including the Inquiries Database);
5)        a detailed description of Allergan's incentive compensation system for Covered Persons who are sales representatives, including a description of the bases upon which compensation is determined and the extent to which compensation is based on product performance. To the extent that Allergan may establish compensation differently for individual products, the IRO shall report separately on each such type of compensation arrangement;
6)        findings and supporting rationale regarding any weaknesses in Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures relating to the Reviewed Policies and Procedures, if any; and
7)        recommendations to improve any of the systems, policies, processes, or procedures relating to the Reviewed Policies and Procedures, if any.
 
As described more fully below in Sections III.A-E, the Transactions Review shall include: (1) a review of a sample of Inquiries reflected in the Inquiries Database; (2) a review of Allergan's Call Plans and Allergan's Call Plan review process; (3) a review of Sampling Events as defined below in Section III.C; (4) a review of records relating to a sample of the Payments that are reported by Allergan pursuant to Section III.M of the CIA; and (5) a review of up to three additional items identified by the OIG in accordance with Section III.D.1.b of the CIA (hereafter "Additional Items".) The IRO shall report on all aspects of its reviews in the Promotional and Product Related Transactions Review Reports.
 
 
As set forth in Section III.B.3.h of the CIA, Allergan shall establish a database (Inquiries Database) to track information relating to all requests for information received by Allergan about its products (Inquiries). Allergan shall record in the Inquiries Database the following information for each Inquiry received: 1) date of Inquiry; 2) form of Inquiry (, fax, phone, medical information request form); 3) name of requesting HCP or HCI; 4) nature and topic of request including exact language of the Inquiry (if made in writing); 5) nature/form of the response from Allergan (including a record of any materials provided in response to the request); and 6) the name of the Allergan representative who called upon or interacted with the HCP or HCI, if known.
e.g.
 
On a semi-annual basis, the Chief Compliance Officer, or a designee, shall review the Inquiries Database and related information, as appropriate, and shall generate a report summarizing the items of information outlined in Section III.A.1 above for each Inquiry received during the preceding two quarters (Inquiry Report). The Chief Compliance Officer shall review the Inquiry Reports to assess whether the information contained in the report suggests that improper off-label promotion may have occurred in connection with any Inquiry(ies). If the Chief Compliance Officer, in consultation with other appropriate Allergan personnel, suspects that improper off-label promotion may have occurred in connection with any Inquiry, the Chief Compliance Officer shall initiate a follow-up review of the Inquiry (Off-Label Review), make specific findings based on his/her Off-Label Review, and take all appropriate responsive action (including
 
disciplinary action of the Covered Person and reporting of the conduct, including disclosing Reportable Events pursuant to Section III.H of the CIA, if applicable).
 
The IRO shall select and review a random sample of 50 Inquiries from among the Inquiries reflected in the Inquiries Database for each Reporting Period. Forty of the Inquiries reviewed by the IRO shall be Inquiries for which Allergan conducted an Off-Label Review, and the other 10 shall be Inquiries for which Allergan did not conduct an Off-Label Review. For each Inquiry reviewed, the IRO shall determine:
 
 
 
The IRO shall conduct a review and assessment of Allergan's review of its Call Plans as set forth in Section III.B.3.j of the CIA. Allergan shall provide the IRO with: i) a list of products promoted by Allergan during the Reporting Period; ii) information about the FDA-approved uses for each Allergan product; and iii) the Call Plans for each product. Allergan shall also provide the IRO with information about the reviews of Call Plans that Allergan conducted during the Reporting Period and any modifications to the Call Plans made as a result of Allergan's reviews.
For each Call Plan, the IRO shall select a sample of 50 of the HCPs and HCIs included on the Call Plan. For each Call Plan, the IRO shall compare the sampled HCPs and HCIs against the criteria (, medical specialty or practice area) used by Allergan in conducting its review and/or modification of the Call Plan in order to determine whether Allergan followed its criteria and Policies and Procedures in reviewing and modifying the Call Plan.
e.g.
The IRO shall note any instances in which it appears that the sampled HCPs and HCIs on a particular Call Plan are inconsistent with Allergan's criteria relating to the Call
 
Plan and/or Allergan's Policies and Procedures. The IRO shall also note any instances in which it appears that Allergan failed to follow its criteria or Policies and Procedures.
 
The IRO shall conduct a review and assessment of the distribution of samples of Allergan products to HCPs and HCIs. Allergan shall provide the IRO with: i) a list of products for which Allergan distributed samples during the Reporting Period; ii) information about the FDA-approved uses for each Allergan product; and iii) information about Allergan's policies and procedures relating to the distribution of samples of each type of product, including Allergan's Call Plan showing which particular medical specialties or types of clinical practices are eligible to receive samples. Allergan shall also provide the IRO with information about the reviews of Call Plans that Allergan conducted during the Reporting Period and any modifications to the plans made as a result of Allergan's reviews.
For each product for which Allergan distributed samples during the Reporting Period, the IRO shall randomly select a sample of 30 separate instances in which Allergan provided samples of the product to HCPs or HCIs. Each such instance shall be known as a "Sampling Event."
For each Sampling Event, the IRO shall review all documents and information relating to the distribution of the sample to the HCP or HCI. The reviewed materials shall include materials about the following: 1) the quantity, dosage, and form of the Allergan product provided to the HCP or HCI; 2) the identity and type of medical specialty or clinical practice of the HCP or HCI; 3) which individual Allergan sales representative or department (, medical services) provided the sample to the HCP or HCI; 4) the manner and mechanism through which the sample was requested (e.g., sample request form, letter or call to Medical Information department); and 5) the manner and mechanism through which the request was fulfilled ( sales representative distribution or direct shipment.)
e.g.
e.g.,
For each Sampling Event, the IRO shall evaluate whether the sample was provided to an HCP or HCI whose medical specialty or clinical practice is consistent with the uses of the product approved by the FDA and whether the sample was distributed by a Allergan representative in a manner consistent with Allergan's sample distribution policy for the product(s) provided during the Sampling Event. To the extent that a sample was provided to an HCP or HCI by an Allergan representative other than a sales representative, the IRO shall contact the HCP or HCI by letter. The letter shall request that the HCP or HCI: 1) verify that he/she/it received the quantity and type of samples identified by the IRO as the Sampling Event; 2) verify that he/she/it requested the samples provided during the Sampling Event; 3) explain or confirm its type of medical specialty or clinical practice; and 4) identify the basis for requesting the sample (,
e.g.
 
conversations with a Allergan sales representative, conversation with a representative of Allergan's Medical Information department, independent research or knowledge of the HCP or HCI, .)
etc
For each Sampling Event, the IRO shall compare the medical specialty and type of clinical practice of the HCPs and HCIs that received the sample with uses of the product approved by the FDA. The IRO shall note any instances in which it appears that the medical specialty or clinical practice of the HCPs or HCIs that received a sample during a Sampling Event were not consistent with the uses of the product approved by the FDA. For each such situation, the IRO shall note the process followed by Allergan in determining that it was appropriate to provide a sample to such HCP or HCI and the basis for such determination. The IRO shall also note any instances in which it appears that Allergan failed to follow its Call Plan for the product(s) provided during the Sampling Event.
 
 
As set forth in Section III.M of the CIA, in phases, Allergan shall post quarterly and annual listings of physicians and Related Entities who received Payments, as defined in the CIA, directly or indirectly from Allergan. For purposes of the IRO review as set forth in this Section III.D, each annual listing shall be referred to as the "Physician Payment Listing" or "Listing." For each physician and Related Entity, each Physician Payment Listing shall include the following information: i) full name; ii) name of Related Entity (if applicable); iii) city and state of the physician's practice or the Related Entity; and iv) the aggregate value of the Payment(s) in the preceding year.
For purposes of this IRO review, the term "Control Documents" shall include all documents or electronic records associated with each Payment reflected in the Physician Payments Listing for the sampled physician and/or Related Entity. For example, the term "Control Documents" includes, but is not limited to, documents relating to the nature, purpose, and amount of all Payments reflected in the Listing; contracts relating to the Payment(s) reflected in the Listing; documents relating to the occurrence of Payment(s) reflected in the Listing; documents reflecting any work product generated in connection with the Payment(s); documents submitted by sales representatives or headquarters personnel to request approval for the Payment(s); and business rationale or justification forms relating to the Payment(s).
 
For each Reporting Period, the OIG shall have the discretion to identify up to 50 physicians or Related Entities from the applicable Physician Payment Listing that will be
 
subject to the IRO review described below. If the OIG elects to exercise this discretion, it shall notify the IRO of the physicians and/or Related Entities subject to the IRO review. If the OIG elects not to exercise its discretion as described above, the IRO shall randomly select 50 physicians and/or Related Entities to be included in the review. For each selected physician and/or Related Entity, the IRO shall review the entry in the Physician Payment Listing and the Control Documents relating to Payments reflected in Listing identified by the IRO as necessary and sufficient to validate the Payment information in the Listing.
 
For each physician and/or Related Entity selected as part of the sample, the IRO shall review the Control Documents identified by the IRO as necessary and sufficient to validate each Payment reflected in the Listing to evaluate the following:
 
 
 
 
 
A Material Error is defined as any of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
If a Control Document does not exist, but Allergan has initiated corrective action prior to the selection of the sampled physicians and/or Related Entities, or if a Control Document does not exist but the IRO can determine that Allergan otherwise followed its policies and procedures with regard to each entry in the Listing for a sampled physician or Related Entity, the IRO shall consider such a situation to be an exception (rather than a Material Error) and the IRO shall report the situation as such. Similarly, the IRO shall note as exceptions any Control Documents for which non-material information or data is omitted.
If the IRO identifies any Material Errors, the IRO shall conduct such Additional Review of the underlying Payment associated with the erroneous Control Documents as may be necessary to determine the root cause of the Material Errors. For example, the IRO may need to review additional documentation and/or conduct interviews with appropriate personnel to identify the root cause of the Material Error(s) discovered.
 
As set forth in Section III.D.1.b of the CIA, for each Reporting Period, the OIG at its discretion may identify up to three additional items for the IRO to review (hereafter "Additional Items".) No later than 150 days prior to the end of the applicable Reporting Period, the OIG shall notify Allergan of the nature and scope of the IRO review to be conducted for each of the Additional Items. Prior to undertaking the review of the Additional Items, the IRO and/or Allergan shall submit an audit work plan to the OIG for approval and the IRO shall conduct the review of the Additional Items based on a work plan approved by the OIG. The IRO shall include information about its review of each Additional Item in the Transactions Review Report (including a description of the review conducted for each Additional Item; the IRO's findings based on its review for each Additional Item; and the IRO's recommendations for any changes in Allergan's systems, processes, policies, and procedures based on its review of each Additional Item.)
Allergan may propose to the OIG that its internal audit(s) and/or reviews conducted as part of the Field Force Monitoring Program (FFMP) described in Section III.J of the CIA or the Non-Promotional Monitoring Program described in Section III.K of the CIA be substituted for one or more of the Additional Items that would otherwise be
 
reviewed by the IRO for the applicable Reporting Period. The OIG retains sole discretion over whether, and in what manner, to allow Allergan's internal audit work and monitoring activities to be substituted for a portion of the Additional Items review conducted by the IRO.
In making its decision, the OIG agrees to consider, among other factors, the nature and scope of Allergan's planned monitoring activities and internal audit work, the results of the Transactions Review(s) during prior Reporting Period(s), and Allergan's demonstrated audit capabilities to perform the proposed audit work internally. If the OIG denies Allergan's request to permit its monitoring activities or internal audit work to be substituted for a portion of the IRO's review of Additional Items in a given Reporting Period, Allergan shall engage the IRO to perform the Review as outlined in this Section III.
If the OIG agrees to permit certain of Allergan's monitoring activities or internal audit work for a given Reporting Period to be substituted for a portion of Additional Items review, such internal work would be subject to verification by the IRO (Verification Review). In such an instance, the OIG would provide additional details about the scope of the Verification Review to be conducted by the IRO. However, for purposes of any Verification Review, the IRO shall review at least 20% of the sampling units reviewed by Allergan in its internal audits.

Northern District of Georgia
 
 
The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia as counsel for the United States, and Defendant ("Defendant" or , hereby enter into this Plea Agreement pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Defendant, having received a copy of the above-numbered Criminal Information and having been arraigned, hereby pleads GUILTY to Count One of the Criminal Information thereof.
ALLERGAN, INC.
"ALLERGAN")
1.       The Defendant admits that it is pleading guilty because it is in fact guilty of the crime charged in Count One of the Criminal Information.
2.       The Defendant understands its rights and understands that by pleading guilty pursuant to this Plea Agreement, it is giving up a number of rights including the right:
(a)       to plead not guilty to the criminal charge brought against it;
(b)       to have a trial by jury, at which it would be presumed not guilty of the charge and the United States would have to prove every essential element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt for it to be found guilty;
(c)       to confront and cross-examine witnesses against it and to subpoena witnesses in its defense at trial;
(d)       to pursue any affirmative defenses, Fourth Amendment or Fifth Amendment claims, and other pretrial motions that have been filed or could have been filed;.
(e)       to appeal its conviction if it is found guilty; and
(f)       to appeal the imposition of sentence against it.
Subject to this Court's approval of this Plea Agreement, the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives the rights set out in Paragraph 2(a)-(f) above.
The Defendant understands that by pleading guilty pursuant to this Plea Agreement, it is giving up all of these rights and there will not be a trial of any kind.
The Defendant also understands that it ordinarily would have the right to appeal its sentence and, under some circumstances, to attack the conviction and sentence in post-conviction proceedings. By entering this Plea Agreement, the Defendant may be waiving some or all of those rights to appeal and to collaterally attack its conviction and sentence, as specified below.
Finally, the Defendant understands that to plead guilty, it will, through a duly authorized corporate representative, have to answer, under oath, questions posed by the Court concerning the rights that the Defendant is giving up and the facts of this case, and the Defendant's answers, if untruthful, may later be used against it.
3.       The Defendant understands that, based on its plea of guilty to Count One of the Criminal Information, the statutory maximum penalty which may be imposed against it upon conviction is the following:
(a)       Maximum Fine: $200,000; or twice the gross pecuniary gain derived from the crime, or twice the gross pecuniary loss caused to the victims of the crime (18 U.S.C.
 
 3571(c) and (d)), whichever is larger;
(b)       Term of Probation: Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  3561(c)(2), the Court may impose a term of probation of not more than five years;
(c)       Mandatory special assessment: $125.00 due and payable immediately; and
(d)       Forfeiture of all misbranded drugs involved in the offense or substitute assets.
The Defendant understands that, before imposing sentence in this case, the Court will be required to consider, among other factors, the provisions of the United States Sentencing Guidelines to the extent applicable to this offense and that the Court has the discretion to depart or vary from those Guidelines.
4.       The Defendant, its counsel, and the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia ("Government"), as counsel for the United States, subject to approval by the Court, have agreed upon a negotiated plea in this case, the terms of which are as follows:
5.

for the Northern District of Georgia as of the date of the execution of this Plea Agreement. The Defendant understands that this provision does not bar prosecution by any state or local jurisdiction and the non-prosecution terms of this paragraph do not apply to civil matters of any kind, to any violation of the federal tax or securities laws, or to any crime of violence. Further, the Defendant understands that the United States takes no position as to the proper tax treatment of any of the payments made by the Defendant pursuant to this Plea Agreement, the Civil Settlement Agreement, or the Corporate Integrity Agreement referenced in this Plea Agreement.
6.       The Defendant agrees to waive as set forth in this Paragraph the statute of limitations, and any other time-related defense, to the charge to which it is agreeing to plead guilty under this Plea Agreement. The Defendant understands and agrees that, should it seek to withdraw its plea, it may then be prosecuted for any criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge arising out of this investigation, subject to any applicable statute of limitation or other time-related protection not waived in this paragraph. The Defendant agrees that if it does not enter its plea, or withdraws its plea, after signing this agreement, the time period between April 08, 2010 and its withdrawal shall be excluded from calculation of the limitations or time period.
7.       The Defendant or anyone acting on its behalf also waives all rights, whether asserted directly or by a representative, to request or receive from any department or agency of the United States any records pertaining to the investigation or prosecution of this case, including without limitation any records that may be sought under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  552, or the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.  552a.
 
8.      Based upon the evidence currently known to the Government, the Government and the Defendant agree that the 2009 version of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual is the appropriate Guidelines Manual to utilize.

The Government and the Defendant agree that this fine and forfeiture amount represent a fair and just resolution of all issues associated with loss/gain and forfeiture calculations.
ALLERGAN
ALLERGAN
(b)       agrees that as a result of its acts or omissions, the forfeitable property, that is the drugs which were misbranded, are no longer available for forfeiture as they cannot be located or have been transferred, sold or deposited with a third party, or otherwise disposed of, within the meaning of federal law. As a result, agrees to the entry and satisfaction of a judgment and preliminary order of forfeiture on the date of the guilty plea, forfeiting to the United States the sum of $25,000,000 as substitute assets for the pertinent drugs. agrees that, within 10 business days of the date of sentencing, will make payment to the United States, by means of a wire transfer to the United States Marshal Service

or check payable to same, in the amount of $25,000,000, this amount representing substitute assets of the offense for which it is pleading guilty, in full satisfaction of the judgment and preliminary order of forfeiture.

The forfeiture set forth herein shall not satisfy or offset any fine, or other penalty imposed upon , nor shall the forfeiture be used to offset 's tax liability or any other debt owed to the United States. agrees to consent to the entry of an order of forfeiture for the $25,000,000.00 in United States currency, and waives the requirements of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 32.2 and 43(a) regarding notice of the forfeiture in the charging instrument, entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture, announcement of the forfeiture at sentencing, and incorporation of the forfeiture in the judgment. acknowledges that it understands that the forfeiture of assets is part of the sentence that may be imposed in this case and waives any failure by the Court to advise it of this, pursuant to Rule 11 (b)(1)(J), at the time the guilty plea is accepted.

interest, the parties agree that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process that would result from an attempt to fashion a restitution order outweighs the need to provide restitution to the non-federal victims of this case, if any.

(e)      The Government recommends that in light of the Corporate Integrity Agreement executed contemporaneously with this guilty Plea Agreement, should not be placed on probation.

P. 11 regarding the guilty plea or this Plea Agreement or made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the Government shall not be admissible against the Defendant in any criminal or civil proceeding, except as otherwise provided in Fed. R. Evid. 410.

The Defendant understands that this Plea Agreement does not limit the Government's right to appeal, but if the Government initiates a direct appeal of the sentence imposed, the Defendant may file a cross-appeal of that same sentence.
ALLERGAN

Exhibit 99.1
(IRVINE, Calif., September 1, 2010)  Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN) today announced that it has reached a resolution with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the previously reported Government investigation into Allergan's past U.S. sales and marketing practices relating to certain therapeutic uses of BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA).
Allergan has been cooperating with the Government in a multi-year investigation in Atlanta, Georgia, regarding the use of BOTOX for certain therapeutic treatments covering a period that commenced in January of 2000. The parties have resolved all issues involved in the investigation by entering into a global settlement, which includes the following:
Allergan has agreed to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor "misbranding" charge covering the period 2000 through 2005 and pay to the Government $375 million. This misbranding charge is known as a strict liability offense, and does not involve false or deceptive conduct. A prescription drug is deemed misbranded when its labeling does not contain adequate directions for its "intended uses," and, under the Government's view, a use that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved (i.e., an "off-label" use) may be deemed "intended" based on written or oral statements made by the manufacturer. As part of its plea, Allergan has agreed that between 2000 through 2005, its marketing of BOTOX resulted in intended uses for the therapeutic treatment of headache, pain, spasticity and juvenile cerebral palsy. These uses were off label during the relevant time frame and thus the labeling for BOTOX did not bear directions for these intended uses, resulting in the product being misbranded. In March 2010, the FDA approved BOTOX for the treatment of increased muscle stiffness in the elbow, wrist and fingers in adults with upper limb spasticity, the most substantial use during the relevant time period, and thus its label now includes directions for that use. Based on positive Phase III trials announced in September 2008, Allergan has filed for FDA approval of BOTOX for the treatment of chronic migraine and expects FDA to rule on the application in 2010. Allergan is also in Phase III clinical trials investigating the use of BOTOX to treat neurogenic and idiopathic overactive bladder. Although BOTOX is approved in 70 countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Hong Kong, and recently Japan, to treat symptoms associated with juvenile cerebral palsy, it is currently off label in the United States. Allergan is in discussions with the FDA regarding additional clinical development for juvenile cerebral palsy in the United States.
In addition, Allergan has agreed to pay $225 million to resolve civil claims asserted by DOJ under the civil False Claims Act. The civil settlement is an element of a global settlement that Allergan believes is in the best interest of its stockholders. However, Allergan denies liability associated with these civil allegations and does not believe there is merit to them factually or legally.
To resolve the criminal and civil investigation, Allergan was required by the Government to dismiss Allergan's First Amendment lawsuit pending in Washington, D.C., in which Allergan sought a ruling that it could proactively share truthful scientific and medical information with the medical community to assist physicians in evaluating the risks and benefits if they choose to use BOTOX off label to treat certain forms of spasticity. Allergan is disappointed that the court was not afforded an opportunity to hear and rule on these important First Amendment issues, as Allergan believes that physicians, patients, manufacturers, payers, and ultimately the quality of evidence-based medicine itself would have benefited from a ruling clarifying the law.
Allergan is committed to conducting its business consistent with high ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws. In an effort to meet its compliance goals, Allergan has a robust and regularly reviewed and updated compliance program. Allergan has further enhanced its compliance program by developing additional comprehensive policies and procedures, supported by significant technology investments, including its state-of-the-art Business Execution Automated Compliance Navigator (BEACON) compliance system.
As part of its global settlement, Allergan has entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Under the CIA, Allergan will maintain its current compliance program and undertake a series of compliance-related obligations, including additional monitoring, maintenance of specific written standards, auditing, training, education, reporting and disclosure, for five years. The CIA also provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on Allergan's compliance program.
"This settlement is in the best interest of our stockholders as it resolves all matters at issue in the investigation, avoids substantial costs of litigation, as well as the substantial risks to Allergan associated with Government enforcement action in these matters, and permits us to focus our time and resources on productively developing new treatments for patients and the medical community," said Douglas S. Ingram, Allergan's Executive Vice President.
Allergan currently estimates that it will record total non-recurring pre-tax charges of between approximately $610 million and $615 million in its third fiscal quarter in connection with the global settlement with the DOJ. This amount includes estimated interest and certain attorneys' fees that Allergan is obligated to pay in connection with the global settlement, but excludes Allergan's ongoing administrative legal fees and other costs. Allergan is presently determining the tax treatment of the global settlement charges. As such, the tax impact of such charges cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Allergan currently expects to pay the global settlement costs in its fourth fiscal quarter.
The criminal resolution is subject to approval by the federal court in Northern District of Georgia, and the civil settlement is contingent upon such approval.
About BOTOX
BOTOX is a prescription-only medical product that contains tiny amounts of highly purified botulinum toxin protein refined from the bacterium, . BOTOX has a unique, protected molecular structure that stabilizes the core toxin in BOTOX from degradation. When injected at approved and labeled doses into a specific muscle or gland, BOTOX neurotoxin is expected to diffuse locally and expected to produce a safe and effective result by producing a localized and temporary reduction in the overacting muscle or gland, usually lasting up to approximately 3 to 6.7 months depending on the individual patient and indication.
Clostridium botulinum
BOTOX was first approved by the FDA 20 years ago for the treatment of strabismus and blepharospasm, two eye muscle disorders, making it the first botulinum toxin type A product approved in the world. Since its first approval, BOTOX has been recognized by regulatory authorities worldwide as an effective treatment for 21 different indications in approximately 80 countries, benefiting patients worldwide. In the United States, BOTOX is also approved to treat the abnormal head position and neck pain that happens with cervical dystonia (CD) in adults, symptoms of severe underarm sweating (severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) when medicines used on the skin (topical) do not work well enough, and increased muscle stiffness in elbow, wrist and finger muscles in adults with upper limb spasticity.
In addition to its therapeutic uses, the same formulation of BOTOX with dosing specific to glabellar lines was approved by the FDA in 2002 under the trade name BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA).
In addition to 20 years of clinical experience, the safety and efficacy of BOTOX have been well-established in approximately 50 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and in approximately 11,000 patients treated with BOTOX and BOTOX Cosmetic in Allergan's clinical trials
