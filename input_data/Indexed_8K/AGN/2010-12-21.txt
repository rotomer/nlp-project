Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 17, 2010, Allergan, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Allergan, Inc. Executive Severance Pay Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2011, which revises the Company's prior severance policy. The Plan entitles the Company's Chief Executive Officer, President and each Executive Vice President (which includes our named executive officers) (each, a "Participant"), whose employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, to receive severance payments and other benefits, subject to certain limitations.
The Plan provides each Participant the right to receive a lump-sum cash severance payment on the fifty-fifth (55
th
) day immediately following such Participant's involuntary termination, in an amount equal to 12 to 24 months (the "Severance Pay Period") of the Participant's base salary at the time of termination, based upon the Participant's years of credited service at the Company. The Participant's receipt of severance benefits under the Plan is subject to such Participant's execution and non-revocation of a Severance and General Release Agreement, substantially in the form attached to the Plan as Appendix B, and further subject to certain other limitations, as detailed in the Plan. Under the Plan, the treatment of the Participant's outstanding equity awards and bonus payment consideration, if any, are subject to and paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable grant or plan. The Participants are entitled to receive coverage under certain health care benefit plans for the duration of the Participant's Severance Pay Period; provided that such Participant pays the required participant contributions for such coverage. The Participants are also entitled to receive outplacement counseling services for a period determined by the Company. A Participant cannot receive benefits under the Plan to the extent the Participant becomes eligible to receive severance benefits from the Company under any plan, program or arrangement other than the Plan in connection with the Participant's termination.
The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Plan attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01.    Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Effective as of May 3, 1993, Allergan, Inc. (the "Company") revised its severance policy as applied to senior executives of the Company. Effective as of January 1, 2011 (the "Effective Date"), the Company hereby adopts this Executive Severance Pay Plan (the "Plan") to document and update its severance policy for senior executives.
 
For purposes of the Plan, the following terms shall have the respective meanings set forth below:
A.          "Board" shall mean the Company's Board of Directors.
B.

By way of example, an Executive with 8 years and 10 months of employment with the Company as of the date of his or her Involuntary Termination would be credited with 8 Years of Credited Service.
 
Each individual who is an Executive as of the Effective Date shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Any individual who becomes an Executive on or after the Effective Date shall thereafter be eligible to participate in the Plan.
Subject to the terms and conditions herein, an Executive who incurs an Involuntary Termination shall be eligible to receive the severance benefits described in Section III below provided the Executive executes a Release that becomes irrevocable on or before the payment date specified in Section III.A.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent required by the Release, the Release will not be treated as irrevocable for the purposes of this Plan prior to the date that is seven (7) calendar days after the Executive has provided proof that he or she has withdrawn or dismissed any pending claims or actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section II, an Executive shall not be eligible to receive benefits under the Plan if he or she either (i) incurs an Involuntary Termination in connection with the sale of a Company business unit and the entity that acquires such business unit offers the Executive a position with the acquiring entity or any affiliate thereof that is comparable to the Executive's position with the Company as of the date of his or her Involuntary Termination, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion; or (ii) incurs an Involuntary Termination without Cause and becomes eligible to receive severance benefits from the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) under any plan, program or arrangement other than the Plan (including any applicable change in control agreement or policy) in connection with such termination.
 
 
 
Severance pay is calculated as a specified number months of Current Base Salary based upon the Executive's aggregate Years of Credited Service as of the date of his or her Involuntary Termination. An Executive will be entitled to the number of months of Current Base Salary determined in accordance with the chart attached at .
Appendix A
 
The Executive's severance pay shall be paid to him in a single lump sum on the fifty-fifth (55
th
) day immediately following his Involuntary Termination.
 
 
 
Unless otherwise provided herein, the terms and conditions of each Company (or affiliate, if applicable) benefit plan, program or arrangement in which the Executive participated as of the date upon which the Executive incurred an Involuntary Termination shall govern with respect to the effect of the Executive's Involuntary Termination under such plan, program or arrangement.
 
Capitalized terms used in this subsection B.2 that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Welfare Plan.
 
Each Executive covered by the Welfare Plan may continue his or her existing dental and/or vision coverage and continue or elect coverage under the Allergan Medical Program (but not the Allergan Insured HMO/PPO Medical Program) during his or her Severance Pay Period in accordance with section 4.5 of the Welfare Plan. The Executive also may continue coverage under the Allergan Health Care Flexible Spending Account Program through the last day of the Plan Year in which the Executive incurs an Involuntary Termination.
 
(1)          Any Executive who receives continued medical, dental and/or vision coverage (including coverage under the Allergan Health Care Flexible Spending Account Program) during his or her Severance Pay Period shall be responsible to pay the required Participant Contributions for such coverage. In accordance with the terms of the Welfare Plan, the Executive's Participant Contributions for continued coverage during an applicable calendar year shall be deducted from the Executive's severance pay (or, if none is available, any other cash compensation) paid during that Plan Year (or in the following Plan Year if the Executive's severance pay is paid in the Plan Year following the year in which the Executive incurs an Involuntary Termination ), provided that: (i) Participant Contributions shall be deducted on an after-tax basis, and (ii) any Company Contributions shall be treated as amounts that were received by the Executive as taxable cash compensation and then paid back to the Welfare Plan by the Executive; provided further, however, that if the Executive does not elect coverage under the Allergan Medical Program and/or the Allergan Dental Program, but does elect coverage under the Allergan Vision Program, the Executive's share of premiums for vision coverage shall be deducted on a pre-tax basis and made as Flex Deposits and any Company Contributions toward that vision coverage shall not be taxable. Any taxes that would be required to be withheld with regard to such Company Contributions for coverage to be provided during a calendar year shall be withheld from the severance pay or other compensation paid during that year (and, in the absence of any such severance
 
pay or other compensation, the Executive shall be required to remit such taxes to the Company).
(2)          If the Executive's coverage continues for part or all of a Plan Year that begins after the Executive receives his or her severance payment, and the Executive does not receive other compensation from the Company from which Participant Contributions may be deducted, the Executive shall pay the required Participant Contributions directly to the Welfare Plan on an after-tax basis in accordance with the terms of the Welfare Plan.
(3)          If an Executive elects to waive coverage during a calendar year in accordance with the terms of the Welfare Plan, the Executive shall receive a refund of Participant Contributions already made for the coverage period beginning on the later of the day after he or she files the election change or the date he or she becomes covered under another group health plan. Any refund of Flex Deposits made in accordance with this paragraph for a calendar year shall be made by no later than December 31 of that year.
(4)          In the event the Company amends the Welfare Plan or any benefit plan or program provided thereunder on or after the Effective Date and the terms of such amended plan or program conflict with those described in subsections (1) through (3) above, the terms of the amended plan or program shall govern.
 
Any outstanding equity awards granted to an Executive under the Allergan, Inc. 2008 Incentive Award Plan, or any successor thereto ("IAP") shall vest in accordance with the terms of the IAP and the terms and conditions of the applicable grant.
 
An Executive who receives severance pay pursuant to Section III.A may be eligible for Management Bonus consideration for the year in which his Involuntary Termination occurs, subject to the terms set forth in the Management Bonus Plan or Executive Bonus Plan, as applicable.
 
Each Executive shall be eligible to receive outplacement counseling for a period determined by the Company. The Company shall arrange and authorize counseling at the provider of its choice.
 
 
To the extent permitted by law, the Company may deduct from an Executive's severance pay any outstanding debt owed by the Executive to the Company.
 
 
Any payments, benefits or reimbursements that become payable hereunder shall be subject to withholding for applicable taxes and any other required payroll deductions.
 
If an Executive is rehired by the Company, any affiliate of the Company or any successor to all or any part of the Company's business prior to the end of the Severance Pay Period, the Executive shall reimburse the Company for the balance of the severance pay that the Executive received pursuant to Section III.A above. For example, if the Executive receives a payment equal to 15 months of severance pay, but is rehired after 12 months, the Executive must reimburse the Company for 3 months of severance pay.
 
To the extent applicable, any severance benefits that an Executive receives pursuant to Section III above shall be considered "Paid Leave in Lieu of Notice" in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C.  2101 et seq.) and any similar state worker protection law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, an Executive shall not be required to execute a Release to receive severance benefits pursuant to Section III above to the extent such benefits constitute "Paid Leave in Lieu of Notice" under WARN or any applicable state worker protection law.
 
The O&CC shall be responsible for the general administration and management of the Plan (the "Plan Administrator"). The O&CC shall be the sole named fiduciary with respect to the Plan and shall have absolute discretion in the control, interpretation and administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, determining eligibility for benefits under the Plan and determining whether a domestic relations order satisfies the requirements set forth in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B). The Plan Administrator's decisions shall be final and bind all parties. The O&CC may delegate any administrative responsibility it may have under the Plan to one or more individuals, including individuals who are employees of the Company.
 
The Company shall pay the benefits of the Plan out of its general assets. Therefore, there is no separate fund of assets maintained in connection with the Plan. The Company shall make severance payments under the Plan directly to an Executive.
 
The Company may amend or terminate the Plan at any time with a written document, which may be integrated into the text of this or other documents of the Plan or may be a freestanding document. An amendment may prospectively reduce or eliminate any benefit provided by the Plan. The authority to amend the Plan is vested in the O&CC or its delegate.
 
 
The Plan is intended to be an unfunded "top-hat" welfare plan within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation Section 2520.104-24, and shall be interpreted, administered, and enforced in accordance with ERISA. It is expressly intended that ERISA preempt the application of state laws to the Plan, to the maximum extent permitted by Section 514 of ERISA. To the extent that state law is applicable, the statutes and common laws of the State of California (excluding its choice of laws principles) shall apply.
 
A.          Any person claiming a benefit under the Plan shall present such a claim in writing to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall respond to the claim within 90 days unless special circumstances require an extension of time of up to an additional 90 days. Prior to the expiration of the initial 90-day period, the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant of any such special circumstances and the date by which a decision is expected.
B.          If the claim is denied, the Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant with a written notice that sets forth (i) the specific reason or reasons for the denial, (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the denial is based, (iii) a description of any additional materials or information necessary for the claimant to perfect his or her claim and an explanation of why such materials or information is necessary and (iv) a description of the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.
C.          A claimant may request review of a denied claim by providing written notice to the Plan Administrator within 60 days of the date of denial. In connection with the request for review, the claimant may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim for benefits. The claimant shall also be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant's claim for benefits. The Plan Administrator shall decide whether to affirm or reverse the earlier denial of benefits taking into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the claimant relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefits determination.
D.          The Plan Administrator's decision on review shall be made within 60 days, unless the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time of up to an additional 60 days. Prior to the expiration of the initial 60-day period, the Plan Administrator shall notify the claimant of any such special circumstances and the date by which a decision is expected. The Plan Administrator shall provide the claimant with written notice of its benefit determination on review. In the event of an adverse claim decision, the notice shall include (i) the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination, (ii) reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the benefit determination is based, (iii) a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant's claim for benefits and (iv) a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under ERISA.
 
E.          The procedure set forth in this Section IX is intended to comply with Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1 and is intended to be construed in accordance with such regulation. All decisions on review shall be final and bind all parties concerned.
 
Subject to an Executive's exhaustion of the administrative remedies under Section IX above with respect to any claim for benefits under the Plan, any controversy or dispute between the parties involving the construction, interpretation, application or performance of the terms of the Plan or in any way arising under the Plan shall be settled by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the Executive's Release.
 
Nothing in the Plan shall affect the Company's policy concerning "at will" employment. Executives are "at will" employees and may be terminated at any time, with or without Cause.
 
Except as otherwise provided in Sections IV.A. or B. above or as provided in a domestic relations order as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B), the rights, interests and benefits of an Executive hereunder (i) may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, gifted, bequeathed or otherwise disposed of to any other party by such Executive or any beneficiary, executor, administrator, heir, distributee or other person claiming under such Executive and (ii) shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation, gift, bequest or other disposition of such rights, interests or benefits contrary to the foregoing provisions of this Section XII shall be null and void and without effect.
 
Any notice or communication required or permitted to be given under this Plan shall be delivered personally or via an overnight courier service or be sent by United States registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, and addressed or delivered as follows: (i) any notice to a Participant shall be delivered to the Participant's most recent address on file with the Company and (ii) any notice to the Company shall be delivered to the Administrator at the following address: General Counsel, Allergan, Inc., 2525 Dupont Drive, Irvine, California 92612, or to such other address as either the Company or the Participant shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith.
 
Regardless of any action the Company or an affiliate takes with respect to any or all income tax, employment tax, or other tax-related items related to Executive's participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Executive ("Tax-Related Items"), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains Executive's responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or an affiliate. The Company and/or the affiliate (1) make no
 
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items with respect to the Plan; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of any payment under the Policy to reduce or eliminate Executive's liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Executive is subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Company and/or an affiliate (which may be a former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. Finally, all payment amounts are subject to
-
tax withholding to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.
 
A.          The Company intends that any payments, benefits or reimbursements that an Executive may become entitled to receive under the Plan be exempt from or comply with Section 409A. The provisions of this Section XIII shall qualify and supersede all other provisions of the Plan as necessary to fulfill the foregoing intention. If the Company believes, at any time, that any such payment, benefit or reimbursement is not exempt or does not so comply, the Company shall promptly advise the Executive and shall reasonably and in good faith take such actions (with the most limited possible economic effect on the Executive and on the Company) as may be necessary for the payment, benefit or reimbursement to be exempt from or comply with Section 409A or to minimize any additional tax, interest and/or penalties that may apply under Section 409A if exemption or compliance is not practicable.
B.          If an Executive is a "specified employee" (determined by the Company in accordance with Section 409A) as of the date that the Executive incurs an Involuntary Termination, and if any payment, benefit or reimbursement to be paid or provided under the Plan both (i) constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation") and (ii) cannot be paid or provided in a manner otherwise provided herein without subjecting the Executive to additional tax, interest and/or penalties under Section 409A, then any such payment, benefit or reimbursement that is payable during the first 6 months following the Executive's Involuntary Termination shall be paid or provided to the Executive in a lump-sum cash payment to be made on the earlier of (x) the Executive's death and (y) the first business day of the seventh month immediately following the Executive's Involuntary Termination.
C.          To the extent any in-kind benefit or reimbursement to be paid or provided under the Plan constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit (within the meaning of Section 409A) to an Executive during any calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or provided as in-kind benefits to the Executive in any other calendar year (subject to any lifetime and other annual limits provided under the Company's health plans), (ii) any reimbursements for expenses incurred by the Executive shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, (iii) the Executive shall not be entitled to any in-kind benefits or reimbursement for any expenses incurred subsequent to the end of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive incurs an Involuntary Termination and (iv) the right to any such reimbursement or in-kind benefit may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
 
D.          Any payment, benefit or reimbursement to be paid or provided under section III above due to an Involuntary Termination that is exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v) shall be paid or provided to an Executive only to the extent that such payment or benefit is provided, or reimbursable expense is incurred, no later than the last day of the Executive's second taxable year following the Executive's taxable year in which the Executive incurs an Involuntary Termination; provided, further, that the Company shall reimburse any such reimbursable expenses no later than the last day of the third taxable year following the Executive's taxable year in which the Executive incurs an Involuntary Termination.
E.          The Company's right to reduce any payment of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation to reflect any outstanding debt owed by the applicable Executive to the Company shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(xiii).
F.          In the event that all or a portion of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation that becomes payable to an Executive hereunder is awarded to another individual pursuant to a domestic relations order, the applicable amount may be paid to such individual pursuant to the terms of the domestic relations order in a manner consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii).

(i)      That this paragraph and this Agreement are written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Employee.
(ii)      The waiver and release of claims under the ADEA contained in this Agreement do not cover rights or claims that may arise after the Agreement Date.
(iii)      This Agreement provides for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the Employee is already entitled.

The Employee represents and warrants to the Releasees that there has been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any Claim which the Employee may have against the Releasees by the Employee, or any of them, and the Employee agrees to indemnify and hold the Releasees harmless from any liability, claims, demands, damages, costs, expenses and attorneys' fees incurred as a result of any person asserting any such assignment or transfer of any rights or Claims under any such assignment or transfer from such party.
 
[5.      .
No Suits or Actions
The Employee represents that no claims, actions or charges have been filed against the Releasees by the Employee, and that the Employee is not aware of any facts that would support any Claims or any compliance-related or Code of Ethics violations of any kind whatsoever against the Releasees, including without limitation any Claims for any work-related injuries. If the Employee hereafter commences, joins in, or in any manner seeks relief through any suit arising out of, based upon, or relating to any of the Claims released in this Agreement, or in any manner asserts against the Releasees any of the Claims released in this Agreement, then the Employee agrees to pay to the Releasees against whom such Claim(s) is asserted, in addition to any other damages caused thereby, all attorneys' fees incurred by the Releasees in defending or otherwise responding to the suit or Claim; provided, however, that this provision shall not obligate the Employee to pay the Releasees' attorneys' fees in any action challenging the release of claims under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act or the ADEA, unless otherwise allowed by law.]
[6.      .
Dismissal of Pending Actions; No Other Suits or Actions
Other than (the "Pending Action"), which must be withdrawn and/or dismissed with prejudice as a condition of receiving the Payment and other benefits under this Agreement, the Employee represents that no claims, actions or charges have been filed against the Releasees by the Employee, and that the Employee is not aware of any facts that would support any other claims of any kind whatsoever against the Releasees, including without limitation any Claims for any work-related injuries. The Company will not be required to make the Payment or provide any of the other benefits under this Agreement unless the Company's counsel receives, within 48 days of the Termination Date, an original of a request for withdrawal and/or dismissal with prejudice of the Pending Action in a form acceptable to the Company's counsel signed by the Employee or the Employee's counsel. If the Employee hereafter commences, joins in, or in any manner seeks relief though any suit rising out of, based upon, or relating to any of the Claims released in this Agreement or in any manner asserts against the Releasees any of the Claims released in this Agreement, including by any attempt to reopen, have reconsidered or appeal the dismissal of the Pending Action, then the Employee agrees to pay to the Releasees against whom such Claim(s) is asserted, in addition to any other damages caused thereby, all attorneys' fees incurred by the Releasees in defending or otherwise responding to the suit or Claim; provided, however, that this provision shall not obligate the Employee to pay the Releasees' attorneys' fees in any action challenging the release of claims under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act or the ADEA, unless otherwise allowed by law.]

If any provision of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then such provisions shall be deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent and in the manner necessary to render the same valid and enforceable or shall be deemed excised from this Agreement as such circumstances may require, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law as if such provision had been originally incorporated herein as so modified or restricted or as if such provision had not been originally incorporated herein, as the case may be.

The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the then current JAMS rules governing employment disputes, and shall take place in Orange County, California, which the Employee represents is a convenient location for the Employee. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Parties to this Agreement and any of the Releasees who agrees to arbitration, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. All costs of the arbitration proceeding or litigation to enforce this Agreement, including attorneys' fees and witness expense fees, shall be paid as the arbitrator or court awards in accordance with applicable law. To the extent required by law, the Company will advance fees payable to JAMS. Except for claims for emergency equitable or injunctive relief, which cannot be timely addressed through arbitration, this arbitration procedure is intended to be the exclusive method of resolving any claim relating to the obligations set forth in this Agreement.
The Parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial on any dispute or Claim covered by this Agreement.

Employee's counsel, accountant and/or tax advisor; provided that such counsel, accountant and tax advisor agree that they will also be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, except to the extent necessary to obtain an order enforcing the terms of this Agreement, or as otherwise required by law. The Company will not disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement to anyone other than its counsel, auditors, tax advisors, insurers, or employees with a business need to know; provided that such counsel, auditors, tax advisors, insurers and employees agree that they will also be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, except to the extent necessary to obtain an order enforcing the terms of this Agreement, or as otherwise required by law. The Employee and the Employee's representatives shall make no public announcements or publications, or hold any press conferences concerning this Agreement or any dispute between them or between the Employee or any of the other Releasees.
In the event of any disclosure authorized by this Agreement, the party disclosing the terms shall inform the recipient that the terms of this Agreement are confidential and that they shall not be further disclosed. In the event that disclosure of the terms of this Agreement are sought in any manner by any person who is not a party to this Agreement, the party from whom disclosure is sought will promptly notify the other party that such disclosure has been requested and will cooperate with the other party in opposing the disclosure to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Parties agree that they will not make any statements concerning this Agreement or the status of any dispute between them other than to state that "the matter has been resolved."
