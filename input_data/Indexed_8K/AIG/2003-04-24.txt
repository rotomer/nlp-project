The following information, including the text of the press release attached as an Exhibit to this Form 8-K, is furnished pursuant to Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure" and Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition". On April 24, 2003, American International Group, Inc. (AIG) issued a press release announcing its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.

Throughout the press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful, as well as most transparent.

Moreover, the equity analysts who follow AIG exclude such realized transactions in their analyses for the same reason. Premium income, in some cases, and combined ratios are presented in accordance with principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. A reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles is included in the Financial Highlights table of the press release.

-3- Income before income taxes and minority interest was $2.92 billion in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $2.96 billion in 2002. The following table outlines the results for the first quarter (in millions): FIRST QUARTER 2003 2002 Change ---- ---- ------ General Insurance operating income (1) $1,316.4 $1,055.1 24.8% Life Insurance operating income (2) 1,540.1 1,355.4 13.6 Financial Services operating income 530.5 473.9 11.9 Retirement Savings & Asset Management operating income 282.8 299.7 (5.6) Other Income (Deductions)-net (114.4) 6.4 - Adjusted income before income taxes and minority interest 3,555.4 3,190.5 11.4 Realized capital gains (losses) (3) (631.5) (231.8) - Income before income taxes and minority interest $2,923.9 $2,958.7 (1.2)% (1) General insurance income before income taxes in first quarter 2003 was $1,143.9 million, including $172.5 million of realized capital losses, compared to $933.3 million in first quarter 2002, including realized capital losses of $121.8 million. (2) Life insurance income before income taxes in first quarter 2003 was $1,195.1 million, including $345.0 million of realized capital losses, compared to $1,326.6 million in first quarter 2002, including realized capital losses of $28.8 million. (3) Realized capital gains (losses) include both actual asset sales and impairment provisions, which may be recovered on ultimate disposition depending on future market conditions. The following tables outline the impact of foreign exchange on property-casualty and life insurance premiums for the first quarter 2003: GENERAL INSURANCE NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN ----------------- WORLDWIDE FOREIGN --------- ------- Premium Growth in Original Currency 28.4% 25.0% Foreign Exchange Impact 1.7 5.7 Premium Growth as Reported in U.S. $ 30.1% 30.7% -more-

This differs from the revenue concept for GAAP, which recognizes only risk coverage as premium and excludes deposits and other considerations. Commenting on first quarter results, AIG Chairman M. R. Greenberg said, "AIG had a good first quarter. General Insurance, Life Insurance and Financial Services all had double-digit growth in operating income, excluding realized capital losses. Retirement Savings continues to be impacted by weak global equity markets. "Shareholders' equity at March 31, 2003 was a record $62 billion. Assets were a record high $590 billion and the annualized return on equity for the quarter was a strong 16.9 percent. "First quarter General Insurance operating income grew 24.8 percent to a record $1.32 billion, as a result of strong performance in both the Domestic Brokerage Group and Foreign General operations. Net premiums written were a record $8.24 billion in the first quarter of 2003, up 30.1 percent over a year ago. The General Insurance combined ratio was 93.13 versus 95.76 in last year's first quarter, and the expense ratio was excellent, 18.98 compared to 20.52 a year ago. "In the United States, Domestic Brokerage Group net premiums written in the first quarter of 2003 increased 31.7 percent (approximately 37 percent adjusting for cancelled or nonrenewed business) to a record $4.54 billion. The combined ratio was 94.80, compared to 97.65 in the first quarter of 2002. Although some competitors have been pricing commercial property and smaller commercial casualty lines more aggressively, AIG has maintained strong pricing discipline and is still implementing necessary rate increases for these lines, as well as for major corporate accounts and the specialized classes of business that are a core strength of AIG. The flight to quality continues, given the recent ratings downgrades of several insurers and reinsurers. We are working for tort reform at the federal, state and local levels, with a broad-based coalition of businesses of every size that recognize the enormous costs to the entire U.S. economy of the explosion of litigation and liability claims. -more-
-5- "HSB Group, Inc., the industry leader in providing equipment breakdown insurance and related engineering and loss control services, had another good quarter as it increased unit growth domestically and continued to leverage AIG's global network to expand its presence in international markets. "Domestic Personal Lines had an excellent quarter. Net premiums written were $884.2 million, up 21.8 percent over the prior year. The combined ratio was 96.43 in the first quarter of 2003, compared to 101.08 a year ago. "United Guaranty Corporation had a good quarter with an excellent combined ratio. Its strong increase in new business was largely offset by a decline in renewal premiums, reflecting the continuing high level of refinancings. "Foreign General Insurance had outstanding results in the quarter. Net premiums written were a record $1.93 billion, an increase of 30.7 percent, or 25.0 percent in original currency, over the first quarter of 2002. The combined ratio was 88.90, compared to 91.95 in the first quarter of 2002. These excellent results demonstrate once again the strength of our global franchise and the exceptional quality of the Foreign General management team. Every major region of the worldwide network contributed to this performance, and we expect continued strong results in the foreseeable future. "The General Insurance paid loss ratio declined in the first quarter of 2003 to 58.10, from 72.93 a year ago. We added $1.17 billion to AIG's General Insurance net loss and loss adjustment reserves in the first quarter of 2003, bringing the total of those reserves to $31.52 billion at March 31, 2003. "Total General Insurance cash flow continues to be outstanding. New cash flow for investments from General Insurance operations in the first quarter of 2003 was a record of approximately $3.24 billion, compared to $1.39 billion in the first quarter of 2002. Net investment income from General Insurance grew 5.2 percent. Even though interest rates remain at historic lows, we are beginning to benefit from the substantial net increases in cash flow since the beginning of 2002. "Worldwide Life Insurance operating income was $1.54 billion, compared to $1.36 billion in the first quarter of 2002. Results were strong in most regions. Worldwide Life Insurance premium income, deposits and other considerations were $13.01 billion, an increase of 1.5 percent over the first quarter of 2002. Excluding worldwide guaranteed investment contracts, which vary from quarter to quarter depending on market conditions, premium income, deposits and other considerations increased 18.8 percent compared to the first quarter of 2002. Life insurance cash flow from both foreign and domestic operations continues to be outstanding. "Asia, the largest region of Foreign Life, had good results in terms of both operating income and premium growth. AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. has provided us with an additional distribution platform to serve the life insurance, accident and health and related needs of Japan, the world's second largest life insurance market. AIG Star Life has been receiving benefit in the form of operating income related to surrender charges on -more-
-6- policies that lapsed after it obtained approval to lower policy crediting rates. As expected, most of these excess surrender charges occurred by the end of first quarter of 2003. We expect comparatively lower operating income from AIG Star Life beginning in the second quarter of this year. Going forward, growth at AIG Star Life will be based on new and renewal business, a growing agency force and productivity gains. However, we anticipate AIG Star Life earnings in 2004 will be comparable to its expected 2003 earnings. "Domestic Life operating income was $664.2 million in the first quarter 2003, compared to $632.2 million in first quarter 2002. Premium income, deposits and other considerations were $6.93 billion, compared to $7.27 billion in the first quarter of 2002. Excluding guaranteed investment contracts, life insurance premium income, deposits and other considerations increased 18.1 percent over first quarter of 2002. AIG American General had strong growth from the universal and term life products and structured settlements. American General Life and Accident Insurance Company (AGLA), the home services business, has continued to grow through the introduction of new products and an enhanced agency force. First year AGLA sales of life and accident and health products increased approximately 18 percent in the quarter. "The individual fixed annuity business (reported in the Life Insurance segment), continued to experience strong demand for its guaranteed fixed return products. Premium income, deposits and other considerations increased 22.6 percent in the first quarter to $2.77 billion. AIG Annuity Insurance Company, the largest provider of fixed annuities through banks, also is expanding its distribution through broker-dealers and mutual funds. "We have lowered crediting rates in response to a lower interest rate environment and are giving greater emphasis to protection products such as accident and health coverages, which are less interest rate sensitive. "The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) did not impact our business in the first quarter. Going forward, SARS may impede agents from freely visiting prospects and will likely have some dampening effect on new sales in certain Asian markets in the second quarter. As a result, we have increased our direct marketing efforts including telephone marketing. There is growing demand for some of AIG's traditional policyholder protection and critical illness products. We expect the outbreak of SARS to have only a slight impact on profitability. "Financial Services operating income grew 11.9 percent to $530.5 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $473.9 million in the first quarter of 2002. "International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) reported operating income of $174.3 million in the first quarter of 2003, versus $173.1 million a year ago. We have cancelled or deferred delivery on some new aircraft, which we are able to do under the terms of our contracts with the manufacturers with no financial impact to AIG. At the end of the first quarter, all but one aircraft with leases that have expired or that have been returned to us as a result of airline difficulties have been profitably redeployed. In a difficult commercial aviation environment, ILFC continues to perform well as a result of -more-
-7- its geographically diversified customer base, its modern and efficient fleet and the industry's best management team. "AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP) reported operating income of $195.9 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $176.2 million in the first quarter of 2002. AIGFP's growing earnings are largely derived from providing innovative solutions to the financial requirements of its clients worldwide. "American General Finance had a good quarter, with total originations and renewals increasing 15 percent over last year, as the company continued to expand its real estate loan portfolio. Credit quality remains solid, and in spite of weak economic conditions, the net charge-off and delinquency ratios improved. Our small but growing overseas consumer finance business is performing profitably. "Retirement Savings & Asset Management earned $282.8 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $299.7 million in the same period of 2002. The Group Retirement Savings business, led by AIG VALIC in the United States, is experiencing good growth, but results in the individual variable annuity and mutual fund businesses continue to be impacted by weak equity markets. Fees are also down in the broker-dealer operations. However, the institutional asset management business of AIG Global Investment Group, Inc. performed well in the quarter. "AIG had pretax realized capital losses of $631.5 million in the first quarter of 2003, compared to $231.8 million realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2002. These realized capital losses reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings. The largest portion of these losses is derived from the inclusion of unrealized losses on investments previously written down to market through shareholders' equity. Upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings, a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions. To put these numbers in perspective, first quarter realized capital losses represented 0.1 percent of AIG's total March 31, 2003 cash and invested assets of approximately $460 billion. "In the Other Income/Deductions-net category, AIG reported net losses of $114.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 compared to a net gain of $6.4 million a year earlier. This is primarily attributable to AIG SunAmerica partnership investments, which experienced significantly less income returns in the first quarter of 2003 compared to that recorded a year ago. -more-
-8- "As previously reported, beginning January 1, 2003, AIG expensed stock options pursuant to FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. AIG's incentive plans have always rewarded long-term performance that contributes to shareholder value, and the expensing of stock options has not been an economic issue for AIG. In 2003, we expect the expense to be less than $0.01 per share." # # # # AIG is the world's leading international insurance and financial services organization, with operations in approximately 130 countries and jurisdictions.
