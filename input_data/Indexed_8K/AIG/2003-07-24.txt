-3- Income before income taxes and minority interest in the second quarter of 2003 increased 23.9 percent. Following is a summary table of second quarter and six months information (in millions): The following table outlines the impact of foreign exchange on property-casualty net premiums written and life insurance GAAP premiums for the second quarter 2003: Commenting on second quarter results, AIG Chairman M.R. Greenberg said, "AIG had a very good quarter. General Insurance, Life Insurance and Financial Services all had record results. Retirement Savings & Asset Management had improved performance as equity markets made gains. "In June, we announced an agreement to buy from General Electric its life insurance operations in Japan and auto and home insurance business in the U.S. These acquisitions will enhance our position in attractive markets and businesses where AIG has proven capabilities. "Over the second quarter, assets and shareholders' equity both rose to record levels. At June 30, 2003, assets approximated $620 billion and shareholders' equity exceeded $68 billion. "GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATING INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 INCREASED 29.4 PERCENT OVER A YEAR AGO TO $1.21 BILLION INCLUDING REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES OF $83.5 MILLION. We had excellent results in both the Domestic Brokerage Group and Foreign General operations. Net premiums written were a record $8.84 billion, up 30.4 percent over a year ago. The General Insurance combined ratio was a strong 92.27 versus 94.09 a year ago. The General Insurance expense ratio further improved to 18.44 from 20.03 a year ago. -more-
-4- "In the United States, Domestic Brokerage Group net premiums written in the second quarter of 2003 increased 37.4 percent over a year ago to a record $5.06 billion. The combined ratio was 94.43 compared to 97.25 in the second quarter of 2002. "Property-casualty rates in the Domestic Brokerage Group continued to rise in the quarter. Rate increases ranged from 30 to 40 percent in most casualty lines, more in certain lines such as directors and officers insurance and excess casualty coverages. Property rates, which had increased significantly over the last few years, were up modestly in the second quarter. During the quarter we introduced new products including comprehensive protection for directors and officers, new coverages against cyber security threats and new aviation coverages. "HSB Group, Inc. (HSB) is achieving excellent results and is working closely with Domestic Brokerage Group and Foreign General operations identifying new opportunities. HSB is the industry leader in providing equipment breakdown insurance and related engineering and loss control services. "Domestic Personal Lines had very good current results in the second quarter. Net premiums written were $900.4 million, up 11.6 percent over the prior year. Rates have continued to firm. The combined ratio was 100.07 or 95.84 excluding 4.23 points associated with 21st Century Insurance Group's $37 million increase in 1994 Northridge earthquake loss reserves for claims reopened by California Senate Bill 1899, as previously reported by 21st Century. The combined ratio was 99.67 in the second quarter of 2002. The pending acquisition of GE's U.S. based automobile insurance units will complement AIG's existing domestic personal automobile insurance business. "United Guaranty Corporation, AIG's mortgage guaranty insurance operation, achieved an excellent combined ratio of 35.80. Reflecting the continuing high level of refinancings, new business was offset by a decline in renewal premiums. "Foreign General Insurance had excellent results from its unrivalled worldwide franchise. Net premiums in the second quarter increased 24.5 percent over the second quarter of 2002, to a record $1.96 billion. The combined ratio was an outstanding 86.53 compared to 88.39, a year ago. Southeast Asia and the U.K. had double digit premium growth. The Japan and European operations continue to benefit from the flight to quality. Economic weakness in many parts of the world has not deterred our growth as a result of our unsurpassed ability to provide strong financial security, a wide range of innovative products and responsive service. "AT TRANSATLANTIC HOLDINGS, INC., A MAJORITY-OWNED AIG SUBSIDIARY, NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 ROSE 35.6 PERCENT TO $802.9 MILLION. The combined ratio improved to 96.30 from 98.22. Transatlantic is the largest broker-market reinsurance organization in the United States and a leader in the specialty casualty field. -more-
-5- "General Insurance cash flow continues to be very strong. NEW CASH FLOW FOR INVESTMENTS FROM GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2003 WAS A RECORD $5.91 BILLION, COMPARED TO $2.79 BILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2002. Net cash flow has increased $13.34 billion since the beginning of 2002. Net investment income rose 7.6 percent to $731.5 million in the second quarter of 2003 and 6.3 percent to $1.52 billion for the first six months of 2003. The growth in investment income is a direct reflection of the strong growth in net cash flow and improving results in partnership income. "WE ADDED $1.57 BILLION AND $2.74 BILLION TO AIG'S GENERAL INSURANCE NET LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT RESERVES FOR THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY, bringing the total of those reserves to $33.09 billion at June 30, 2003. "WORLDWIDE LIFE INSURANCE OPERATING INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 WAS $1.56 BILLION, INCLUDING $171.1 MILLION OF REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES, COMPARED TO $1.22 BILLION, INCLUDING $310.7 MILLION OF REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES, A YEAR AGO. GAAP premiums were $5.47 billion, an increase of 6.1 percent over the second quarter of 2002. Total life production, which includes premiums, deposits and other considerations, was $11.58 billion, a decline of 12.8 percent, compared to second quarter 2002. Guaranteed Investment Contracts are an opportunistic business and in the second quarter we reduced our issuances, especially in the domestic market. Worldwide life production, excluding worldwide guaranteed investment contracts and domestic individual fixed annuities, increased 6.4 percent in the second quarter of 2003, compared to the second quarter 2002. Life insurance cash flow from both foreign and domestic operations continues to be outstanding. "Asia, the largest region of Foreign Life, had good operating income and premium growth. While the outbreak of SARS in Asia had a short term impact on first year life insurance policy sales in April and May, conditions have improved dramatically since then. Beijing, Shanghai, Southern China and Hong Kong are virtually back to normal. Conditions in Taiwan and Singapore also are much improved. The SARS epidemic has heightened the awareness of the importance of protection policies, and we have been introducing a series of new products to serve this need. In China, second quarter production, comprised of premiums, deposits and other considerations, rose 28 percent. In the past six months, new business increased 30 percent in China and more than 10 percent in Hong Kong. "In Japan, the world's second largest life insurance market after the United States, we had good results. ALICO, our largest life operation in Japan, had strong performance in terms of premium growth and operating income. When we complete the acquisition of GE Edison Life in Japan, AIG will have the leading foreign life insurance presence in the marketplace and a strong distribution platform for serving the life, annuity, and accident and health insurance needs of this important market. Additionally, our Korean operation performed well this quarter. -more-
-6- "Domestic Life also had good results. AIG American General, which was the most profitable life insurer in the United States in 2002, had good growth through new products and cross selling initiatives. Domestic Life operating income including realized capital losses in the second quarter of 2003 was $594.3 million. AIG American General's transition to a profit center structure has enabled it to respond quickly to new opportunities, such as the recently launched voluntary benefits unit, which will sell payroll deduction life and accident and health products. "The individual fixed annuity business, which is reported in the Life Insurance segment, performed well. We have been lowering annuity crediting rates, so the net interest margin in this business has remained steady or improved even as interest rates remain low. In markets where we were not able to reduce rates and maintain adequate margins we deliberately curtailed sales in the second quarter. That trend is reversing itself in the third quarter and business is off to a very strong start. "FINANCIAL SERVICES had excellent results, achieving solid profits derived from a diversified range of businesses and products. OPERATING INCOME GREW 14.9 PERCENT TO $622.9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, COMPARED TO $542.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002. "International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) reported operating income of $183.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, versus $207.7 million a year ago. Despite the challenging environment, demand for ILFC's modern and efficient fleet continues to be strong. All new and used aircraft deliveries in 2003 have been placed, and 78 percent of 2004 new aircraft deliveries have been leased. While some of the new lease rates for aircraft that have been redeployed are lower, this is largely offset by very low interest rates, which reduce ILFC's financing costs. Air travel in Asia, a major market for ILFC, has increased substantially now that the risk of SARS has dramatically abated. Approximately 88 percent of ILFC's fleet is leased outside of the United States. "AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP) reported operating income of $254.2 million in the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 41.0 percent over the second quarter of 2002. AIGFP's interest rate, currency and credit derivative segments contributed to the strong growth. AIGFP serves customer needs and is not dependent on taking positions on the direction of interest rates and other markets. AIG Trading Group Inc. also had good results, with operating income of $22.6 million compared to $21.0 million in the second quarter of 2002. To take better advantage of the synergies between businesses in the capital markets, we intend to combine AIGFP and AIG Trading into one reporting unit. "Both U.S. and foreign consumer finance businesses had good results in the quarter. Operating income increased 18.4 percent in the second quarter of 2003 to $166.9 million. American General Finance had a good quarter as credit quality continues to be strong. AIG's international consumer finance operations posted good growth. -more-
-7- "RETIREMENT SAVINGS & ASSET MANAGEMENT operating income increased 7.7 percent over a year ago to $301.7 million. The Group Retirement Savings business, led by AIG VALIC in the United States, earned $226.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $219.1 million a year ago. Operating income in the individual variable annuity and mutual fund businesses was $6.6 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $11.4 million in second quarter of 2002 and a loss of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2003. Our institutional asset management operation continues to attract new business. At June 30, 2003, AIG's third party assets under management, including institutional accounts and retail mutual funds, totaled over $43 billion. "AIG had pretax realized capital losses of $356.9 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to $629.5 million in the second quarter of 2002. The largest portion of these losses continues to be derived from the inclusion of unrealized losses on investments previously written down to market through shareholders' equity. Upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings, a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions. "In the Other Income/Deductions-net category, AIG reported net deductions of $164.7 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared to net deductions of $49.7 million a year earlier. Principal components of this category are administrative, interest and pension expenses. "In light of the substantial increase in AIG's shareholders' equity in the second quarter of 2003 and the recent congressional action decreasing the tax rate on corporate dividends paid to shareholders, AIG'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS INCREASED ITS PREVIOUSLY DECLARED DIVIDEND OF 5.2 CENTS PER COMMON SHARE TO BE PAID IN SEPTEMBER 2003 TO 6.5 CENTS PER COMMON SHARE. This is an increase of 25.0 percent over the previously declared dividend and a 38.3 percent increase over the 4.7 cents per common share paid in June 2003." -more-

CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and its past and future filings and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the business environment in which AIG operates and the important factors that may affect its business.

-9- COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release, including the financial highlights and supplementary earnings data, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein. Throughout this press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use AIG's financial information in evaluating the performance of AIG. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net income and operating income, AIG shows both net income and operating income exclusive of realized capital gains (losses). Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income (or loss) and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of both life and general insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In sum, investment income and realized capital gains or losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance. AIG believes that a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, and it evaluates the performance of and manages its operations on that basis. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it much more difficult for users of AIG's financial information to evaluate AIG's success or failure in its basic business, that of insurance underwriting, and may, in AIG's opinion, lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The equity analysts who follow AIG exclude the realized capital transactions in their analyses for the same reason, and consistently request that AIG provide the non-GAAP information. AIG presents life production (premiums, deposits and other considerations), net premiums written and combined ratios in accordance with accounting principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.
