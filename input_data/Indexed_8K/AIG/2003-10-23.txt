- 3 - Income before income taxes and minority interest in the third quarter of 2003 increased 28.4 percent. Following is a summary table of third quarter and nine months information (in millions): The following table outlines the impact of foreign exchange on property-casualty and life insurance premiums for the third quarter 2003: * Guaranteed investment contracts and related products (GICs) are issued when interest rate spreads are advantageous and, therefore, the level of GICs issued in any reporting period may fluctuate substantially. Commenting on third quarter results, AIG Chairman M. R. Greenberg said "AIG had a very good quarter with record General Insurance pretax operating income, strong Life Insurance and Financial Services results and continuing improvement in Retirement Services & Asset Management. "GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 INCREASED 47.4 PERCENT OVER A YEAR AGO TO $1.24 BILLION, INCLUDING REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES OF $74.7 MILLION. Excluding realized capital losses, operating income rose 25.0 percent. Net premiums written were a record $8.97 billion, up 26.5 percent over a year ago. The -more-
- 4 - General Insurance combined ratio was 93.05 (including 0.87 points for catastrophe losses) compared to 94.54 (including 0.65 points for catastrophe losses) a year ago. Benefiting from investments in technology, the General Insurance expense ratio further improved to 19.40 from 20.16 a year ago. Looking ahead, we are reasonably confident that rates in many of the classes of business that AIG specializes in will remain firm for the rest of this year and well into next year. As important as the overall rate environment, risk selection is critical. We pay careful attention to the pricing of specific risks, and there are certain risks we will refuse to write regardless of pricing. For example, in certain states and counties, the legal and tort systems are unfair and distorted and, consequently, we monitor our exposures there extremely carefully. "In the United States, the Domestic Brokerage Group had record net premiums written in the third quarter of 2003 of $5.13 billion, up 31.6 percent over the third quarter of 2002. The combined ratio was 94.78 compared to 96.47 in the third quarter of 2002. Underwriting and cash flow in the Domestic Brokerage Group were both very strong. In some classes of business, such as property and certain middle market coverages, rates have flattened out but at an adequate level. Property rates were not impacted by Hurricane Isabel. "HSB Group, Inc. had another excellent quarter. Underwriting results were strong even after the impact of claims resulting from the August power outages and Hurricane Isabel. "Domestic Personal Lines had a good quarter, with a combined ratio of 97.20 compared to 105.22 in the third quarter 2002. Net premiums written were $919.2 million, compared to $835.5 million a year ago. In the third quarter, we closed on our purchase of GE's personal lines business, which will enhance our market penetration and provide additional claims management and service capabilities. "United Guaranty Corporation, AIG's mortgage guaranty insurance operation, had another good quarter. The combined ratio was 57.58. Premium volume was impacted by a high level of refinancings, which, going forward, should diminish as a result of the upward movement of interest rates. "Our Foreign General operations had excellent results in all regions. Net premiums written in the third quarter of 2003 were $1.87 billion, up 17.3 percent in original currency and 22.0 percent in U.S. dollars. The combined ratio was an outstanding 88.31. "Operating results were excellent in Japan, with rates of growth significantly stronger than the overall industry. Southeast Asia had double-digit premium growth in original currency as well as in U.S. dollars. The U.K. and Europe had excellent growth as a result of both rate increases and new business. The flight to quality has accelerated in Europe, especially in the commercial market. While competition has increased in the energy sector, rates continue to be adequate. -more-
- 5 - "Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., a majority-owned AIG subsidiary, had net premiums written in the third quarter of 2003 of $901.3 million, up 31.1 percent. The combined ratio in the third quarter of 2003 was 96.16 compared to 98.03 a year ago. "NEW CASH FLOW FOR INVESTMENT FROM GENERAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER WAS A RECORD $3.58 BILLION COMPARED TO $2.50 BILLION LAST YEAR. FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 CASH FLOW WAS A RECORD $9.49 BILLION, COMPARED TO $5.29 BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002. "WE ADDED $2.00 BILLION AND $4.74 BILLION TO AIG'S GENERAL INSURANCE NET LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT RESERVES FOR THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY, bringing the total of those reserves to $35.09 billion at September 30, 2003. This includes $415 million in reserves related to the GE personal lines business acquired in the third quarter. "WORLDWIDE LIFE INSURANCE OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 WAS $1.44 BILLION, INCLUDING $259.7 MILLION IN REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES, COMPARED TO $1.25 BILLION, INCLUDING $261.8 MILLION IN REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES, A YEAR AGO. Operating income excluding realized capital losses increased 12.4 percent. GAAP premiums were $5.43 billion, an increase of 6.7 percent over the third quarter of 2002. Excluding GICs, GAAP premiums increased 7.1 percent over third quarter of 2002. Premiums, deposits and other considerations rose 9.5 percent in the third quarter or 16.6 percent excluding GICs. "In the foreign life business, our acquisition of GE Edison in Japan, which is now doing business as AIG Edison, was completed in August. Results from this acquisition will be consolidated in fourth quarter Life Insurance results. Integration plans are moving ahead. "We are providing new information in the supplementary earnings data on first year foreign life premiums as well as certain growth metrics for domestic life. Overall, first year premiums were strong in our foreign life operations in the third quarter, up 23.4 percent over third quarter 2002. "Our life business in China continues to grow rapidly. We achieved 38 percent premium growth in the third quarter of 2003 compared to a year ago. Elsewhere in Asia the life business also was very satisfactory. "The Domestic Life Insurance business, principally AIG American General, had solid top and bottom line growth. Domestic Life operating income in the third quarter of 2003 was $470.4 million, including realized capital losses of $260.0 million. Excluding realized capital losses and guaranteed investment contracts, operating income increased 12.0 percent in the quarter. AIG's profit center structure has taken hold very well at AIG American General. Two new profit centers have been launched to serve the middle income and voluntary employee benefits markets, further expanding our unrivaled distribution platform. -more-
- 6 - "Universal life and term life products had record quarterly sales. Structured settlements had good growth, benefiting from cross marketing efforts. "The home services business that serves the moderate and middle income markets continues to have very strong cash flow; premiums, deposits and other considerations increased by 22.1 percent in the third quarter. This business is in transition to become a multi-product distribution channel targeting this underserved market. Our goal is to achieve double digit income growth by introducing new products including critical illness, cancer, and accidental death and dismemberment policies as well as fixed annuities. We are recruiting new agents and training our agency force to market these products. In addition, we are expanding into new states. "The fixed annuity business primarily sold through the bank distribution channel by AIG Annuity Insurance Company had excellent results -- strong top-line growth and strong bottom-line growth as a result of the widening of interest rate spreads. "FINANCIAL SERVICES HAD GOOD RESULTS ACROSS ITS OPERATIONS. OPERATING INCOME GREW 10.1 PERCENT TO $608.3 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, COMPARED TO $552.5 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002. "During the quarter, we combined the operations of AIG Trading Group Inc. and AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP) into a Capital Markets reporting unit. This combination is resulting in significantly greater efficiencies and product synergies in areas including energy, commodities and foreign exchange. Capital Markets reported operating income of $240.6 million in the third quarter of 2003, an increase of 17.7 percent over the third quarter 2002. AIGFP's interest rate, currency and credit derivative segments again contributed to this strong growth. "International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) reported operating income of $190.5 million in the third quarter of 2003, versus $207.3 million a year ago. Third quarter results were impacted by the concessions made on some leases renegotiated during the year. However, ILFC will benefit from the improving business climate in the airline industry. At the end of the third quarter, all aircraft were leased, including all new aircraft to be delivered in 2003 and 2004. Subsequent to the close of the third quarter, two small European carriers that are customers of ILFC filed for bankruptcy. However, we are reasonably confident an agreement will be reached with the carriers, or the aircraft will be redeployed elsewhere as we have done in the past. At the conclusion of the third quarter, ILFC entered into a securitization of a portfolio of 28 aircraft. Certain of our life insurance and retirement services businesses purchased a large share of this securitization. These businesses will achieve attractive investment income returns from an asset class managed by the industry's premier aircraft lessor, while ILFC benefits from a further diversification of its funding base. "Both U.S. and foreign consumer finance business had a very good quarter. Operating income is up 20.5 percent to $173.6 million. American General Finance, Inc. (AGF) had an outstanding quarter. The quality of the loan portfolio is good and demand is strong. AGF is opening new branches. This business is achieving an excellent return on -more-
- 7 - equity. Our international consumer finance business also is achieving good results. Performance was substantially better in Hong Kong, in line with the up-tick in Hong Kong's economy. "RETIREMENT SERVICES & ASSET MANAGEMENT had a much improved quarter, as a result of the upturn in the stock market and greater optimism for the economic outlook. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 45.7 PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER TO $332.5 MILLION. The Group Retirement Services business, led by AIG VALIC in the United States, earned $230.3 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $161.0 million a year ago. Operating income in the individual variable annuity, mutual fund and broker-dealer businesses was $17.7 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared to $7.0 million in third quarter of 2002. The institutional asset management business continues to increase the amount of assets it manages for third parties. At September 30, 2003, AIG's third party assets under management, including institutional accounts and retail mutual funds, totaled over $45 billion. "AIG had pretax realized capital losses of $359.3 million in the third quarter of 2003, compared to losses of $595.6 million in the third quarter of 2002. "AIG has a large number of promising growth initiatives underway around the world. In addition to the purchase of GE's Japan life and U.S. personal auto insurance businesses, AIG has entered into cooperative agreements in Russia to identify investment opportunities, improve homeowners insurance and provide financing alternatives for Russian home buyers. We also entered into a cooperative agreement with the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) that will enable AIG to market its accident and health products through the PICC's 4,300 branch offices. We will provide training to PICC's agents and expect to sell an extended portfolio of products that we do not currently distribute through our life branches or property-casualty operations in China. We have a long-term relationship with the PICC, which has over 70 percent of the non-life market in China. These initiatives, combined with strong growth in our established businesses and accelerated cross-selling of products and services to our customers around the world, will contribute to our future success." -more-

CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 and its past and future filings and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the business environment in which AIG operates and the important factors that may affect its business.

- 9 - COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release, including the financial highlights and supplementary earnings data, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein. Throughout this press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use AIG's financial information in evaluating the performance of AIG. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net income and operating income, AIG shows both net income and operating income exclusive of realized capital gains (losses). Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income (or loss) and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of both life and general insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In sum, investment income and realized capital gains or losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance. AIG believes that a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, and it evaluates the performance of and manages its operations on that basis. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it much more difficult for users of AIG's financial information to evaluate AIG's success or failure in its basic business, that of insurance underwriting, and may, in AIG's opinion, lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The equity analysts who follow AIG exclude the realized capital transactions in their analyses for the same reason, and consistently request that AIG provide the non-GAAP information. AIG presents life production (premiums, deposits and other considerations), net premiums written and combined ratios in accordance with accounting principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.
