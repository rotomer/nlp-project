-5- Commenting on full-year and fourth quarter 2003 performance, AIG Chairman M. R. Greenberg said, "AIG had record results in 2003, with $10.22 billion in net income, excluding realized capital losses and the cumulative effect of an accounting change. "In addition to record net income of $9.27 billion, AIG had record results in 2003 in all four of our core businesses -- General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services and Retirement Services & Asset Management -- and in most other key measures including shareholders' equity, return on equity, revenues, assets and cash flow. In the fourth quarter of 2003, AIG had net income of $2.71 billion, another record, which gives AIG strong momentum for 2004 and beyond. "In addition to achieving these financial results, AIG in 2003 made important investments that will further AIG's continued growth and success, including the acquisition of GE Edison in Japan, and our investment in, and agreement to market accident and health products with, the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC). GENERAL INSURANCE "AIG's General Insurance business had an excellent year and quarter. Net premiums written were a record $9.16 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003, up 27.0 percent over a year ago. Our top ratings and financial strength have never been more valuable to customers and set us apart from the competition in the U.S. and around the world. Corporate leaders recognize that buying specialty casualty and liability lines, known as `long tail' lines, from other than the most financially strong carriers is taking a credit risk they can ill afford in today's environment. "In the United States, the DOMESTIC BROKERAGE GROUP had very strong growth in 2003. In the fourth quarter, net premiums written were a record $5.33 billion, up 27.3 percent over the same period in 2002. The fourth quarter combined ratio was an excellent 93.53, and the expense ratio was 15.05, far superior to the industry average. The Domestic Brokerage Group has the most extensive array of product offerings in the industry, and it has been successfully expanding its distribution. These initiatives include targeting regional brokers and small- and mid-cap companies. We are the market of choice and the number one provider for all of the major insurance brokers, which attest to our market knowledge, underwriting skill, ability to create new products to meet customer needs, expert claims management and outstanding service. "The success of the Domestic Brokerage Group over the year and fourth quarter of 2003 was very broad-based. Lexington, our excess and surplus lines company, had outstanding results. We are one of the leading providers of terrorism coverage to the aviation industry and other sectors of the economy, and achieved good results from this business over the year and quarter. "HSB Group Inc. achieved record net premiums written in 2003, and has successfully leveraged its engineering and product innovation skills throughout the AIG global network to expand distribution and cross selling and develop new products. -more-
-6- "The Domestic Personal Lines businesses achieved significant premium growth and a strong improvement in profitably in the fourth quarter and full year of 2003. Net premiums written increased 23.2 percent, to $1.00 billion, in the fourth quarter, and the combined ratio was 96.03. The direct marketing, agency auto, assigned risk, 21st Century and Private Client businesses all contributed to the 58.5 percent increase in 2003 pretax operating income. "United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) also did well in the year and quarter. Despite a more challenging mortgage market, UGC earned $87.4 million in pretax operating income in the fourth quarter of 2003 and continued to have a significantly lower delinquency ratio than the mortgage guaranty insurance industry overall. In terms of premiums, new business offset the impact of continued refinancing activities. "Transatlantic Holdings Inc. had an excellent year and quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2003, net premiums written increased 32.2 percent, to $868.9 million. The combined ratio was 96.03. "In 2004, we would expect General Insurance in the United States to have another solid year. While there is more competition for certain `short tail' lines, the market for `long tail' and specialty lines, where AIG has significant competitive strengths, should continue to be strong. "FOREIGN GENERAL INSURANCE had excellent 2003 and fourth quarter performance throughout the world. In the fourth quarter of 2003, net premiums written were $1.82 billion, an increase of 27.1 percent over the same period last year. Growth in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom was very strong, in large part because many local insurers have been beset by capital adequacy problems and could not meet their clients' needs. The Latin America division also performed well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2003. "Asia had strong performance in 2003, including the fourth quarter, and is making significant investments for the future. In October, AIG entered into an agreement with the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), the largest non-life insurance company in China. Under this agreement, AIG companies will market accident and health products through PICC's 4,300 branch offices throughout the country. In conjunction with this cooperative relationship, AIG has made a long-term investment in PICC, purchasing 9.9 percent of the company's share capital. "In Japan, both AIU and American Home, which is the leading direct marketer of general insurance products in the country, had solid results for the year and fourth quarter. Korea also had a good year with record gross premiums. "Foreign General pricing was excellent throughout 2003, and we do not foresee any material change in 2004. -more-
-7- "Reflecting strong cash flow and improved market conditions, General Insurance net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $764.4 million, an increase of 13.5 percent compared to $673.2 million a year ago. For the full year 2003, General Insurance net investment income was $3.02 billion, an increase of 9.5 percent compared to $2.76 billion in 2002. "At year-end 2003, General Insurance net loss and loss adjustment reserves totaled $36.65 billion, an increase of $5.91 billion and $1.56 billion for the full year and the fourth quarter, respectively. LIFE INSURANCE "Both the foreign and domestic Life Insurance operations had record 2003 results and a strong fourth quarter. Worldwide Life Insurance pretax operating income was $1.80 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003, including $50.1 million in realized capital losses, compared to $1.13 billion a year ago, which included $451.8 million in realized capital losses. Excluding realized capital losses, pretax operating income increased 17.0 percent in fourth quarter 2003. "Worldwide Life Insurance GAAP premiums were $6.32 billion, an increase of 19.4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2002. Premiums, deposits and other considerations excluding Guaranteed Investment Contracts and related products (GICs) rose 28.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Premiums, deposits and other considerations for the GIC business increased 84.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003. We write GICs on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable, as they were in the domestic market in the fourth quarter. "AIG's FOREIGN LIFE INSURANCE operations had excellent results in the fourth quarter and full year of 2003, led by Japan, the largest life insurance market in the world outside of the U.S., and AIG's largest Foreign Life Insurance operation. "In its first full quarter as an AIG company, AIG Edison Life Insurance Company had good results. Integrating AIG Edison Life with ALICO Japan and AIG Star Life will provide further efficiencies to the business in 2004 and beyond. We also have been putting into place additional business retention programs for AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life, and new product and distribution initiatives for all three operations. AIG's financial strength, creative product development skills, new business initiatives such as annuities sold through the bank channel, and an improving economic climate give us tremendous optimism for the Life Insurance business in Japan. "The other Asian Life Insurance operations, including Korea and Taiwan, also had a good year and fourth quarter. In China, we are growing rapidly. The number of active agents increased significantly to about 19,000 and total first year premiums increased 43.4 percent during 2003. Throughout Asia, growth was achieved through new product introductions and expanded distribution. In two of the region's most attractive emerging markets, Vietnam and India, we opened new offices and increased the agency forces. -more-
-8- "DOMESTIC LIFE INSURANCE pretax operating income in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $717.2 million, including realized capital losses of $97.5 million, compared to $276.0 million, including realized capital losses of $412.5 million, in the fourth quarter of 2002. "AIG American General had a very good year overall, achieving strong growth from the universal life and term life products and from its affluent and brokerage market segments. AGLA, the home services business, made progress in 2003, launching new products and laying a solid foundation for future growth. The multiple distribution channels of AIG American General are a distinctive source of strength that will fuel growth going forward. "Fixed annuities, which are sold primarily through banks by AIG Annuity Insurance Company, had record sales and pretax operating income in 2003, and an excellent fourth quarter. AIG Annuity added several new banks and financial institutions to its distribution network and moved quickly to reduce crediting rates on its products when interest rates declined during the year. FINANCIAL SERVICES "FINANCIAL SERVICES had record pretax operating income in 2003. In the fourth quarter, pretax operating income was $702.5 million, compared to $620.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. ILFC has been outperforming its competitors in a difficult aviation environment, reflecting its strong management and the geographic diversification of its fleet of modern and efficient aircraft. As a result of a lag effect between changes in market conditions and their impact on results, the improvement in the airline industry has yet to be reflected in ILFC's financial performance. "Capital Markets, created by the integration of AIG Trading into AIG Financial Products Corp., had outstanding results. The consolidation of these operations is moving along as expected, taking out duplicative expenses and providing numerous synergies. In the consumer finance business, American General Finance had a terrific year and quarter, with excellent credit quality. The international consumer finance operations had sharp gains in every major market. RETIREMENT SERVICES & ASSET MANAGEMENT "RETIREMENT SERVICES & ASSET MANAGEMENT had record 2003 pretax operating income of $1.27 billion and record fourth quarter 2003 pretax operating income of $354.3 million, as financial markets and the U.S. economy made gains. AIG VALIC had an outstanding fourth quarter, and the individual variable annuity, broker-dealer, mutual fund and institutional asset management businesses also recorded strong gains in the fourth quarter. Third party institutional and retail mutual fund assets under management increased to more than $46 billion in 2003. -more-
-9- "AIG had pretax net realized capital losses of $85.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 including $117 million of losses from holdings in Parmalat, compared to pretax net realized capital losses of $984.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. OUTLOOK "Moving forward, the outlook for AIG is very positive. We will build on the momentum of 2003's excellent earnings and the good operating environment before us. With its strong balance sheet, AIG's financial security has never been more important to customers around the world. In an increasingly uncertain world, AIG's product innovation and claims expertise have never been more valuable for managing and controlling customers' risks. Under improving global economic conditions, AIG's global network has never been better situated to profit from developing opportunities throughout the world. AIG is poised to achieve continued strong growth." # # # # AIG is the world's leading international insurance and financial services organization, with operations in approximately 130 countries and jurisdictions.

-10 CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and its past and future filings and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the business environment in which AIG operates and the important factors that may affect its business. AIG is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release, including the financial highlights and supplementary earnings data, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein. Throughout this press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use AIG's financial information in evaluating the performance of AIG. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net income and operating income, AIG shows both net income and operating income exclusive of realized capital gains (losses). Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income (or loss) and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of both life and general insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In sum, investment income and realized capital gains or losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance. AIG believes that a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, and it evaluates the performance of and manages its operations on that basis. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it much more difficult for users of AIG's financial information to evaluate AIG's success or failure in its basic business, that of insurance underwriting, and may, in AIG's opinion, lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The equity analysts who follow AIG exclude the realized capital gains and losses in their analyses for the same reason, and consistently request that AIG provide the non-GAAP information. -more-
-11- AIG presents life production (premiums, deposits and other considerations), net premiums written and combined ratios in accordance with accounting principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.
