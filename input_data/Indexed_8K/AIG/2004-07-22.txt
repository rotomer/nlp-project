(d) 2003 is restated to conform to 2004 presentation. Commenting on second quarter results, AIG Chairman M. R. Greenberg said, "AIG had a very good quarter overall, with especially strong results from Worldwide General Insurance operations and Foreign Life & Retirement Services. Second quarter net income was a record $2.86 billion, up 25.7 percent over the second quarter of 2003. Excluding realized capital gains and losses, net income increased 19.2 percent to $3.00 billion. Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2004 was $73.6 billion, and assets increased to a record $736 billion. GENERAL INSURANCE "General Insurance results were very strong both in the U.S. and worldwide. General Insurance operating income excluding realized capital gains (losses) in the second quarter of 2004 increased 22.8 percent over a year ago to a record $1.59 billion. Net premiums written were a record $10.38 billion, up 17.4 percent over a year ago. The General Insurance combined ratio was 92.35 compared to 92.27 a year ago. "Worldwide General Insurance net investment income was $892.7 million, an increase of 22.0 percent benefiting from strong cash flow resulting from good growth in our business, higher interest rates, dividend income and good private equity results. General Insurance cash flow totaled $3.17 billion and $6.71 billion in the second quarter and six months of 2004, respectively, compared to $2.67 billion and $5.91 billion a year earlier. -more-
-5- "At June 30, 2004, General Insurance net loss and loss adjustment reserves totaled $40.78 billion, an increase of $2.03 billion and $4.13 billion for the second quarter and six months, respectively. "In the United States, the Domestic Brokerage Group had a very good quarter. Net premiums written in the second quarter of 2004 increased 14.8 percent over a year ago to a record $5.81 billion. The combined ratio was 95.00 compared to 94.43 in the second quarter of 2003. The Domestic Brokerage Group is benefiting from the flight to quality - since a Triple A balance sheet is important for many classes of long tail business - a strong profit center focus and vast and growing distribution channels. "We have maintained a disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection. Where pricing, terms and conditions or loss experience did not meet our standards, we chose to non-renew approximately $275 million in premiums in the Domestic Brokerage Group as well as nearly $50 million in our Foreign General operations in the second quarter. While the market generally has taken a rational approach to pricing, a few foreign and domestic companies have under-priced certain more difficult classes of long tail lines of business. These companies often lack the specialized knowledge, underwriting skills and claim management expertise that these lines require. Such pricing practices unsettle the market and add to long term volatility. "Reforming the U.S. tort system is more than an insurance industry issue. It is critical to the economy and the country. Necessary class action reforms had significant support in Congress, and it is unfortunate that debate over the number of non-germane amendments attached to the bill led to what we hope is a temporary setback. Efforts are underway to reconcile these differences, and the bill could be reintroduced at a later date. We will continue to work for its passage. "The Domestic Personal Lines business had good premium growth and solid underwriting performance in the second quarter. Operating income was $91.7 million in the second quarter compared to $28.8 million a year ago. Net premiums written were $1.08 billion, up 20.4 percent over a year ago. The combined ratio was 95.68. "HSB Group, Inc. had outstanding underwriting results. Losses have declined as a result of HSB's leading engineering, inspection and loss mitigation capabilities. The recent integration of AIG Consultants into HSB enhances our cross-sell opportunities and our capabilities for providing engineering and loss control services to a global client base. "United Guaranty Corporation had a good quarter. Premiums grew and refinancings declined as interest rates rose. UGC's delinquency ratio, always well below the industry average, was up modestly over a year ago, but has been declining over the past two quarters consistent with the improving job market. UGC's foreign operations, which we have been nurturing, are profitable, and we are planning to enter several new markets around the world. -more-
-6- "Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. had good growth and underwriting results. Net premiums written increased 15.5 percent to $927.2 million led by significant growth in international business. Operating income was up 15.7 percent to $111.6 million. The combined ratio was 95.69 compared to 96.30 in the second quarter of 2003. "Foreign General Insurance had excellent results from all regions of the world. Net premiums written were $2.42 billion, an increase of 23.8 percent over the second quarter of 2003. The combined ratio continues to be outstanding at 86.24, compared to 86.53 a year ago. "In Japan, the improving economy has contributed to our growth, especially in the growing commercial lines business and personal accident operations. The U. K., European and Australasian regions had excellent results. Latin America has had another good quarter, too. "In China, our landmark venture with PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited to develop the market for accident and health products is up and running. Also, we expect, by the end of 2004, to extend our general insurance operations to more cities in China as the market opens up in compliance with WTO rules. LIFE INSURANCE & RETIREMENT SERVICES "Worldwide Life Insurance & Retirement Services had excellent top and bottom line growth. Operating income before realized capital gains (losses) was a record $2.17 billion, an increase of 18.2 percent, compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2003. Worldwide Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums were $6.84 billion, an increase of 21.6 percent over the second quarter of 2003. Premiums, deposits and other considerations totaled $16.28 billion, up 40.2 percent compared to the second quarter of 2003. Cash flow continues to be outstanding. "AIG's extensive Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations had excellent results. Operating income excluding realized capital gains (losses) was $1.22 billion in the second quarter compared to $990.2 million a year ago. GAAP premiums were $5.28 billion, up 24.0 percent. Premiums, deposits and other considerations were $8.99 billion, compared to $5.74 billion in the second quarter of 2003. Japan and Southeast Asia, our two largest regions, had strong growth. "In Japan, AIG Edison Life is being integrated successfully into our life operations. AIG Star is growing first year premiums as a result of new product introductions and an expanded agency force, and is benefiting from more successful conservation of in-force business. The annuity business in Japan is growing rapidly through product innovation and packaging skills and the confidence engendered by the financial strength of AIG companies. In addition, our deep and diverse distribution, which includes bancassurance, worksite marketing, direct marketing and strong agency organizations, provides us with a powerful platform for growth. -more-
-7- "In China, our life insurance business continues to grow very rapidly. Total first year premiums were up 43.4 percent in the second quarter over the prior year. By comparison, the overall industry has experienced modest growth, with some companies showing decreases in first year premiums. The skill and training of our agency force, financial strength and excellent management are the primary contributors to our success. "In India, the new government has proposed to Parliament legislation that would allow foreign companies to increase their ownership in life as well as general insurance companies to 49 percent from the current 26 percent. Passage of this legislation would present a significant opportunity for us to enhance our presence in this attractive market, where our life and general insurance joint ventures have had rapid growth throughout the country. "Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income excluding realized capital gains (losses) totaled $953.5 million in the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 12.4 percent compared to $848.1 million in the second quarter of 2003. GAAP premiums were $1.56 billion, up 14.2 percent. Premiums, deposits and other considerations were $7.29 billion, a 24.1 percent increase compared to $5.87 billion in the second quarter of 2003. "AIG's domestic life operations had strong universal and term life sales and good performance from the independent distribution segment. Structured settlements also had strong growth. The group business domestically fell below our growth standards. We chose not to renew several accounts where pricing was unacceptable and we are reviewing our growth strategies for this business. At AGLA, the home services business, a number of the initiatives we have taken in recent months to accelerate growth, such as introducing new products, hiring new agents and retraining existing agents, will take some time before the results are evident. However, the business is solidly profitable with strong cash flow. "Domestic Retirement Services had a solid quarter. The businesses most correlated to the equity markets performed well, with the strongest sales growth in the individual variable annuity segment. AIG VALIC, the group retirement services business, which has approximately half of client assets in equities, also benefited from improved equity market performance. AIG VALIC has had a successful start cross-selling individual variable annuities, fixed annuities and mutual funds. AIG Annuity, the individual fixed annuity business, had very good performance with increased deposits, stable spreads and growth in operating income, even as consumers shifted assets to equity-based products. -more-
-8- FINANCIAL SERVICES "Financial Services had operating income of $609.2 million in the second quarter of 2004, a decline of 2.2 percent compared to $622.9 million a year ago. "International Lease Finance Corporation reported operating income of $182.6 million in the quarter, compared to $183.6 million in the second quarter of 2003. Excluding the impact of the securitization of approximately $2 billion in aircraft in late 2003 and early 2004, these results would have increased approximately 5 percent from second quarter 2003. ILFC sold five aircraft during the second quarter, and lease rates continue to rise. The turnaround in the global aviation business is increasingly evident. "Capital Markets operating income was $233.6 million, down 15.6 percent compared to a very strong second quarter of 2003. This transaction-oriented business continues to be very profitable. We have a diverse product portfolio, which we continue to expand, and we see opportunity in each of the major regions around the world where we do business. The consolidation of AIG Trading into AIG Financial Products Corp. is delivering expected synergies as clients are recognizing the benefits of working with a platform that can readily deliver multi-disciplined opportunities. "Consumer Finance had excellent results in both domestic and foreign operations. Operating income increased 15.3 percent to $192.3 million. In the United States, credit quality continues to be strong and receivables grew substantially. Foreign consumer finance operations performed very well and we see new opportunities in several additional international markets. ASSET MANAGEMENT "Asset Management operating income increased 41.4 percent in the second quarter of 2004 to $276.5 million. Improved equity markets and a strong and diverse global product portfolio contributed to these results as well as a $1 billion increase in assets under management, bringing the total to over $49 billion. In July, we received approval to prepare for the establishment of a joint venture fund management company in China. "Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) operating income totaled $178.0 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $139.2 million a year ago. GICs are an opportunistic business, which we write when interest rate spreads are attractive. Market conditions in the second quarter were very favorable. "In the Other Income/Deductions - net category, AIG reported a loss of $51.1 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to a loss of $164.7 million a year earlier. The improvement is primarily attributable to increased income related to SunAmerica partnership investments." -more-

CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 and its past and future filings and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the business environment in which AIG operates and the important factors that may affect its business.

-10- COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release, including the financial highlights and supplementary earnings data, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein. Throughout this press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use AIG's financial information in evaluating the performance of AIG. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net income and operating income, AIG shows both net income and operating income exclusive of realized capital gains (losses). Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income (or loss) and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of both life and general insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In sum, investment income and realized capital gains or losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance. AIG believes that a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, and it evaluates the performance of and manages its operations on that basis. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it much more difficult for users of AIG's financial information to evaluate AIG's success or failure in its basic business, that of insurance underwriting, and may, in AIG's opinion, lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The equity analysts who follow AIG exclude the realized capital gains and losses in their analyses for the same reason, and consistently request that AIG provide the non-GAAP information. AIG presents life and retirement services production (premiums, deposits and other considerations), net premiums written and combined ratios in accordance with accounting principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.
