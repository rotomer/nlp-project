EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS [AIG LOGO] Contact: Charlene Hamrah (Investment Community) (212) 770-7074 Joe Norton (News Media) (212) 770-3144 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. RECEIVES SEC NOTIFICATION NEW YORK, NY, September 21, 2004 - American International Group, Inc. (AIG) announced that AIG and its subsidiary AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP) have been informed by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the Staff is considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil action against AIG and AIGFP alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The Staff's communication, commonly referred to as a "Wells Notice," arises out of the SEC's investigation entitled In the Matter of PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), and involves certain transactions marketed by AIGFP prior to 2003, including three transactions entered into by a subsidiary of AIGFP with PNC between June 2001 and November 2001. The PNC transactions were the subject of an SEC action against PNC in 2002, and were terminated early the next year. AIG and AIGFP believe that the proposed action would be unwarranted and will respond to the Staff. A Wells Notice provides notice that the SEC Staff is considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil action alleging violation of the federal securities laws. Under the SEC procedures, the recipient can avail itself of the opportunity to respond to the SEC Staff before it makes a formal recommendation regarding what action, if any, should be brought against a company by the SEC. # # # American International Group, Inc.
