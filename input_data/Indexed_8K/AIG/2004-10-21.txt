For the third quarter and nine months 2004, operating income includes $116 million and $147 million, respectively, of third-party limited partner earnings offset in Minority Interest Expense. Commenting on AIG's results, AIG Chairman, M.R. Greenberg said, "AIG had third quarter net income of $2.51 billion, up 7.5 percent, even after accounting for the unprecedented succession of storms, which included four hurricanes and three typhoons. Excluding realized capital gains (losses) and catastrophe losses, net income in the third quarter of 2004 increased 16.5 percent over a year ago. For the first nine months of 2004, net income was a record $8.03 billion, up 22.3 percent. Excluding realized capital gains (losses), cumulative effect of an accounting change and catastrophe losses, net income for the first nine months increased 18.5 percent. "This storm season was the most costly in history, and it resulted in a tragic loss of life. AIG's third quarter 2004 after tax catastrophe losses of $512.2 million compare to average annual after tax catastrophe losses over the prior 15 years of approximately $50 million. The importance of AIG's claims handling expertise, strong financial position and diverse business mix is evident in this quarter's results. more-
-6- "For many years, the insurance industry has sought the ability to set up catastrophe reserves specifically to provide for serious events, such as those in the third quarter. The U.S. Congress and Treasury have not supported these efforts. However, I would hope that, following the impact of these destructive storms, more attention will be paid to this matter. GENERAL INSURANCE "General Insurance had a strong quarter in the U.S. and around the world. General Insurance operating income excluding realized capital gains (losses) in the third quarter of 2004 was $894.3 million compared to $1.32 billion a year ago. Excluding catastrophe losses and realized capital gains (losses), General Insurance operating income increased 17.5 percent. Net premiums written were a record $10.73 billion, up 19.7 percent over a year ago. The General Insurance combined ratio was 99.89, or 92.76 excluding catastrophe losses, compared to 93.05, or 92.17 excluding catastrophe losses, a year ago. "Worldwide General Insurance net investment income was $869.0 million, an increase of 17.1 percent. Strong cash flow in our business resulted in increased interest and dividend income. We also had good realizations from our private equity investments compared to the prior year. General Insurance cash flow totaled $3.64 billion and $10.35 billion in the third quarter and nine months of 2004, respectively, compared to $3.58 billion and $9.49 billion a year earlier. "Underwriting is a process of careful risk by risk selection as well as pricing discipline. We will maintain this approach in order to assure that AIG receives adequate returns for the risks we accept. While industry pricing has eroded more than it should have in some classes of business, we are still able to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new business as a result of our broad product line and extensive distribution reach. "At September 30, 2004, General Insurance net loss and loss adjustment reserves totaled $43.82 billion, an increase of $3.04 billion ($2.30 billion excluding catastrophe losses) and $7.17 billion ($6.44 billion excluding catastrophe losses) for the third quarter and nine months, respectively. "In the United States, the Domestic Brokerage Group had excellent premium growth of 20.6 percent in the third quarter. We continue to benefit from a flight to quality in a number of key lines of business. Net premiums written were a record $6.19 billion. The combined ratio was 101.76, or 94.95 excluding catastrophe losses, compared to 94.78, or 93.74 excluding catastrophe losses, in the third quarter of 2003. "The Domestic Personal Lines business had good premium growth. Third quarter underwriting performance was solid, even with the impact of catastrophes. Third quarter operating income was $72.7 million, or $97.4 million excluding catastrophe losses, compared to $74.9 million, or $79.9 million excluding catastrophe losses, a year ago. Net premiums written were $1.09 billion, up 18.7 percent over a year ago. The combined ratio -more-
-7- was 97.69, or 95.41 excluding catastrophe losses, compared to 97.20, or 96.66 excluding catastrophe losses, a year ago. "HSB Group, Inc. had outstanding underwriting results and continues to expand its global client base. The third quarter 2004 combined ratio was 74.42 including catastrophe losses. "United Guaranty Corporation (UGC) had another good quarter. Premiums grew and refinancings continued to decline as interest rates rose. UGC's delinquency ratio remains well below the industry average. UGC is moving forward with plans to enter new international markets. "The results of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. were impacted by the high level of catastrophes in the quarter. The third quarter combined ratio was 113.01, or 95.47 excluding catastrophe losses, compared to 96.16, or 95.76 excluding catastrophe losses, a year ago. Net premiums written grew 9.6 percent, to $987.4 million. "AIG's Foreign General Insurance operations had excellent results even though they were adversely impacted by the Asia typhoons and hurricanes in the Caribbean. Premiums in the third quarter were up 23.4 percent to $2.30 billion. The combined ratio was 92.95, or 86.61 excluding catastrophe losses, compared to 88.31, or 87.39 excluding catastrophe losses, a year ago. "The Far East region had excellent growth. In Japan, corporate and personal accident business expanded. Commercial lines in Europe continue to exhibit strong growth, as did our personal lines operations in Brazil and Latin America. Additionally, our joint venture in India has expanded its commercial lines leadership among the private sector companies. LIFE INSURANCE & RETIREMENT SERVICES "Worldwide Life Insurance & Retirement Services had outstanding results. Operating income before realized capital gains (losses) was a record $2.19 billion, an increase of 19.9 percent, compared to $1.83 billion in the third quarter of 2003. Worldwide Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums were $7.37 billion, an increase of 32.1 percent over the third quarter of 2003. Premiums, deposits and other considerations totaled $17.25 billion, up 27.9 percent compared to the third quarter of 2003. Cash flow continues to be outstanding. "AIG's Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations had outstanding results. Operating income excluding realized capital gains (losses) was a record $1.23 billion in the third quarter compared to $992.6 million a year ago. GAAP premiums were $5.78 billion, up 38.8 percent. Excluding a reinsurance transaction involving the group products segment's terminal funding business, third quarter 2004 GAAP premiums increased approximately 23 percent. Premiums, deposits and other considerations were $10.65 billion, compared to $6.09 billion in the third quarter of 2003. -more-
-8- "In Japan, we have an agreement and have obtained regulatory approvals that will enable the Sumitomo Life Insurance Company to market insurance products underwritten by ALICO. Sumitomo will initially market ALICO's cancer insurance coverage through the Sumitomo sales channel of approximately 40,000 sales representatives. ALICO and Sumitomo have also agreed to consider expanding the relationship to include other insurance products in the future. "Our life insurance businesses in Japan - ALICO, AIG Star Life, and AIG Edison Life - all had good results in the quarter, benefiting from their financial strength, diversified product portfolio and broad distribution. Total first year premiums increased 31.3 percent. "In China, our life operations also had a good quarter. Life insurance first year premiums were up 23.4 percent, significantly in excess of the industry average. The timing of sales contests can affect the quarter-over-quarter and sequential sales results. Additionally, personal accident sales reflect the repricing of certain key products to improve profit margins. "AIG's Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses are on target for the quarter. Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income excluding realized capital gains (losses) totaled $962.1 million in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 15.0 percent compared to $836.4 million in the third quarter of 2003. GAAP premiums were $1.59 billion, up 12.2 percent. Premiums, deposits and other considerations were $6.60 billion compared to $7.40 billion in the third quarter of 2003 with a significant part of the decrease related to lower fixed annuity sales that resulted from our disciplined response to inadequate competitor pricing. "Life Insurance results from term, universal and structured settlement products were particularly strong. Restructuring at the home services business, AGLA, is proceeding under a new president who has significant experience in this business. He is implementing structural changes and developing new strategies. We believe this is a potentially valuable distribution channel that will be able to make a meaningful contribution to our overall growth. "Domestic retirement services had a good quarter as all three main businesses - group retirement products and individual fixed and variable annuities - reported solid growth in operating income due to improvements in U.S. equity markets and increased fixed annuity balances over the past year. -more-
-9- FINANCIAL SERVICES "Financial Services had operating income of $655.5 million in the third quarter of 2004, compared to $608.3 million a year ago. "International Lease Finance Corporation reported operating income of $204.3 million in the quarter, compared to $190.5 million in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding the impact of the securitization of approximately $2 billion in aircraft in late 2003 and early 2004, these results would have increased approximately 12.8 percent from third quarter 2003. Lease rates have firmed considerably, as a result of strong demand spurred by a rapidly recovering global commercial aviation market, especially in Asia. Sales have begun to pick up, and we expect them to be even stronger in future periods. "Capital Markets operating income was $247.7 million, up modestly from the second quarter of 2004 and third quarter of 2003. We have a diverse product portfolio. The consolidation of AIG Trading Group into AIG Financial Products Corp. continues to meet its strategic objective of providing clients a full range of solutions. "Consumer Finance again had excellent results in both domestic and foreign operations. Operating income increased 17.5 percent to $203.9 million. In the United States, credit quality remains strong and receivables grew significantly. Foreign consumer finance operations performed very well as the operations in Poland continued its strong growth and the Hong Kong credit card business benefited from the strengthening local economy. ASSET MANAGEMENT "Asset Management operating income was $353.1 million in the third quarter of 2004 compared to $208.1 million last year. Third quarter 2004 institutional asset management results include $116 million in third party limited partner earnings from certain AIG managed private equity and real estate funds, now required to be consolidated according to FIN46R. Assets under management grew $1 billion to over $50 billion. Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) will continue to be sold on an opportunistic basis. "In the Other Income/Deductions - net category, AIG reported a loss of $93.1 million in the third quarter of 2004 ($19.4 million loss excluding the catastrophe losses of minority owned companies), compared to a loss of $97.7 million a year earlier. The underlying improvement continues to be primarily attributable to increased income related to SunAmerica partnership investments." -more-

CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 and AIG's past and future filings and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the business environment in which AIG operates and the important factors that may affect its business.

-11- COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release, including the financial highlights and supplementary earnings data, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein. Throughout this press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use AIG's financial information in evaluating the performance of AIG. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net income and operating income, AIG shows both net income and operating income exclusive of realized capital gains (losses) and catastrophe losses. Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income (or loss) and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of both life and general insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In sum, investment income and realized capital gains or losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance. AIG believes that a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, and it evaluates the performance of and manages its operations on that basis. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it much more difficult for users of AIG's financial information to evaluate AIG's success or failure in its basic business, that of insurance underwriting, and may, in AIG's opinion, lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The equity analysts who follow AIG exclude the realized capital gains and losses in their analyses for the same reason, and consistently request that AIG provide the non-GAAP information. AIG presents net income and operating income excluding catastrophe losses because those losses are deemed to be significant for the third quarter and nine months 2004. AIG believes that this separate presentation is both meaningful and useful for users of AIG's financial information. AIG presents life and retirement services production (premiums, deposits and other considerations), net premiums written and combined ratios in accordance with accounting principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors.

NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL INVESTIGATION As previously disclosed, on October 14, 2004, the New York State Attorney General brought a lawsuit challenging certain insurance brokerage practices related to contingent commissions. Neither AIG nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in that action, although the lawsuit names several insurance companies, including AIG subsidiaries, as participants in the challenged practices, and two employees of an AIG subsidiary have pleaded guilty in connection with the Attorney General's investigation. AIG expects there will be additional investigations, and that various parties, including insureds and shareholders, will assert claims against AIG or its subsidiaries. AIG is actively investigating these matters, but the extent, timing and outcome of any related claims are uncertain. AIG cannot at this time estimate its potential costs related to these matters and accordingly, no reserve is being established in AIG's financial statements at this time. In the opinion of AIG management, AIG's ultimate liability for these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect would be material to AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.
