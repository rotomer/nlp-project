EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS [AIG LOGO] Contact: Charlene Hamrah (Investment Community) 212/770-7074 Joe Norton (News Media) 212/770-3144 AIG ANNOUNCES SIGNIFICANT DETAILS OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ON BRIGHTPOINT, INC. AND THE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC. NEW YORK, November 24, 2004 - As announced by American International Group, Inc. (AIG) on November 23, 2004, AIG and its subsidiary AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP) have submitted an offer of settlement to the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the Staff has agreed to recommend to the SEC, and reached agreement in principle with the Fraud Section of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), with respect to issues arising from certain structured transactions with Brightpoint, Inc., The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), and related matters. The proposed agreement with the SEC, under which AIG will not admit or deny any wrongdoing, will fully resolve all claims against AIG and its subsidiaries regarding the transactions and related public statements and press releases. Pursuant to the proposed agreement, AIG will pay into an SEC disgorgement fund approximately $46 million in fees (and interest on the fees) on the PNC transactions. In addition, AIG will be enjoined from future violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws. The Brightpoint transaction was settled with the SEC in 2003. The proposed settlement includes the appointment of an independent consultant who will review certain transactions entered into between 2000 and 2004 to determine whether the transactions were used by a counterparty to violate GAAP or obtain a specified accounting or reporting result. The consultant will be mutually agreed upon by the SEC, the DOJ, and AIG. The proposed settlement also requires AIG to establish a transaction review committee. The independent consultant will review the policies and procedures of the transaction review committee. AIGFP will pay a penalty of $80 million to the DOJ. The proposed settlement with the DOJ consists of an agreement with respect to AIG and AIGFP and a complaint and deferred prosecution agreement with AIGFP PAGIC Equity Holding Corp. (PAGIC) that will foreclose future prosecutions in connection with the PNC and Brightpoint transactions, provided that the companies comply with the agreements. AIG Chairman M. R. Greenberg said, "This proposed settlement will be comprehensive and bring finality to the claims raised by the SEC and the DOJ. It is in the best interests of our shareholders, customers and employees to reach this settlement." This press release may contain forward-looking statements.
