EXHIBIT 99.1 NEWS [AIG LOGO] Contact: Charlene Hamrah (Investment Community) (212) 770-7074 Joe Norton (News Media) (212) 770-3144 AIG REPORTS RECORD 2004 NET INCOME OF $11.05 BILLION ($4.19 PER SHARE), AN INCREASE OF 19.1 PERCENT OVER 2003; NET INCOME EXCLUDING REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES INCREASED 12.1 PERCENT TO $11.46 BILLION ($4.35 PER SHARE); NET INCOME EXCLUDING REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES, CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES, CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND SETTLEMENT CHARGE INCREASED 18.8 PERCENT TO $12.19 BILLION ($4.63 PER SHARE) NEW YORK, NY, February 9, 2005 - American International Group, Inc. (AIG) today reported that its net income for the full year 2004 increased 19.1 percent to a record $11.05 billion or $4.19 per share, compared to $9.27 billion or $3.52 per share in 2003. Net income excluding realized capital gains (losses) and cumulative effect of accounting changes was $11.46 billion or $4.35 per share, compared to $10.22 billion or $3.88 per share in 2003. Full year 2004 after-tax net catastrophe losses from hurricanes, typhoons, earthquake and tsunamis were $682.7 million or $0.26 per share, compared to after-tax net catastrophe losses of $46.2 million or $0.02 per share in 2003. Full year and fourth quarter 2004 catastrophe losses include an additional $126.9 million, or $0.05 per share, in net after-tax catastrophe losses in connection with late reported losses from the third quarter hurricanes and typhoons. The additional charge is a result of the magnitude of damage from a rapid succession of storms and the shortages in labor and materials required for an efficient and timely rebuilding effort in Florida and other areas impacted by the storms. Fourth quarter and full year 2004 catastrophe losses also include a net after-tax charge of $43.6 million, or $0.02 per share, from the South Asian earthquake and tsunamis. The final settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana with respect to issues arising from certain transactions with Brightpoint, Inc., The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and related matters resulted in an after-tax charge of $53.0 million or $0.02 per share for the full year of 2004. Net income for 2004 excluding realized capital gains (losses), cumulative effect of accounting changes, catastrophe losses and the settlement charge increased 18.8 percent to $12.19 billion or $4.63 per share, compared to $10.26 billion or $3.90 per share in 2003.
TWELVE MONTHS (in millions, except per share amounts) (unaudited) * Reflects the adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-8 "Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings per Share." The impact on net income was $0.01 per share for the years 2004 and 2003. ** Represents the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of tax, related to SOP 03-1 "Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts" in 2004 and FIN46R "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" in 2003. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 rose 11.5 percent to $3.02 billion or $1.15 per share, compared to $2.71 billion or $1.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the fourth quarter 2004, net income excluding realized capital gains (losses) and the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased 11.6 percent to $3.07 billion or $1.17 per share, compared to $2.75 billion or $1.05 per share in the same period of 2003. 2
Fourth quarter 2004 after-tax net catastrophe losses were $170.5 million or $0.07 per share, compared to no catastrophe losses incurred in the same period of 2003. The above mentioned settlement resulted in a fourth quarter 2004 after-tax charge of $53.0 million or $0.02 per share. For the fourth quarter of 2004, net income excluding realized capital gains (losses), the cumulative effect of an accounting change, catastrophe losses and the settlement charge increased 19.7 percent to $3.29 billion or $1.26 per share, compared to $2.75 billion or $1.05 per share in the same period of 2003. FOURTH QUARTER (in millions, except per share amounts) (unaudited) * Reflects the adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-8 "Accounting Issues Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings per Share." The impact on net income was $0.01 per share for the years 2004 and 2003. ** Represents the cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of tax, related to FIN46R "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" in 2003. 3
Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes for the full year 2004 was $17.25 billion, a 24.0 percent increase over $13.91 billion in 2003. Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $4.61 billion, a 13.9 percent increase over $4.05 billion in the same period of 2003. The following chart provides a summary of the realized capital (gains) losses, catastrophe losses and settlement charge included in these results: (a) AIG's share is $129.0 million in 2004 and $2.1 million in 2003 and $30.0 million in the fourth quarter 2004. (b) Relates to minor property-casualty subsidiaries currently in runoff. 4
HIGHLIGHTS OF CONSOLIDATED 2004 RESULTS INCLUDE: * Indicates a record. (a) Represents the sum of General Insurance net premiums earned, GAAP Life Insurance & Retirement Services premiums, net investment income, Financial Services interest, lease and finance charges, Asset Management advisory and management fees, net investment income with respect to Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) and realized capital gains (losses). (b) Excludes realized capital gains (losses) and cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of tax. (c) See reconciliation to GAAP ROE in the supplementary earnings data. (d) In addition to General Insurance cash flow, includes Life Insurance & Retirement Services cash flow for investment, which generates the investment income necessary to meet policyholder obligations and to provide a profit margin to shareholders, as well as net cash flow from GICs. 5
Commenting on these results, AIG Chairman M. R. Greenberg said, "AIG earned record net income in 2004, even after accounting for the unprecedented devastation from the hurricanes, typhoons, earthquake and tsunamis in the second half of the year, which affected the entire industry. In addition, AIG took a charge of $53.0 million after-tax in the fourth quarter in connection with the previously reported settlement reached concerning the Brightpoint and PNC transactions and related matters. The amount of this charge reflects the fact that part of the total cost of the settlement was borne by the AIG Financial Products Corp. incentive compensation pool. "The diversification of AIG - with its four principal business segments, multiple profit centers and broad geographic presence throughout the world - was an especially valuable strength for AIG in 2004. When one or more businesses does not meet our expectations for reasons such as catastrophe losses, market changes or other issues, we have several other profit centers that perform at or above expectations that can enable us to meet our overall objectives. Our ability to absorb $682.7 million in catastrophe losses, tackle challenging regulatory issues and navigate through a volatile global economic and political environment and still achieve record net income is a testament to the diversity and strength of our franchise. This diversification, coupled with our unsurpassed capital base, is also a pillar of financial security for our customers. "AIG has also taken several steps in response to the regulatory issues that we faced in 2004. We are implementing the settlements of the Brightpoint and PNC transactions. In addition, AIG has been continuing to cooperate with state attorneys general and insurance departments in connection with their investigations of certain practices of brokers and insurers. Approximately 40 outside attorneys have assisted us in our internal review, and they have examined in excess of 850,000 emails and 30,000 documents. Based on all of the information we have today, we continue to believe that the issue that has been the primary focus of the New York Attorney General's investigation of AIG is confined to one broker relationship and one unit, the Excess Casualty Division of American Home Assurance Company. "We will continue to do whatever it takes to assure that every one of our 92,000 employees upholds the highest ethical standards. AIG has formed a Complex Structured Finance Transaction Committee comprised of senior executives from the businesses and from the finance, legal and claims functions to review certain proposed transactions. Since April, AIG Financial Products Corp. has also had its own Transaction Review Committee. "In order to provide the highest standards of risk management throughout the organization, we brought together our credit, market and operational risk management capabilities into one Enterprise Risk Management department, which is led by a senior executive who brings nearly 30 years of experience to the function. "Also, we have augmented on a worldwide basis, in several different languages, our ethics education program to reinforce the standards set forth in our Code of Conduct. We have enhanced the role of the Chief Compliance Officer, who has the support of 250 compliance officers around the world. Employees have a Compliance Help Line they can contact that is accessible in more than 70 languages. "Although we are giving these issues our full attention, they have not distracted us from managing our businesses, serving our customers and performing for our shareholders." 6
GENERAL INSURANCE * Reconciliation in accordance with Regulation G provided in Financial Highlights and Supplementary Earnings Data. General Insurance had a solid year and quarter in the U.S. and around the world, in spite of record levels of catastrophe losses. The full year 2004 combined ratio of 95.02, including 2.49 points of catastrophe losses, demonstrates the strength of our underwriting discipline. Worldwide General Insurance net investment income increased 17.8 percent for the full year 2004, and fourth quarter 2004 net investment income increased 23.1 percent. Strong cash flow as well as very strong partnership income contributed to this growth. General Insurance cash flow totaled a record $14.19 billion in 2004. At December 31, 2004, General Insurance net loss and loss adjustment reserves totaled $46.26 billion, an increase of $9.61 billion and $2.44 billion in the full year and fourth quarter, respectively. In the United States, the Domestic Brokerage Group did well even after accounting for the four hurricanes. Lexington, the largest excess and surplus lines carrier and a major underwriter of property insurance, was significantly impacted by catastrophe losses. Domestic property-casualty rates are generally satisfactory at this time, although in some classes of business, including property, D&O and energy, rates should be firmer. The AIG companies will maintain our standards, however, and not follow rates down to levels considered unacceptable. HSB Group, the leader in equipment breakdown insurance, had another year of record premiums and record underwriting results. Domestic Personal Lines, including the Private Client Group, had solid underwriting results and strong premium growth in 2004. AIG United Guaranty Corporation achieved record premiums in 2004, excellent 7
underwriting results that are substantially better than the overall mortgage guaranty insurance industry and continued expansion of its international operations. Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., which was substantially impacted by record catastrophes in the U.S. and around the world, had operating income of $259.8 million in 2004 compared to $379.6 million last year. Underlying results were strong, as operating income excluding catastrophe losses increased 23.9 percent. Foreign General Insurance, one of AIG's crown jewels, had excellent results in 2004, and performed well in every region around the world. Despite sustaining $217.3 million in catastrophe losses, Foreign General produced $841.5 million in underwriting income, achieved a combined ratio of 88.78 and generated net investment income of $647.5 million. These results are a testament to Foreign General's extensive geographic network, diverse product mix, underwriting skill and broad distribution, which are unmatched in the industry. LIFE INSURANCE & RETIREMENT SERVICES * Reconciliation in accordance with Regulation G provided in Financial Highlights and Supplementary Earnings Data. (a) Restated to conform to 2004 presentation. Worldwide Life Insurance & Retirement Services results were very good overall. AIG's Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations continued to have outstanding results, with record operating income and strong premium growth in both the full year and fourth quarter. AIG's Domestic Life Insurance business had mixed results, while the Domestic Retirement Services business was excellent. The Foreign Life business in Asia achieved - as it has historically - excellent growth and profitability. Japan and China had particularly strong growth and Southeast Asia overall performed satisfactorily. In China, where AIG has a 57 percent market share of the total 2004 premiums written by foreign insurers, first year life insurance premiums increased 36.6 percent in 2004 over the prior year. In addition, we had very good results in Greece, Central Europe and Russia. The Foreign Retirement Services business continues its strong growth as we have built upon our success in Japan and Korea by expanding our extensive distribution network and leveraging our product expertise to introduce annuity products in new markets. In 8
January, AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japan's largest banks, to market a multi-currency fixed annuity. Domestic Life Insurance results from term life, universal life and structured settlement products were strong. However, AGLA, the home services business, lagged our objectives. We are redesigning the company from the ground up, diversifying product offerings, enhancing the capabilities and quality of the sales force and broadening the markets served beyond those historically serviced by AGLA. We expect these steps will begin to show positive results toward the second half of 2005. In the meantime the company generates strong cash flow. Domestic Group Life performance also was weak in 2004, as we discussed in previous quarters. Restructuring efforts in this business are focused on new product introductions, cross selling and other growth strategies. Results should begin to be evident later in 2005. Domestic Retirement Services had outstanding profitability in each of its three principal businesses - group retirement products, individual fixed annuities and individual variable annuities. AIG VALIC, the group retirement business, broke the billion dollar mark in operating income. Annuity and mutual fund deposits were $6.50 billion in 2004 and general and separate account reserves were $56.12 billion at year end, both of which increased approximately 10 percent. The individual fixed annuity business, primarily AIG Annuity, had record operating income in 2004. Rising short-term interest rates in the latter part of 2004 and aggressive competitor pricing contributed to the difficult sales and net flow comparisons, but we have developed strategies to deal with the changing environment. The company will remain disciplined in pricing and return requirements. AIG SunAmerica Retirement Markets, the individual variable annuity business, reported record operating income and sales in 2004. Equity market gains, along with the strong increase in sales and net flows, resulted in a significant improvement in variable annuity fee income when compared to 2003. The decrease in fourth quarter sales followed declining equity markets in the third quarter and the first half of the fourth quarter. We are continuing to increase the size of the wholesale organization as a measure to improve sales. 9
FINANCIAL SERVICES Financial Services overall had a difficult year in 2004. Of the three major components, Consumer Finance, both domestically and internationally, did very well with good top and bottom line growth. International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) had 2004 operating income of $739.4 million, an increase of 1.6 percent over 2003. Excluding the impact of the securitization of approximately $2 billion in aircraft in late 2003 and early 2004, operating income would have increased approximately 6.4 percent in 2004 and 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter 2004. The commercial aviation market showed good momentum in the fourth quarter, as ILFC continued to see net improvements in lease margins and an increasing level of interest from traditional buyers, third party investors and debt providers for the purchase of aircraft from ILFC's extensive lease portfolio. The outlook for 2005 is positive. Capital Markets earned $857.5 million in 2004, and although very profitable overall, these results lagged the prior year. At AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP), the regulatory issue which resulted in the settlement charge had a negative impact on results. However, with the settlement completed, AIGFP is focused on its 2005 business opportunities and should do well going forward. ASSET MANAGEMENT (a) Restated to conform to 2004 presentation. Asset Management operating income was $1.18 billion in 2004, compared to $817.5 million last year. Institutional Asset Management results in 2004 include $195 million in third party limited partner earnings from certain AIG managed private equity and real estate funds, now required to be consolidated under FIN46R. Assets under management increased to over $53 billion at year end. From a virtual start up in 1996, AIG now ranks among the top six institutional asset managers in the world. 10
Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GICs) contributed $636.3 million to operating income in 2004 compared to $546.8 million in 2003. GICs will continue to be sold on an opportunistic basis, and we are implementing a new institutional and retail sales program that should enable us to achieve enhanced rates of return from this business. In the Other Income/Deductions - net category, AIG reported a loss of $104.1 million in 2004 compared to a loss of $464.0 million a year earlier. The underlying improvement continues to be primarily attributable to increased income related to SunAmerica partnership investments. # # # # AIG is the world's leading international insurance and financial services organization, with operations in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. AIG member companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through the most extensive worldwide property-casualty and life insurance networks of any insurer. In the United States, AIG companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and AIG American General is a top-ranked life insurer. AIG's global businesses also include retirement services, financial services and asset management. AIG's financial services businesses include aircraft leasing, financial products, trading and market making. AIG's growing global consumer finance business is led in the United States by American General Finance. AIG also has one of the largest U.S. retirement services businesses through AIG SunAmerica and AIG VALIC, and is a leader in asset management for the individual and institutional markets, with specialized investment management capabilities in equities, fixed income, alternative investments and real estate. AIG's common stock is listed in the U.S. on the New York Stock Exchange and ArcaEx, as well as the stock exchanges in London, Paris, Switzerland and Tokyo. # # # # A conference call for the investment community will be held today at 9:00 a.m. EST. The call will be broadcast live on the Internet at: www.aigwebcast.com The call will be archived at the same URL through Wednesday, February 23, 2005. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 and AIG's past and future filings and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the business environment in which AIG operates and the important factors that may affect its business. AIG is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 11
COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release, including the financial highlights and supplementary earnings data, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein. Throughout this press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use AIG's financial information in evaluating the performance of AIG. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net income and operating income, AIG shows both net income and operating income exclusive of realized capital gains (losses), catastrophe losses and the settlement charge. Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income (or loss) and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of both life and general insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be created as a result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In sum, investment income and realized capital gains or losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance. AIG believes that a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, and it evaluates the performance of and manages its operations on that basis. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it much more difficult for users of AIG's financial information to evaluate AIG's success or failure in its basic business, that of insurance underwriting, and may, in AIG's opinion, lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The equity analysts who follow AIG exclude the realized capital gains and losses in their analyses for the same reason, and consistently request that AIG provide the non-GAAP information. AIG presents net income and operating income excluding catastrophe losses because those losses are deemed to be significant for the twelve months and fourth quarter 2004. AIG believes that this separate presentation is both meaningful and useful for users of AIG's financial information. AIG presents life and retirement services production (premiums, deposits and other considerations), net premiums written and combined ratios in accordance with accounting principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. AIG presents net income and operating income excluding the charge incurred with respect to the final settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana with respect to issues arising from certain transactions with Brightpoint, Inc., the PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and related matters, because AIG considers such charge an unusual and non-recurring item. 12
