Martin J. Sullivan, AIG President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am pleased that we have completed our internal review and filed our 2004 Form 10-K, which reflects the results of our detailed and thorough review of AIG's major business units globally. I want to thank our 92,000 employees who have worked so hard throughout this period serving our customers and building new relationships, as well as those who conducted and assisted in the review process.

"AIG continues to cooperate to the fullest possible extent with all ongoing government and regulatory investigations. "We are embarking on a new era for AIG that will be marked by changes in the way we operate - including greater responsiveness and transparency - while preserving the core values that have enabled us to build an unequaled franchise and effectively meet our customers' needs. I am confident that the changes we are initiating throughout the organization will make AIG an even stronger and better company."
