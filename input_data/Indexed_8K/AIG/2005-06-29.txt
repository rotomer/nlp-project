AIG FILES FIRST QUARTER 2005 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q June 28, 2005 Page 2 Commenting on these results, AIG President and Chief Executive Officer Martin J. Sullivan said, "This was a good quarter for AIG, with all four of our business segments contributing to the growth in net income. These results are a testament to the strength and diversity of our global franchise. "In our General Insurance operations, the combined ratio was an excellent 93.41. Net premiums written increased at a rate of 7.6 percent, reflecting our efforts to maintain pricing discipline and careful risk selection in a moderating rate environment. The Domestic Brokerage Group and Foreign General had strong growth in operating income and recorded combined ratios of 98.33 and 81.66, respectively. DBG's results included $118 million of additional losses incurred resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 Florida hurricanes. The outstanding cash flow from prior years generated excellent returns in net investment income. General insurance cash flow remained robust at $3.54 billion in the first quarter. "Operating income from Life Insurance & Retirement Services rose 24.5 percent in the quarter, reflecting strong growth and profitability in our overseas operations. Japan and Southeast Asia had excellent results, with first year premiums growing 19.3 and 39.3 percent, respectively. Domestic Life Insurance results reflect the effectiveness of AIG American General's product and distribution strategies, as term life, universal life and structured settlement sales outpaced the industry. However, our home service and group life and health businesses continue to perform below our expectations. In addition, the Domestic Retirement Services business was affected by challenging market conditions. The first quarter sales environment for individual variable annuities was affected by the weak domestic equity market performance, while the flattening yield curve and competitive fixed income alternatives affected fixed annuity sales. The regulatory investigations and resulting negative publicity have also caused some producers to be more cautious placing business with our Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations. "In Financial Services, the improved global aviation market and firming lease rates resulted in a 19.4 percent increase in operating income, excluding the effect of FAS 133, at ILFC. Capital Markets operating income, excluding the effect of FAS 133, increased 15.4 percent with good results from commodity-index, foreign exchange and interest rate linked products. Consumer Finance had excellent results both domestically and internationally with operating income up 26.2 percent. "Asset Management operating income, excluding the effect of FIN46R, increased by 29.2 percent in the first quarter as a result of its strong global product portfolio. Third party assets under management increased to over $55 billion from approximately $53 billion at year end 2004.
AIG FILES FIRST QUARTER 2005 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q June 28, 2005 Page 3 "Looking forward, although commercial property-casualty rates have softened both in the United States and internationally, terms and conditions have remained largely unchanged. We continue to see growth opportunities in General Insurance while maintaining underwriting discipline. Although market conditions in certain of our Domestic Life & Retirement Services businesses continue to be challenging, overall our global Life Insurance & Retirement Services business segment is positioned for growth in many of our markets, with an array of products distributed through multiple channels. In Financial Services, we expect that our growing Consumer Finance business in the U.S. and around the world will continue to perform well. The aircraft leasing business is experiencing continued strong demand for its modern, fuel efficient fleet from Asian, Middle Eastern and European airlines. Capital Markets will continue to be affected by the change in credit ratings, as well as the reduced future earnings from certain transactions unwound as a result of a tax law change in the United Kingdom, and will be subject to continuing volatility as a result of FAS 133 accounting. Asset Management has growth strategies for several asset classes and regions throughout the world. Overall, our business will benefit from our continued strong focus on product innovation to meet customer needs, underwriting discipline, prudent expense management and the experience and dedication of our employees around the world." # # # ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL DATA IS AVAILABLE IN THE QUARTERLY FINANCIALS PAGE OF THE INVESTOR INFORMATION SECTION OF WWW.AIGCORPORATE.COM.
