Commenting on second quarter earnings, AIG President and Chief Executive Officer Martin J. Sullivan said, "In a quarter where the company devoted significant time and attention to its internal review, our operations stayed focused on their customers and business, achieving good results. Market conditions and other trends evident in the first quarter largely continued through the second quarter. Worldwide General Insurance, Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services and Consumer Finance were among our best performing businesses. A flat yield curve affected our spread businesses, and transaction volume in Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services and Capital Markets was lower as a result of regulatory and related issues. Our second quarter results were also adversely affected by the recording of a charge for the cumulative effect of the correction of an error relating to certain manufacturers' payments made for the benefit of ILFC. These factors were offset, however, by solid underwriting results and strong investment returns throughout our businesses. "General Insurance operating income before realized capital gains (losses) increased 20.5 percent compared to the second quarter of 2004. The combined ratio was 92.04. Premium growth of 4.2 percent reflects the underwriting discipline that we are maintaining in an environment that has been characterized by softer pricing in the domestic and international markets. Terms and conditions continue to be largely unchanged. The Domestic Brokerage Group had a combined ratio of 96.05, and the Foreign General combined ratio was an excellent 82.04. Domestic Personal Lines had premium growth of 7.5 percent and a combined ratio of 95.92. Mortgage Guaranty had premium growth of 6.6 percent and a delinquency ratio that continues to run well below the industry average. General Insurance cash flow was $2.71 billion and $6.21 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2005, respectively. Pretax third quarter 2005 losses arising from hurricanes Emily and Dennis are estimated to be $40 million. "In the Life Insurance & Retirement Services business, operating income before realized capital gains (losses) and including pricing net investment gains increased 13.1 percent in the second quarter of 2005 compared to a year ago. Our overseas operations were the strongest contributors to these results. In addition to excellent business performance, foreign life results were favorably affected by the weaker U.S. dollar. "Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income before realized capital gains (losses) and including pricing net investment gains increased 18.8 percent. Japan had strong first year premium growth of 31.8 percent in the second quarter, driven by strong life insurance sales at all three of our companies. Total foreign annuity production rose 43.3 percent. We are successfully leveraging the annuity product knowledge we have developed in Japan and Korea into other markets where we have a strong local presence. 3
"Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income before realized capital gains (losses) increased 5.1 percent in the second quarter of 2005. Domestic Life Insurance had mixed results. Following the filing of our 2004 Form 10-K, the advisor-driven brokerage and affluent market platforms experienced good recurring premiums in the last month of the quarter. Payout annuity sales, were negatively affected by the tight spread environment, although margins remain adequate as a result of our pricing discipline. The Domestic Retirement Services business continued to be affected by challenging market conditions. The second quarter sales environment for individual variable annuities was affected by lackluster domestic equity markets, while the flattening yield curve and competitive fixed income alternatives adversely affected fixed annuity sales. "Financial Services operating income, before the effect of FAS 133 and the cumulative effect of the ILFC correction, declined 2.9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2004. Weak Capital Markets results were somewhat offset by excellent results in our global Consumer Finance business. ILFC continues to benefit from improving lease rates and residual values and the demand for the modern, fuel-efficient aircraft they provide. The Capital Markets business was adversely affected by difficult market conditions and customer uncertainty during much of the quarter surrounding the negative ratings actions and the ongoing investigations. American General Finance has continued its strong receivables growth, while maintaining its emphasis on controlling operating expenses and adhering to strict underwriting guidelines, which is reflected in its improving net charge off and delinquency ratios. Robust receivables growth in the Poland consumer finance business and the Taiwan and Hong Kong credit card businesses contributed to the strong performance in the overseas operations. "Asset Management operating income increased by 10.0 percent in the second quarter, or 8.4 percent excluding the effect of FIN46R, compared to second quarter 2004. Third party assets under management increased to over $61 billion from $55 billion at March 31, 2005. Significant new mandates for its International Small Cap Equity, European Government Bond, and High Yield strategies resulted in new assets for the Institutional Asset Management business. The increase in Domestic Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) operating income was primarily due to an increase in partnership income over the prior year. The sharp decline in second quarter GIC deposits reflects the delay in the launch of AIG's previously announced matched investment program. "In conclusion, AIG performed well and demonstrated great resilience in the second quarter of 2005. Our strong global presence, diverse product range and the discipline and dedication of our employees around the world were instrumental in achieving these results." 4

Please refer to the AIG Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2005 and AIG's past and future filings and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a description of the business environment in which AIG operates and the important factors that may affect its business.

COMMENT ON REGULATION G This press release, including the financial highlights, includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included within the relevant tables or in the Second Quarter 2005 Supplementary Financial Data available in the Investor Information section of AIG's corporate website, www.aigcorporate.com. Throughout this press release, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use AIG's financial information in evaluating the performance of AIG. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations, in some cases, revenues, net income, operating income and related rates of performance are shown exclusive of realized capital gains (losses), cumulative effect of an accounting change in 2004, the effect of FIN46R, the effect of FAS 133 and the cumulative effect of the ILFC correction. Although the investment of premiums to generate investment income (or loss) and realized capital gains or losses is an integral part of both life and general insurance operations, the determination to realize capital gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, losses can be recorded as the result of other than temporary declines in value without actual realization. In sum, investment income and realized capital gains or losses for any particular period are not indicative of business performance for such period. AIG believes that a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit, and it evaluates the performance of and manages its operations on that basis. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income and operating income makes it much more difficult for users of AIG's financial information to evaluate AIG's success or failure in its basic business, that of insurance underwriting, and may, in AIG's opinion, lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The equity analysts who follow AIG exclude the realized capital transactions in their analyses for the same reason, and consistently request that AIG provide the non-GAAP information. Life and retirement services production (premiums, deposits and other considerations), gross premiums written, net premiums written and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. 6
