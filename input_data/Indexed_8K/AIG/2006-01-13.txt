Section 8 - Other Events Item 8.01. Other Events. On January 9, 2006, C.V. Starr & Co., Inc. (Starr) announced that it had completed its tender offer to purchase interests in Starr and that all eligible shareholders had tendered their shares. As a result of completion of the tender offer, no AIG executive officer currently holds any Starr interest. In addition, AIG understands that Mr. Brian Schreiber, Senior Vice President - Strategic Planning, has used the proceeds from the tender of his Starr interests to repay a loan extended by a private entity that may be controlled by Mr. M. R. Greenberg. The Starr holdings of AIG's executive officers as of January 1, 2005 were described in AIG's Proxy Statement, dated June 27, 2005. The tender offer price was 1.42 times the liquidation value of the Starr interests. AIG previously disclosed that its Compensation Committee adopted a Senior Partners compensation plan. This plan is part of AIG's efforts to provide replacements for the investment opportunity and related retention benefit historically provided by the Starr holdings. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
