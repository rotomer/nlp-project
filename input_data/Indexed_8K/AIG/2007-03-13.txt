(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and provided, further, that the foregoing indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a), with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, where (i) prior to the Applicable Time the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in a further amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and such corrected Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter prior to the Applicable Time, (iii) such corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the contract for sale of the Securities to such person and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above. (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or -11-
arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied -12-
by the Company on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriters, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "UNDERWRITER" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in -13-
subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriters except as provided in Section 9 hereof. 13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly. All statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Underwriter, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail as set forth in Schedule I hereto under such Underwriter's name, and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to 70 Pine Street, New York, New York 10270, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 785-1584, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any -14-
Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect (other than services rendered by any of the Underwriters in its role as a joint structuring advisor), or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 17. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 18. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement. 19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. -15-
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by each of you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and each of you in accordance with its terms.

SCHEDULE III Form of Opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March __, 2007 (the "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "UNDERWRITERS"), of $__________ aggregate principal amount of the Company's _____% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "SECURITIES") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of March __, 2007, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated March __, 2007 (together, the "INDENTURE"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "TRUSTEE"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that: (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. (2) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, III-1
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. (3) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we express no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We have also relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the specimen thereof examined by us, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified. Very truly yours, ----------------------------------------- III-2
FORM OF LETTER OF SULLIVAN & CROMWELL LLP March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of $__________ aggregate principal amount of _____% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") of American International Group, Inc. (the "Company"). The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed on different dates on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Commission on July 24, 2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates. III-3
As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, as of the effective date of Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of [__:00] [A/P].M. on March __, 2007 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), [when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement,] contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or III-4
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this paragraph has caused us to believe that (a) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, [when considered together with any other disclosures added in the Prospectus Supplement,] as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures", "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued or the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Securities, or insofar as they relate to provisions of U.S. Federal tax law therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statements, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued. III-5
This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person.

Morgan Securities Inc., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company. This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of $_____ aggregate principal amount of the Company's _____% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of March __, 2007, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated March __, 2007 (together, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") on different dates on Form S-3. The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 24, 2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration IV-1
Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated March [__], 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, you are advised that, in my opinion: (i) The Company has authorized capital as incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus. (ii) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as exhibits thereto, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed. (iii) The issue and sale of the Securities, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental body applicable to the IV-2
Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities and as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. (iv) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of __:00 [A/P].M. on March __, 2007 (the "Applicable Time") (which you have informed me is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or IV-3
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. In rendering the opinion in paragraph (iv), (A) I assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities and the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued therein described, and (B) I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued. In rendering the opinion in paragraph (v), I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of IV-4
internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement. This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2006 are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after December 31, 2006 have, of necessity, been limited. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at March 1, 2007 there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or decrease in consolidated shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; or (b) for the period from January 1, 2007 to March 1, 2007, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net income. Those officials referred to above stated that due to the fact that there is no consolidated financial data available subsequent to December 31, 2006, they are not in a position to comment on whether there was any such change, increase or decrease. 6. This letter is solely for the information of the addressees and to assist the underwriters in conducting and documenting their investigation of the affairs of the Company in connection with the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement, and is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, including but not limited to the registration, purchase, or sale of securities, nor is it to be filed with or referred to in whole or in part in the Registration Statement or any other document, except that reference may be made to it in the underwriting agreement or in any list of closing documents pertaining to the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement.

In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents. Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous. Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument. Section 104. Acts of Holders; Record Dates. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient. -8-
The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security. The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106. The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106. -9-
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount. Section 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with, (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or (2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument, Attention: Secretary, or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company. Section 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made -10-
with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. Section 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of the Trust Indenture Act which is required under such Act to be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be. Section 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. Section 109. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. Section 110. Separability Clause. In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Section 111. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture. Section 112. Governing Law. This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York. Section 113. Legal Holidays. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities (other than a provision of any Security which specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section)) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity; provided, however, that no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, to the date of such payment. -11-

All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at one time and, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above and (subject to Section 303) set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto with respect to a series of Securities, additional Securities of a series may be issued, at the option of the Company, without the consent of any Holder, at any time and from time to time. If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series. -20-
The Securities shall be subordinated in right of payment to Senior Debt as provided in Article Fourteen. Section 302. Denominations. The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman, one of its Vice Chairmen, its President, its Treasurer or one of its Vice Presidents and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating, (1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. -21-
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, including in the event that the size of a series of Outstanding Securities is increased as contemplated by Section 301, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Section 304. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor. -22-
Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "SECURITY REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906, 1107 or 1203 not involving any transfer. If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities: -23-
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable or no longer permitted under applicable law to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security, (C) the Company so directs the Trustee by a Company Order or (D) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. (3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct. (4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section, Section 304, 306, 906, 1107 or 1203 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof. Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed -24-
in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved. Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "DEFAULTED INTEREST") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of -25-
business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. Section 308. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Section 309. Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with its customary procedures. Section 310. Computation of Interest. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Section 311. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing any series of the Securities may use CUSIP numbers, if then generally in use, and thereafter with respect to such series, the Trustee may use such numbers in -26-
any notice of redemption with respect to such series, provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities of that series or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities of that series, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. Section 312. Original Issue Discount. If any of the Securities is an Original Issue Discount Security, the Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on such Outstanding Original Issue Discount Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. ARTICLE FOUR SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE Section 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when (1) either (A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an amount -27-
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive. Section 402. Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. ARTICLE FIVE REMEDIES Section 501. Events of Default. "EVENT OF DEFAULT", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article Fourteen or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (2) default in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity, and continuance of such default for a period of five days; or (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series, and the continuance of such default for a period of five days; or -28-
(4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to -29-
the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. The Company covenants that if (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof and such default continues for a period of five days, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be -30-
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607. No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors' or other similar committee. Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. Section 506. Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: -31-
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; and SECOND: Subject to Article Fourteen, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively. Section 507. Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. Section 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption or repayment, on the Redemption Date or date for repayment, as the case may be) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. -32-
Section 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. Section 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. Section 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. Section 512. Control by Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. Section 513. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default -33-
(1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 514. Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess reasonable costs against any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company. Section 515. Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. ARTICLE SIX THE TRUSTEE Section 601. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. -34-
Section 602. Notice of Defaults. If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series.

(7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; and (8) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder. Section 604. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. Section 605. May Hold Securities. The Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. Section 606. Money Held in Trust. Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company. Section 607. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Company agrees (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed to in writing between the Company and the Trustee for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, -36-
including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or Section 501(6), the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee. Section 608. Conflicting Interests. If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series or a trustee under the Trust Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement with respect to an Issuer Trust. Section 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such, has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and has its Corporate Trust Office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. Section 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611. The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee, at the expense of the Company, -37-
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed, at the expense of the Company, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all -38-
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. Section 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. -39-
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be. No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. Section 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion, consolidation or sale to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. Section 613. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).

The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates). ARTICLE EIGHT CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, CONVEYANCE, TRANSFER OR LEASE Section 801. Company May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain Terms.

Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that if the Board Resolutions and supplemental indenture shall expressly provide that any provisions to be changed or eliminated shall apply to fewer than all the Outstanding Securities hereunder or under a particular series under this Indenture, then, to the extent not inconsistent with the Trust Indenture Act, any such consent may be given by Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities hereunder or under such series to which such change or elimination shall apply; provided, further, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby (whether or not such affected Securities comprise all Securities under this Indenture or under a particular series), (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security or any other Security which would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502, or change any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or (2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or (3) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 513 or Section 1006, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section and Section 1006, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 611 and 901(8). A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more identified series of Securities or particular Securities within an identified series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series, or Holder of particular Securities within a series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed to affect only the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of the identified series or of particular Securities within the identified series, and shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of any other Securities. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. -44-
After a supplemental indenture under this Section 902 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Trustee a notice briefly describing such supplemental indenture or a copy of such supplemental indenture and the Trustee shall mail such notice or supplemental indenture to Holders affected thereby. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, or any failure of the Company to mail such supplemental indenture, shall not in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture. Section 903. Execution of Supplemental Indentures. In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. Section 904. Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. Section 905. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act. Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act. Section 906. Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures. Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series. Section 907. Subordination Unimpaired. This Indenture may not be amended at any time to alter the subordination, as provided herein, of any of the Securities then Outstanding without the written consent of each holder of Senior Debt then outstanding that would be adversely affected thereby. -45-
ARTICLE TEN COVENANTS Section 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest. The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture. Section 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. Section 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will -46-
(1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series. The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. Section 1004. Statement by Officers as to Default. The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. Section 1005. Existence. Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. Section 1006. Waiver of Certain Covenants. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Company may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(19), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series or in -47-
Section 1005 if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. ARTICLE ELEVEN REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES Section 1101. Applicability of Article. Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article. Section 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction. Section 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. If less than all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed (unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. -48-
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. Section 1104. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date; (2) the Redemption Price; (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed; (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date; (5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price; (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and (7) if applicable, the CUSIP numbers of the Securities of that series. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and, unless otherwise specified or contemplated by Section 301, shall be irrevocable. -49-
Section 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date or the Securities of the series provide otherwise) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. Section 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together, if applicable, with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. Section 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. ARTICLE TWELVE SINKING FUNDS Section 1201. Applicability of Article. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any series of Securities is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment -50-
in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of any series of Securities, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of the series as provided for by the terms of such Securities. Section 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities. The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) and (2) may apply as a credit Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as and to the extent provided for by the terms of such Securities; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. Section 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund. Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days prior to each such sinking fund payment date, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107. ARTICLE THIRTEEN DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE Section 1301. Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301, Sections 1302 and 1303 shall apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, in either case, denominated in U.S. dollars and bearing interest at a fixed rate, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 301 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article; and the Company may elect, at its option at any time, to have Section 1302 and 1303 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, designated pursuant to Section 301 as being defeasible pursuant to such Section 1302 or 1303, in accordance with any applicable requirements provided pursuant to Section 301 and upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article. Any such election to have or not to have Sections 1302 -51-
and 1303 apply, as the case may be, shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. Section 1302. Defeasance and Discharge. Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, or if this Section shall otherwise apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations, and the provisions of Article Fourteen shall cease to be effective, with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "DEFEASANCE"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Company may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to the Securities of any series notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 1303 applied to such Securities. Section 1303. Covenant Defeasance. Upon the Company's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, or if this Section shall otherwise apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company shall be released from its obligations under Section 1005 and any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(19), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 501(4) (with respect to Section 1005 and any such covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(19), 901(2) or 901(7)) and 501(7) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default and (3) the provisions of Article Fourteen shall cease to be effective, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "COVENANT DEFEASANCE"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section by reason of any reference in any such Section or to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby. Section 1304. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 1302 or 1303 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be: -52-
(1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee which satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees to comply with the provisions of this Article applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefits of the Holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities. As used herein, "U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATION" means (x) any security which is (i) a direct obligation of the United States of America for the payment of which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any U.S. Government Obligation which is specified in Clause (x) above and held by such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest on any U.S. Government Obligation which is so specified and held, provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depositary receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of principal or interest evidenced by such depositary receipt. (2) In the event of an election to have Section 1302 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date of this instrument, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur. (3) In the event of an election to have Section 1303 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to -53-
Federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur. (4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that neither such Securities nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit. (5) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 501(5) and (6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day). (6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act). (7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound. (8) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act unless such trust shall be registered under such Act or exempt from registration thereunder. (9) No event or condition shall exist that, pursuant to the provisions of Article Fourteen, would prevent the Company from making payments of the principal of (and any premium) or interest on the Securities of such series on the date of such deposit or at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until such 90th day shall have ended). (10) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with (in each case, subject to the satisfaction of the condition in clause (5)). Section 1305. Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Miscellaneous Provisions. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and Section 1306, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to collectively as the "TRUSTEE") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of any Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to -54-
the Holders of such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. Money and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) so held in trust shall not be subject to the provisions of Article Fourteen, provided that the applicable conditions of Section 1304 have been satisfied. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities. Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1304 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities. Section 1306. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Company has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1302 or 1303 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1305 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Company makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust. ARTICLE FOURTEEN SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES Section 1401. Securities Subordinate to Senior Debt.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a deposit referred to in Section 1304(1) is made pursuant to Section 1302 or Section 1303 with respect to any Securities (and provided all other conditions set out in Section 1302 or 1303, as applicable, shall have been satisfied with respect to such Securities), then, when the 90th day after such deposit has ended, no money or U.S. -55-
Government Obligations so deposited, and no proceeds thereon, will be subject to any rights of holders of Senior Debt, including any such rights arising under this Article Fourteen. Section 1402.

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any such payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities, before all Senior Debt is paid in full or payment thereof provided for, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all Senior Debt remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Debt in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt. Any taxes that have been withheld or deducted from any payment or distribution in respect of the Securities, or any taxes that ought to have been withheld or deducted from any such payment or distribution that have been remitted to the relevant taxing authority, shall not be considered to be an amount that the Trustee or the Holder of any Security receives for purposes of this Section. For purposes of this Article only, the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation or other entity provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment which are subordinated in right of payment to all Senior Debt which may at the time be outstanding to substantially the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, or the conveyance, transfer or lease by the Company of its properties and -56-
assets substantially as an entirety to, another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article Eight, or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following any such conveyance or transfer, shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit of creditors or marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease of such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions set forth in Article Eight. Section 1403. Prior Payment to Senior Debt Upon Acceleration of Securities. In the event that any Securities are declared due and payable before their Stated Maturity, then and in such event the holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Debt or provision shall be made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment (including any payment which may be payable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities) by the Company on account of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with Article Twelve by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 1202 Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such declaration of acceleration. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. Section 1404. No Payment When Senior Debt in Default. Subject to the last paragraph of this Section, (a) (i) in the event and during the continuation of any default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Debt beyond any applicable grace period with respect thereto, or (ii) in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Debt shall have occurred and be continuing permitting the holders of such Senior Debt (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to declare such Senior Debt due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable(provided that, in the case of Clause (i) or Clause (ii), if such default in payment or event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist and any such declaration of acceleration shall have been rescinded or annulled, then such default in payment or event of default, as the case may be, shall be deemed not to have occurred for the purpose of this Section) or (b) in the event any judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in payment or event of default that shall be deemed to have occurred for the purpose of this Section, then no payment (including any payment which may be payable by reason of the payment of any other indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Securities) shall be made by the Company on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with -57-
Article Twelve by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 1202 Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such default in payment or event of default. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company. No default in payment or event of default with respect to any Senior Debt shall be deemed to be a default in payment or event of default of the kind specified in Clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of this Section, and no judicial proceeding with respect to any such default in payment or event of default shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding of the kind specified in Clause (b) of this Section, if (x) the Company shall be disputing the occurrence or continuation of such default in payment or event of default, or any obligation purportedly giving rise to such default in payment or event of default, and (y) no final judgment holding that such default in payment or event of default has occurred and is continuing shall have been issued. For this purpose, a "final judgment" means a judgment that is issued by a court having jurisdiction over the Company, is binding on the Company, is in full force and effect and is not subject to judicial appeal or review (including because the time within which a party may seek appeal or review has expired), provided that, if any such judgment has been issued but is subject to judicial appeal or review, it shall nevertheless be deemed to be a final judgment unless the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting such appeal or a proceeding for such review. Section 1405. Payment Permitted in Certain Situations. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time except during the pendency of any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 1402 or under the conditions described in Section 1403 or 1404, from making payments at any time of or on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of the Securities, or (b) the application by the Trustee of any money deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities or the retention of such payment by the Holders, if, at the time of such application by the Trustee, it did not have knowledge that such payment would have been prohibited by the provisions of this Article. Section 1406. Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Debt. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Debt or the provision for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior Debt pursuant to the provisions of this Article (equally and ratably with the holders of indebtedness of the Company which by its express terms is subordinated to indebtedness of the Company to substantially the same extent as the Securities are subordinated to the Senior Debt and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of such Senior Debt to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Debt until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall be -58-
paid in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Debt of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the holders of Senior Debt by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Debt and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior Debt. Section 1407. Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights. The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities on the one hand and the holders of Senior Debt on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Debt and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional (and which, subject to the rights under this Article of the holders of Senior Debt, is intended to rank equally with all other general obligations of the Company), to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect the relative rights against the Company of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior Debt; or (c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of Senior Debt to receive cash, property and securities otherwise payable or deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder. Section 1408. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. Each Holder of a Security by his acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Section 1409. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any non-compliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Debt is -59-
outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Debt; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior Debt; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person. Section 1410. Notice to Trustee. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities, unless and until the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder of Senior Debt or from any trustee therefor; and, prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist. Subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee therefor) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee therefor). In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. Section 1411. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 601, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of Senior Debt and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article. Section 1412. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Debt. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt and shall not be liable to any such holders or creditors if it shall in good faith pay over or distribute to Holders of Securities or to the Company or to any other Person cash, property or -60-
securities to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise. Section 1413. Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Debt; Preservation of Trustee's Rights. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Debt which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Debt and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 607. Section 1414. Article Applicable to Paying Agents. In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee. -61-

"Redemption Price" has the meaning set forth in Section 2.1(q). "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or J.P.

If such rate does not appear on Reuters Screen LIBOR01, Three-month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Interest Period are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the LIBOR Determination Date for that Interest Period, in an amount that, in the Calculation Agent's judgment, is representative of a single transaction in that market at that time. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate.

If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-month LIBOR with respect to that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Interest Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Interest Period and in an amount that, in the Calculation Agent's judgment, is representative of a single transaction in that market at that time. However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are quoting as described above, Three-month LIBOR for that Interest Period will be the same as Three-month LIBOR as determined for the previous Quarterly Interest Period or, in the case of the Quarterly Interest Period beginning on the Scheduled Maturity Date, 5.34%. "Voting Stock" means equity securities which ordinarily have voting power for the election of directors, whether at all times or only so long as no senior class of equity securities has such voting power by reason of any contingency.

ARTICLE TWO GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE DEBENTURES SECTION 2.1 TERMS OF DEBENTURES Pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture, there is hereby established a series of Securities, the terms of which shall be as follows: (a) Designation. The Securities of this series shall be known and designated as the "6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures" of the Company (the "Debentures"). The CUSIP number of the Debentures is 026874BE6. The Bank of New York will act as the paying agent for the Debentures. (b) Aggregate Principal Amount. The maximum aggregate principal amount of the Debentures that may be authenticated and delivered under the Indenture and this First Supplemental Indenture is $1,000,000,000 (except for Debentures authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or exchange for, or in lieu of, other Debentures pursuant to Section 304, 305, 306, 906 or 1107 of the Indenture or Section 3.5 of this First Supplemental Indenture); provided, however, that the Company may from time to time authenticate and deliver under the Indenture and this First Supplemental Indenture up to $1,000,000,000 additional amount of Debentures, which Debentures may accrue interest from a different date than the Debentures, as may be specified pursuant to Section 301 of the Indenture, so long as the Company reasonably determines that the additional Debentures so authenticated and delivered will be fungible for United States federal income tax purposes. From time to time the Company may execute and deliver, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, additional Debentures. (c) Form and Denominations. The Debentures will be issued only in fully registered form, and the authorized denominations of the Debentures shall be $100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Debentures will initially be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities substantially in the form of Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer executing the same. The Debentures will be denominated in U.S. dollars and payments of principal and interest will be made in U.S. dollars. (d) Scheduled Maturity Date. (i) The principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, the Outstanding Debentures shall be payable in full on March 15, 2037, or if such day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date"); provided that in the event the Company has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to clause (vi) of this Section 2.1(d) in connection with the -11-
Scheduled Maturity Date, (A) the principal amount of Debentures payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date, if any, shall be the principal amount set forth in the notice of repayment accompanying such Officers' Certificate, (B) such specified principal amount of Debentures shall be repaid on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to Article III, and (C) subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.1(d), the remaining Debentures shall remain Outstanding and shall be payable on the immediately succeeding Quarterly Interest Payment Date or such earlier date on which they are redeemed pursuant to Section 2.1(o) or shall become due and payable pursuant to Section 502 of the Indenture or clause (iii) of this Section 2.1(d). The Outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date except to the extent so specified in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee not more than 30 and not less than 10 Business Days immediately preceding the Scheduled Maturity Date. (ii) In the event the Company has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to clause (vi) of this Section 2.1(d) in connection with any Quarterly Interest Payment Date, the principal amount of Debentures payable on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be the principal amount set forth in the notice of repayment, if any, accompanying such Officers' Certificate, such principal amount of Debentures shall be repaid on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to Article III, and the remaining Debentures shall remain Outstanding and shall be payable on the immediately succeeding Quarterly Interest Payment Date or such earlier date on which they are redeemed pursuant to Section 2.1(o) or shall become due and payable pursuant to Section 502 of the Indenture or clause (iii) of this Section 2.1(d). The Outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on any Quarterly Interest Payment Date except to the extent so specified in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee not more than 30 and no less than 10 Business Days immediately preceding such Quarterly Interest Payment Date. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this First Supplemental Indenture, the principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all Outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on March 15, 2087, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Final Maturity Date"). (iv) Any repayment of principal and current interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) on any date prior to the Final Maturity Date shall not affect the Company's obligations under Section 2.1(h) with respect to the payment of deferred interest on the Debentures. For the purpose of clarity, it is possible that the Company may repay the principal and current interest on a Debenture pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) but still be obligated to pay deferred interest on the Debenture. For the purposes of the definition of "Outstanding" in the Indenture, a Debenture, as to which principal and current interest has been repaid, redeemed or otherwise satisfied by the Company, shall for all purposes of -12-
the Indenture and this First Supplemental Indenture, other than for purposes of Article XI of the Indenture and Section 2.1(d) and Article III of this First Supplemental Indenture, be deemed Outstanding so long as any deferred interest on such Debenture remains unpaid. (v) Until principal and current interest on all Outstanding Debentures are paid in full, the principal of all Outstanding Debentures is automatically accelerated as provided in Section 2.1(k) or a declaration of acceleration pursuant to Section 502 of the Indenture occurs, the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event: (A) to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds during a 180-day period ending on a date not more than 30 and not less than 10 Business Days prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date to permit repayment of the principal and current interest on all Outstanding Debentures in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date; and (B) if the Company is unable for any reason to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds to permit repayment in full of the principal amount of and current interest on all the Outstanding Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Quarterly Interest Payment Date, to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds to permit repayment of the principal and current interest on all Outstanding Debentures in full on the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 2.1(d). (vi) The Company shall, if it has not raised sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds in connection with any Repayment Date, deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee no more than 30 and no less than 10 Business Days in advance of such Repayment Date stating the amount of Eligible Repayment Proceeds, if any, raised pursuant to clause (v) above in connection with such Repayment Date. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (vi), unless no principal amount of Debentures is to be repaid on the applicable Repayment Date, shall be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 3.1 setting forth the principal amount of the Debentures to be repaid on such Repayment Date, which amount shall be determined after giving effect to clause (viii) of this Section 2.1(d). (vii) The Company shall be excused from its obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (v) above if such Officers' Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing at any time during the period commencing 180 days prior to the date of such Officers' Certificate or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the period commencing on the immediately preceding Quarterly Interest Payment Date and ending on the -13-
Business Day immediately preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate; and (B) either (1) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-day period or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the period since the most recent Quarterly Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, or (2) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the relevant period, but the Company was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the Debentures in full. (viii) Payments on the Debentures on any Repayment Date shall be applied, first, to the extent permitted by Section 2.1(i), to deferred interest to the extent of Eligible APM Proceeds raised pursuant to Section 2.1(i), second, to current interest and, third, to the repayment of the principal of Debentures; provided that if the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and repay any outstanding pari passu securities in addition to the Debentures, then on any date and for any period such payments shall be applied to the Debentures and those other pari passu securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures pro rata in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts and none of such payments shall be applied to any other pari passu securities having a later scheduled maturity date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures has been paid in full, except to the extent permitted by clause (vii) of Section 2.1(g) and the first sentence of Section 2.1(h). If the Company has raised less than $5,000,000 of Eligible Repayment Proceeds during the relevant 180-day or three-month period, the Company will not be required to repay any Debentures on the relevant Repayment Date, but it will repay the applicable principal amount of the Debentures on the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date as of which the Company has raised at least $5,000,000 of Eligible Repayment Proceeds. (e) Rate of Interest. The Debentures shall bear interest (i) from and including March 13, 2007 to but excluding the Scheduled Maturity Date at the rate of 6.25% per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, and (ii) thereafter, as to the principal amount of any Outstanding Debentures, at an annual rate equal to Three-month LIBOR plus 2.056%, computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. All percentages resulting from any calculation of Three-month LIBOR will be rounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to the next higher or lower one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point. Subject to Sections 2.1(g) and (h): (x) prior to and including March 15, 2037, interest on the Debentures shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2007 (each such date, a "Semi-annual Interest Payment Date"), and (y) after March 15, 2037, interest on the Debentures shall be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2037, or if any such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, unless such postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month, in which case it shall be brought forward to the preceding Business Day (each such date, a "Quarterly -14-
Interest Payment Date"). In the event any Semi-annual Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on that date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue as a result of such postponement. Any installment of interest (or portion thereof) deferred in accordance with Section 2.1(g) or otherwise unpaid shall bear additional interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the rate of interest then in effect from time to time on the Debentures, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date, until paid in accordance with Section 2.1(h). (f) To Whom Interest is Payable. Interest (other than deferred interest which shall be payable to the Persons specified pursuant to Section 2.1(g)(ii)) shall be payable to the Person in whose name the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, or in the event the Debentures cease to be held in the form of one or more Global Securities, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to that Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day. (g) Option to Defer Interest Payments. (i) The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time prior to the Final Maturity Date, to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed 10 years; provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the earlier redemption of the Debentures. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or the Company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary, subject to the exceptions specified in clause (vii) of this Section 2.1(g), to: (a) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any Capital Stock of the Company, (b) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures or (c) make any payments with respect to any Guarantee by the Company of the junior subordinated debt securities of any Subsidiary if such Guarantee ranks pari passu with, or junior in interest to, the Debentures. (ii) At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest on the Debentures (together with compounded interest thereon, if any, to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the Person in whose name the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period or, in the event the Debentures cease to be held in the form of one or more Global Securities, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to the end of the Deferral Period, whether or not a Business Day. -15-
(iii) Upon termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest and any compounded interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.1(g). (iv) The Company may elect to pay deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted by Section 2.1(h). (v) The Company shall give written notice to the Trustee and the Holders of the Debentures of its election to begin any Deferral Period at least one Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date for that Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Company's failure to pay any interest due within five Business Days after any Interest Payment Date shall automatically and without any further action by any Person be deemed to commence a Deferral Period. (vi) If any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities ranking junior to or pari passu with any APM Qualifying Securities the proceeds of which were used to pay deferred interest during such Deferral Period until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest has been paid, subject to the exceptions set forth in clause (vii) below. If the Company is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination more than 50% of the surviving or resulting entity's Voting Stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the Business Combination or Continuing Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors of the surviving or resulting entity, then neither the restrictions set forth in this clause (vi) nor the provisions of Section 2.1(h) shall apply to any Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of the Business Combination. (vii) The restrictions in clauses (i) and (vi) of this Section 2.1(g) do not apply to (a) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with (1) any Employee Benefit Plan or the Assurance Agreement or (2) a dividend reinvestment, stock purchase plan or other similar plan, (b) any exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock (or the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary) for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock or of any class or series of Indebtedness of the Company for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock, (c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Capital Stock of the Company in accordance with the conversion or exchange provisions of the Company's Capital Stock or the security or instrument being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' right plan, or the issuance of rights, equity securities or other property under any stockholders' -16-
right plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights in accordance with any stockholders' rights plan, (e) any dividend in the form of equity securities, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks pari passu with or junior to such equity securities, (f) any payment during a Deferral Period of current interest in respect of any debt securities of the Company that rank pari passu with the Debentures that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such pari passu securities and on the Debentures and any payments of deferred interest on such pari passu securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such pari passu securities (provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.1(h) to the extent it applies), (g) any payment of principal in respect of pari passu securities having an earlier scheduled maturity date than the Debentures, as required under a provision of such pari passu securities that is substantially the same as Section 2.1(d) or any such payment in respect of any such pari passu securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of such securities and the Debentures or (h) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing that security. (h) Payment of Deferred Interest. The Company shall not pay deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) on the Debentures on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period from any source other than Eligible APM Proceeds unless (x) required by an applicable regulatory authority, (y) permitted under clause (vi) of Section 2.1(g) or (z) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may pay current interest during a Deferral Period from any available funds. To the extent that the Company is able to raise some, but not all, Eligible APM Proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date, such Eligible APM Proceeds shall be allocated first to deferred payments of accrued and unpaid interest in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred. If any Indebtedness of the Company that ranks pari passu with the Debentures is outstanding in addition to the Debentures under which the Company is obligated to sell APM Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of Eligible APM Proceeds received by the Company from such sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions shall be applied to the Debentures and such pari passu securities on a pro rata basis up to, in the case of Common Stock, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap and the Maximum Share Number, in the case of Qualifying Warrants, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap and the Maximum Warrant Number and, in the case of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing such pari passu securities) in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such pari passu securities. The Company may make such pro rata payments on such pari passu securities so long as it shall have paid or deposited with the -17-
paying agent for the Debentures or shall have segregated and holds in trust for payment the pro rata proceeds applicable to the Debentures that have not been paid. The "Maximum Share Number" will initially equal 100,000,000 and the "Maximum Warrant Number" will initially equal 100,000,000; provided that, if the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Maximum Share Number and the Maximum Warrant Number shall be correspondingly adjusted in a manner reasonably determined by the Company. The Company may, at its discretion and without the consent of the holders of the Debentures, increase the Maximum Share Number or the Maximum Warrant Number or both (including through the increase of the Company's authorized share capital, if necessary) if the Company determines that such increase is necessary to allow the Company to issue sufficient Common Stock and/or Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest on the Debentures. (i) Alternative Payment Mechanism. Immediately following any APM Commencement Date and until the termination of the related Deferral Period, the Company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell APM Qualifying Securities until the Company has raised an amount of Eligible APM Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures (including compounded interest thereon) and applied such Eligible APM Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) in accordance with Section 2.1(h); provided that: (1) the foregoing obligations shall not apply (i) during the first five years of any Deferral Period to the extent the number of shares of Common Stock issued and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Qualifying Warrants, together with the number of shares of Common Stock previously issued and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period to pay interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.1(i), would, in the aggregate, exceed 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements on the date of determination (the "Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap") or (ii) to the issuance of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock at any time to the extent the Eligible APM Proceeds raised from such issuance, together with the Eligible APM Proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(i) applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, would exceed $250,000,000 plus 25% of the aggregate principal amount of any additional Debentures at the time of their initial issuance pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (the "Preferred Stock Issuance Cap"); (2) the foregoing obligations shall not apply in respect of any Interest Payment Date if the Company shall have provided to the Trustee (which the -18-
Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of the Debentures whose name appears in the Security Register) no more than 30 and no less than 10 Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event occurred after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (A) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of such period but the Company was unable after commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible APM Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest due on the Interest Payment Date with respect to which such Officers' Certificate is being delivered; and (3) to the extent that the Company has raised some but not all Eligible APM Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date, such Eligible APM Proceeds shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.1(h). Once the Company reaches the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Company will not be required to issue more shares of Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants under this Section 2.1(i) during the first five years of such Deferral Period even if the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap will cease to apply after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Deferral Period, at which point the Company must pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred pursuant to Section 2.1(h), subject to the limitations in Section 2.1(g), the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, the Maximum Share Number, the Maximum Warrant Number and any Market Disruption Event. In addition, if the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Company subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap will cease to apply at the termination of such Deferral Period, reset to zero and will not apply again unless and until the start of a new Deferral Period. The Preferred Stock Issuance Cap shall not reset to zero even if the Company pays all deferred interest for a Deferral Period, and the Eligible APM Proceeds from sales of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock applied pursuant to Section 2.1(h) during such Deferral Period and all prior Deferral Periods cumulate as Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock is issued to pay deferred interest. The Company will not be excused from its obligations under this Section 2.1(i) if it determines not to pursue or complete the sale of APM Qualifying Securities due to pricing, dividend rate or dilution considerations. (j) Events of Default. The Debentures shall not be entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default in clauses (1) through (4) of Section 501 of the Indenture. The Debentures shall be entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default in clauses (5) and (6) -19-
of Section 501 of the Indenture. The following events shall be Events of Default with respect to the Debentures (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article Fourteen of the Indenture or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of interest, including compounded interest, in full on any Debenture for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of a 10-year period following the commencement of any Deferral Period; (2) default in the payment of the principal of the Debentures at the Final Maturity Date or upon a call for redemption; Except as provided in this paragraph (j), no breach or default by the Company of any other covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Debentures shall constitute an Event of Default. (k) Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission of Amendment. The remedies provided to the Trustee and Holders by Section 502 of the Indenture will apply only to an Event of Default under clause (1) of Section 2.1(j). If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture occurs, then in every such case the principal amount of all the Debentures shall automatically become due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. An Event of Default in clause (2) of Section 2.1(j) shall not entitle the Holders to the benefits of Section 502 of the Indenture. (l) Collection of Indebtedness and Suits From Enforcement by Trustee. The Debentures shall not have the benefits of the first paragraph of Section 503 of the Indenture. (m) Limitation on Suits. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 507 of the Indenture is hereby amended (i) by adding "or Enforcement Event" after "Event of Default" in clause (1) thereof, and (ii) by adding at the end of clause (2) thereof: "or the Holders of no less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Enforcement Event in its own name as Trustee hereunder;" (n) Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 508 of the Indenture is hereby amended and restated in its entirety: "Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture or the First Supplemental Indenture, the Holder of any Debenture shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and -20-
(subject to Section 2.1(g)(ii) of the First Supplemental Indenture and Section 307 of the Indenture) interest on such Debenture when due, it being understood (i) that, in the case of a Deferral Period, interest shall only become due and payable at the time and in the manner provided for in Sections 2.1(g) and (h) of the First Supplemental Indenture, and interest shall, in the case of Section 2.1(i) of the First Supplemental Indenture, only become due and payable in the amount determined in accordance with such Section, and (ii) that the extent to which Holders have a right to receive payment of principal on any Repayment Date is determined in accordance with Section 2.1(d) of the First Supplemental Indenture. Any Holder's right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights referred to in this Section 508 shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder." For the purposes of Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, it is understood and agreed that no payment of principal or interest shall be deemed due and payable under the provisions of Sections 2.1(d), 2.1(g)(ii) and 2.1(h) until the Company has received Eligible Repayment Proceeds or Eligible APM Proceeds, respectively, to pay such principal or interest. (o) Waiver of Past Defaults. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 513 of the Indenture, for the purposes of the Debentures, a past default that is an Event of Default under Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture cannot be waived, with respect to the Debentures and its consequences, without the consent of each Holder of the Debentures. (p) Notice of Defaults and Enforcement Events. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 602 of the Indenture is hereby amended (i) by adding "and Enforcement Events" after "Defaults" in the header thereof, and (ii) by adding "or Enforcement Event" after "default" in the first and second line of such Section. (q) Redemption. The Debentures shall be redeemable in accordance with Article Eleven of the Indenture, provided that the Debentures are redeemable at any time (i) in whole or in part at the option of the Company or (ii) in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event or a Tax Event at a "Redemption Price" equal to (1) 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date or (2) in the case of any such redemption prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, if greater, the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. In the event of any redemption in part prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures Outstanding after such redemption must be not less than $50,000,000. For purposes of the Debentures, the first sentence of Section 1104 of the Indenture is replaced in its entirety with the following: "Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holders of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register. -21-

The Company shall not modify the Replacement Capital Covenant to (A) amend the definitions incorporated into this First Supplemental Indenture pursuant to Section 1.2.3(b) in a manner adverse to the Holders or (B) impose additional restrictions on the type or amount of Qualifying Capital Securities that the Company may include for purposes of determining the extent to which repayment, redemption, defeasance or repurchase of the Debentures is permitted, except with the consent of the holders of a majority of the principal amount of Outstanding Debentures. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, the Company may modify the Replacement Capital Covenant at any time and in any manner without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures. (s) Limitation on Claims in the Event of Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Receivership. To the extent permitted by law, each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur prior to the redemption, repayment or defeasance of such Debentures, such Holder shall only have a claim for deferred and unpaid interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent such interest (including compounded interest thereon) relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not so been paid. (t) Sinking Fund; Holder Repurchase Right. The Debentures shall not be subject to any sinking fund or analogous provision or be redeemable at the option of the Holders. (u) Forms. The Debentures shall be substantially in the form of Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer executing the same. (v) Subordination. The Debentures shall be subject to Article XIV of the Indenture, subject to the following modifications: (i) For purposes of the Debentures, the "or" before clause (iii) of the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture is deleted, the following clauses are added to the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture after the word "contracts," in clause (iii) for purposes of the Debentures: ", (iv) any subordinated or junior subordinated debt that by its terms is not expressly pari passu or subordinated to the Debentures, (v) any Guarantee of any indebtedness, obligation or security issued by any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company and such Person is viewed by the Company as a vehicle to finance its operations, and (vi) Indebtedness of the Company to its Subsidiaries"; and (ii) For purposes of the Debentures, the following provision is added to the end of the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture after the word "Securities": "provided that (a) trade account payables and accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business, (b) the Company's 5.75% Series A-2 Junior -22-
Subordinated Debentures and 4.875% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures and (c) any other indebtedness, Guarantee or other obligation that is specifically designated as being subordinate, or not superior, in right of payment to the Debentures, shall not be considered Senior Debt". (iii) For purposes of the Debentures, the provisions of Section 1404 of the Indenture shall only apply in the case where (A) there has been an event of default with respect to Senior Debt within the meaning of clause (i) of the definition of Senior Debt, (B) the principal amount of such Senior Debt has been accelerated, (C) the outstanding principal amount of Senior Debt at the time of acceleration is at least $100,000,000 and (D) the event of default or acceleration has not been cured, waived, or otherwise ceased to exist.

The Company shall, not more than 30 nor less than 10 Business Days prior to each Repayment Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of the principal amount of Debentures to be repaid on such date pursuant to Section 2.1(d). 3.2. SELECTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REPAID. If less than all the Debentures are to be repaid on any Repayment Date, the particular Debentures to be repaid shall be selected not more than 30 days prior to such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures not previously repaid or redeemed or as to which notice of repayment or redemption has been given, by such other method as the Trustee may deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for repayment of a portion of the principal amount of any Debenture, provided that the portion of the principal -23-
amount of any Debenture not repaid shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination). The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debentures selected for partial repayment and the principal amount thereof to be repaid. For all purposes hereof, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the repayment of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debenture repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debenture which has been or is to be repaid. 3.3. NOTICE OF REPAYMENT. Notice of repayment shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than the 15th calendar day, and not earlier than the 10th calendar day, prior to the Repayment Date, to each Holder of Debentures to be repaid, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register. Each notice of repayment shall identify the Debentures to be repaid (including CUSIP number, if a CUSIP number has been assigned to the Debentures) and shall state: (a) the Repayment Date; (b) if less than all Outstanding Debentures are to be repaid, the identification (and, in the case of partial repayment, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Debentures to be repaid; (c) that on the Repayment Date, the principal amount of the Debentures or portions thereof to be repaid will become due and payable, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date; (d) whether any deferred interest shall remain outstanding on any Debentures to be repaid, and if so, the amount of such deferred interest and that compound interest thereon shall continued to accrue on and after said date until paid; and (e) the place or places where such Debentures are to be surrendered for payment of the principal amount thereof.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. No. CUSIP No.: $ American International Group, Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million Dollars ($500,000,000) on March 15, 2087, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Final Maturity Date"); provided that the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, this Security shall be payable in full on March 15, 2037, or if such day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date"), or any subsequent Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to the extent set forth in the Indenture hereinafter referred to. As provided in the Indenture, the principal of this Security is payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date only to the extent the Company has raised sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds. The Company's obligation to raise Eligible Repayment Proceeds is subject to certain limitations and restrictions described in the First Supplemental Indenture hereinafter referred to. In connection with the issuances of this Security, the Company has entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant that contains restrictions on the Company's ability to repay the principal of this Security. This Security shall bear interest (i) from and including March 13, 2007 to, but excluding the Scheduled Maturity Date, payable (subject to deferral as set forth herein
and in the Indenture) at the rate of 6.25% per annum semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing September 15, 2007 (computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and (ii) from and including the Scheduled Maturity Date, at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR (as defined in the Indenture) plus 2.056% (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed), payable (subject to deferral as set forth herein and in the Indenture) quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 in each year, commencing June 15, 2037, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment (each such date referred to in clause (i) or (ii), an "Interest Payment Date"). In the event that any Interest Payment Date on or before the Scheduled Maturity Date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on that date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue as a result of that postponement. In the event that any Interest Payment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, that Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day; however, if the postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will instead be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. Any installment of interest (or portion thereof) deferred in accordance with the Indenture or otherwise unpaid on the relevant Interest Payment Date shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the rate of interest then in effect on this Security, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date, until paid in accordance with the Indenture. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed and (ii) on or after the Scheduled Maturity Date, a day which is not a London Banking Day. The interest (other than deferred interest) so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered (i) at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date if this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, or (ii) the close of business on the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date if this Security is not issued in the form of a Global Security. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for (other than deferred interest) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Any deferred interest shall be payable to the holder of record of this Security as provided below. A-2
The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, prior to the Final Maturity Date to defer the payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed 10 years; provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the earlier redemption of the Securities of this series. As provided in the Indenture, the payment of deferred interest is subject to the Company's ability to raise Eligible APM Proceeds. The Company's obligation to raise Eligible APM Proceeds is subject to certain limitations, restrictions and exceptions described in the First Supplemental Indenture. At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest on this Security (together with compounded interest thereon, if any, to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period or, in the event this Security ceases to be held in the form of a Global Security, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to the end of the Deferral Period, whether or not a Business Day. Upon termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest and any compounded interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements and those in the Indenture. The Company may elect to pay deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted, and shall pay deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent required, by the Indenture. To the extent permitted by law, each Holder of this Security, by such Holder's acceptance of this Security agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of this Security, such Holder shall only have a claim for deferred and unpaid interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent such interest (including compounded interest thereon) relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not so been paid. The Company shall give written notice to the Trustee and the Holders of this Security of its election to begin any Deferral Period at least one Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date for that Interest Payment Date, provided, however, that the Company's failure to pay any interest due within five Business Days after any Interest Payment Date shall automatically and without any further action by any Person be deemed to commence a Deferral Period. Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. A-3
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to $1,000,000,000 (except for Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration or transfer of, or exchange for, or in lieu of, other Securities pursuant to Section 304, 305, 306, 906, or 1107 of the Base Indenture or Section 3.5 of the First Supplemental Indenture); provided, however, that the Company may from time to time authenticate and deliver under the Indenture up to $1,000,000,000 additional principal amount of Securities which may accrue interest from a different date than this Security, as may be specified pursuant to Section 301 of the Base Indenture, so long as the company reasonably determines that the additional Securities so authenticated and delivered will be fungible for United States federal income tax purposes. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days' prior notice by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at any time (i) in whole or in part, at the option of the Company or (ii) in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event or a Tax Event, subject to the terms and conditions of the First Supplemental Indenture and Article XI of the Base Indenture, at a Redemption Price of 100% of their principal amount or, in the case of any such redemption prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, if greater, the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price, in either case, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof; provided, however, that in the event of any redemption in part of the Securities of this series prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series Outstanding after such redemption must be not less than $50,000,000. The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all A-6
Senior Debt, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee as his or her attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his or her acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Debt, whether now outstanding or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed, and waives reliance by each such holder of Senior Debt upon said provisions. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security at any time prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Securities of this series are entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default described in Section 2.1(j) of the First Supplemental Indenture and the Enforcement Events as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture. The Holder of this Security and the Trustee shall be entitled to the remedies provided by Section 502 of the Base Indenture only if an Event of Default specified in clause (1) of Section 2.1(j) of the First Supplemental Indenture shall occur with respect to the Securities of this series. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or Section 501(6) of the Base Indenture shall occur with respect to the Securities of this series, then in every such case the principal amount of all the Securities of this series shall become automatically due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. An Event of Default specified in clause (2) of Section 2.1(j) of the First Supplemental Indenture shall not entitle the Holders to the benefits of Section 502 of the Base Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless A-7
such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default or Enforcement Event with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% (or, in the case of an Enforcement Event, a majority) in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default or Enforcement Event, as the case may be, as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates to the extent provided by Section 2.1(n) of the First Supplemental Indenture. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires beneficial interest in, this Security agree that, for United States federal, state and local tax purposes, it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness.

RECITALS A. On the date hereof, the Corporation is issuing $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures due March 15, 2087 (the "Debentures"). B. This Replacement Capital Covenant is the "Replacement Capital Covenant" referred to in the Prospectus Supplement, dated March 6, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), relating to the Debentures. C. The Corporation is entering into and disclosing the content of this Replacement Capital Covenant in the manner provided below with the intent that the covenants provided for in this Replacement Capital Covenant be enforceable by each Covered Debtholder and that the Corporation be estopped from disregarding the covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. D. The Corporation acknowledges that reliance by each Covered Debtholder upon the covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant is reasonable and foreseeable by the Corporation and that, were the Corporation to disregard its covenants in this Replacement Capital Covenant, each Covered Debtholder would have sustained an injury as a result of its reliance on such covenants. NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation hereby covenants and agrees as follows in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder. SECTION 1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Replacement Capital Covenant (including the Recitals) have the meanings set forth in Schedule I hereto. SECTION 2. Limitations on Redemption and Repurchase of Debentures. The Corporation hereby promises and covenants to and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder that the Corporation shall not repay, redeem, defease or purchase, and no Subsidiary of the Corporation shall purchase, all or any part of the Debentures prior to March 15, 2067, except to the extent that the principal amount repaid or defeased or the applicable redemption or purchase price does not exceed the sum of the following amounts: (i) the Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount of (a) the net cash proceeds the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have received from the sale of Common Stock and rights to acquire Common Stock to Persons other than the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, (b) the Market Value of any Common Stock (or rights to acquire Common Stock) the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have delivered as consideration for property or assets in an arms length transaction and (c) the Market Value of any Common Stock that the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have issued to persons other than the Corporation and its Subsidiaries in connection with the conversion of any convertible or exchangeable securities, other than securities for which the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries has received equity credit from any NRSRO, in each case
since the most recent Measurement Date (without double counting proceeds received in any prior Measurement Period); plus (ii) the Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have received within a Measurement Period (without double counting proceeds received in any prior Measurement Period) from the sale of Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and Debt Exchangeable for Equity to Persons other than the Corporation and its Subsidiaries; plus (iii) the Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds that the Corporation and its Subsidiaries have received within a Measurement Period (without double counting proceeds received in any prior Measurement Period) from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities to persons other than the Corporation and its Subsidiaries; provided that the limitations in this Section 2 shall not restrict the repayment, redemption or other acquisition of any Debentures that the Corporation has previously defeased in accordance with this Replacement Capital Covenant. SECTION 3. Covered Debt. (a) The Corporation represents and warrants that the Initial Covered Debt is Eligible Senior Debt. (b) On or during the 30-day period immediately preceding any Redesignation Date with respect to the Covered Debt then in effect, the Corporation shall identify the series of Eligible Debt that will become the Covered Debt on and after such Redesignation Date in accordance with the following procedures: (i) the Corporation shall identify each series of its then outstanding unsecured, long-term indebtedness for money borrowed that is Eligible Debt; (ii) if only one series of the Corporation's then outstanding unsecured, long-term indebtedness for money borrowed is Eligible Debt, such series shall become the Covered Debt commencing on the related Redesignation Date; (iii) if the Corporation has more than one outstanding series of unsecured, long-term indebtedness for money borrowed that is Eligible Debt, then the Corporation shall identify the series that has the latest occurring final maturity date as of the date the Corporation is applying the procedures in this Section 3(b) and such series shall become the Covered Debt on the related Redesignation Date; (iv) the series of outstanding long-term indebtedness for money borrowed that is determined to be Covered Debt pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) above shall be the Covered Debt for purposes of this Replacement Capital Covenant for the period commencing on the related Redesignation Date and continuing to but not including the Redesignation Date as of which a new series of outstanding unsecured, long-term indebtedness is next determined to be the Covered Debt pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 3(b); and (v) in connection with such identification of a new series of Covered Debt, the Corporation shall, as provided for in Section 3(c), give a notice and file with the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K under the Securities Exchange Act including or incorporating by 2
reference this Replacement Capital Covenant as an exhibit within the time frame provided for in such section. (c) Notice. In order to give effect to the intent of the Corporation described in Recital C, the Corporation covenants that (i) simultaneously with the execution of this Replacement Capital Covenant or as soon as practicable after the date hereof, it shall (x) give notice to the Holders of the Initial Covered Debt, in the manner provided in the indenture relating to the Initial Covered Debt, of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the rights granted to such Holders hereunder and (y) file a copy of this Replacement Capital Covenant with the Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K under the Securities Exchange Act; (ii) so long as the Corporation is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, the Corporation will include in each Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act a description of the covenant set forth in Section 2 and identify the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money that is Covered Debt as of the date such Form 10-K is filed with the Commission; (iii) if a series of the Corporation's long-term indebtedness for money borrowed (1) becomes Covered Debt or (2) ceases to be Covered Debt, the Corporation will give notice of such occurrence within 30 days to the holders of such long-term indebtedness for money borrowed in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument under which such long-term indebtedness for money borrowed was issued and report such change in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which must include or and incorporate by reference this Replacement Capital Covenant, and in the Corporation's next Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as applicable; (iv) if, and only if, the Corporation ceases to be a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, the Corporation will post on its website the information otherwise required to be included in Securities Exchange Act filings pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3(c); and (v) promptly upon request by any Holder of Covered Debt, the Corporation will provide such Holder with an executed copy of this Replacement Capital Covenant. SECTION 4. Termination, Amendment and Waiver. (a) The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the "Termination Date") to occur of (i) March 15, 2067, (ii) the date, if any, on which the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding principal amount of the then-effective series of Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the obligations of the Corporation hereunder and (iii) the date on which the Corporation ceases to have any series of outstanding Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (b) of the definition of each such term). Moreover, if an event of default under the Supplemental Indenture resulting in an acceleration of the Debentures occurs, this Replacement Capital Covenant shall, without any further action, immediately terminate upon such acceleration. From and after the Termination Date, the obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be of no further force and effect. (b) This Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed by the Corporation with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding principal amount of the then-effective series of Covered Debt, provided that this Replacement Capital Covenant may be amended or supplemented from time to time by a written instrument signed only by the Corporation (and without the consent of the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt) if any of the following apply (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement may fall into one or more of the following): (i) the effect of such amendment or supplement is solely to impose additional restrictions on, or eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or 3
other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate to that effect, (ii) such amendment or supplement is not materially adverse to the rights of the Covered Debtholders hereunder and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not materially adverse to the Covered Debtholders, or (iii) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities if, in the case of this clause (iii), the Corporation has been advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to do so would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated for financial reporting purposes. (c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective. SECTION 5. Miscellaneous. (a) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. (b) This Replacement Capital Covenant shall be binding upon the Corporation and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Covered Debtholders as they exist from time-to-time (it being understood and agreed by the Corporation that any Person who is a Covered Debtholder at the time such Person acquires, holds or sells Covered Debt shall retain its status as a Covered Debtholder for so long as the series of long-term indebtedness for borrowed money owned by such Person is Covered Debt and, if such Person initiates a claim or proceeding to enforce its rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant after the Corporation has violated its covenants in Section 2 and before the series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed held by such Person is no longer Covered Debt, such Person's rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall not terminate by reason of such series of long-term indebtedness for money borrowed no longer being Covered Debt). Other than the Covered Debtholders as provided in the previous sentence, no other Person shall have any rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant or be deemed a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant. In particular, no holder of the Debentures is a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant, it being understood that such holders may have rights under the Subordinated Indenture. (c) All demands, notices, requests and other communications to the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if in writing and (i) if served by personal delivery upon the Corporation, on the day so delivered (or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) or (ii) if delivered by registered post or certified mail, return receipt requested, or sent to the Corporation by a national or international courier service, on the date of receipt by the Corporation (or, if such date of receipt is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day), and in each case to the Corporation at the address set forth below, or at such other address as the Corporation may thereafter notify to Covered Debtholders or post on its website as the address for notices under this Replacement Capital Covenant: American International Group, Inc. 70 Pine Street New York, New York 10270 Attention: Secretary 4
