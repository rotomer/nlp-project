States of a national emergency or war, other than any such outbreak, escalation or declaration arising out of or relating to the U.S. war on terrorism that does not represent a significant departure from the conditions that exist at the date hereof, if the effect of any such event in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; (iv) the suspension of trading in the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share, on the New York Stock Exchange, if the effect of such event in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a); or (v) any downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's senior debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, or Standard & Poor's, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., if the effect of such event in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a). 9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and provided, further, that the foregoing indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a), with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, where (i) prior to the Applicable Time the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in a further amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free -11-
Writing Prospectus, and such corrected Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter prior to the Applicable Time, (iii) such corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the contract for sale of the Securities to such person and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above. (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such -12-
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for -13-
themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriters, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "UNDERWRITER" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. -14-
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriters except as provided in Section 9 hereof. 13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly. All statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Underwriter, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail as set forth in Schedule I hereto under such Underwriter's name, and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to 70 Pine Street, New York, New York 10270, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 785-1584, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect (other than services rendered by any of the Underwriters in its role as a joint structuring advisor), or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 17. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 18. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement. -15-
19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. -16-
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by each of you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and each of you in accordance with its terms.

SCHEDULE III Form of Opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March __, 2007 (the "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "UNDERWRITERS"), of (pounds)__________ aggregate principal amount of the Company's _____% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "SECURITIES") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of March __, 2007, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated March __, 2007 (together, the "INDENTURE"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "TRUSTEE"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that: (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. (2) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, III-1
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. (3) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. In connection with the opinion in paragraph (2), we note that, as of the date of this opinion, a judgment for money in an action based on the Securities in a Federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of Sterling into United States dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. Under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a state court in the State of New York rendering a judgment on a Security would be required to render such judgment in Sterling, and such judgment would be converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we express no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We have also relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the specimen thereof examined by us, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified. Very truly yours, ---------------------------------------- III-2
FORM OF LETTER OF SULLIVAN & CROMWELL LLP March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of (pounds)__________ aggregate principal amount of _____% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") of American International Group, Inc. (the "Company"). The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed on different dates on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Commission on July 24, 2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates. III-3
As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, as of the effective date of Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of [__:00] [A/P].M. on March __, 2007 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), [when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement,] contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or III-4
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this paragraph has caused us to believe that (a) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, [when considered together with any other disclosures added in the Prospectus Supplement,] as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures", "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued or the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Securities, or insofar as they relate to provisions of U.S. Federal tax law therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statements, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued.

SCHEDULE IV FORM OF OPINION OF KATHLEEN E. SHANNON March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company. This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of (pounds)__________ aggregate principal amount of the Company's _____% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of March __, 2007, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated March __, 2007 (together, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") on different dates on Form S-3. The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 24, 2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered IV-1
by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, you are advised that, in my opinion: (i) The Company has authorized capital as incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus. (ii) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as exhibits thereto, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed. (iii) The issue and sale of the Securities, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental body applicable to the Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not have a IV-2
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities and as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. (iv) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of __:00 [A/P].M. on March __, 2007 (the "Applicable Time") (which you have informed me is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or IV-3
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. In connection with the opinion in paragraph (ii), I note that, as of the date of this opinion, a judgment for money in an action based on the Securities in a Federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of Sterling into United States dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. Under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a state court in the State of New York rendering a judgment on a Security would be required to render such judgment in Sterling, and such judgment would be converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. In rendering the opinion in paragraph (iv), (A) I assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities and the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued therein described, and (B) I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from IV-4
accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued. In rendering the opinion in paragraph (v), I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement. This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

The consolidated financial statements, financial statement schedules and management's assessment referred to above are all incorporated by reference in the registration statement (No. 333-106040) on Form S-3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"); our report (which contains an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting) with respect to the audits referred to above is also incorporated by reference in such registration statement. Such registration statement of which the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 forms a part, is supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated March __, 2007 for the offering of (pounds)__________ of _____% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures. Such registration statement is herein referred to as the "Registration Statement." In connection with the Registration Statement: V-1
1. We are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"). 2. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules audited by us and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. 3. We have not audited any financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2006.

Also, we have not audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of any date subsequent to December 31, 2006. Therefore, we do not express any opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of any date subsequent to December 31, 2006. 4. For purposes of this letter, we have read the minutes of the 2006 and 2007 meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and Committees of the Board of Directors of the Company as set forth in the minute books at March 1, 2007, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein, except for the minutes of the meetings listed below which were not approved in final form, for which agendas were provided to us; officials of the Company have represented that such agendas include all substantive actions taken at such meetings: i) the Board of Directors of AIG (the "Board"), January 17, 2007 and February 27, 2007 meetings; ii) the Audit Committee of the Board, February 14, 2007 and February 27, 2007 meetings; iii) the Compensation Committee of the Board, December 11, 2006 meeting; iv) the Finance Committee of the Board, February 15, 2007 meeting; v) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, January 16, 2007 meeting; vi) the Public Policy and Social Responsibility Committee of the Board, January 16, 2007 meeting; V-2

Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2006 are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after December 31, 2006 have, of necessity, been limited. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at March 1, 2007 there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or decrease in consolidated shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; or (b) for the period from January 1, 2007 to March 1, 2007, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net income. Those officials referred to above stated that due to the fact that there is no consolidated financial data available subsequent to December 31, 2006, they are not in a position to comment on whether there was any such change, increase or decrease. 6. This letter is solely for the information of the addressees and to assist the underwriters in conducting and documenting their investigation of the affairs of the Company in connection with the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement, and is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, including but not limited to the registration, purchase, or sale of securities, nor is it to be filed with or referred to in whole or in part in the Registration Statement or any other document, except that reference may be made to it in the underwriting agreement or in any list of closing documents pertaining to the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement.

The Company covenants and agrees with each of the Underwriters: (a) To prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the date of this Agreement; to make no further amendment or supplement (other than an amendment or supplement as a result of filings by the Company under the Exchange Act and other than amendments or supplements in connection with offerings of medium-term notes under any medium-term note program existing on the date of this Agreement) to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus prior to the Time of Delivery which shall be disapproved by the Representatives promptly after reasonable notice thereof; between the signing of this Agreement and the Time of Delivery, to give reasonable advance notice to the Representatives of any filings by the Company under the Exchange Act; between the signing of this Agreement and the Time of Delivery, to advise the Representatives promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus has been filed (other than an amendment or supplement as a result of filings by the Company under the Exchange Act and other than amendments or supplements in connection with offerings of medium-term notes under any medium-term note program existing on the date of this Agreement) and to furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, in the form set forth in Exhibit A to Schedule II hereto and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule; to file promptly all other material required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission (other than an amendment or supplement as a result of filings by the Company under the Exchange Act and other than the filing of prospectuses, preliminary prospectuses, preliminary prospectus supplements, issuer free-writing prospectuses and other documents pursuant to Rule 424(b) or Rule 433 under the Act that relate to securities other than the Securities), of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any such prospectus relating to the Securities or suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its withdrawal; -6-
(b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities; provided, however, that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction; (c) From time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time of issuance of the Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered, not misleading, or if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any of the Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon the request of the Representatives but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as the Representatives may request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act; (d) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than sixteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c)), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158); (e) During the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for the Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives, and (ii) the Time of Delivery for the Securities, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than nine months after such Time of Delivery and which are pari passu with, and otherwise substantially similar to, the Securities, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, provided that the foregoing agreement shall not apply to the 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures or the 5.75% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures of the Company; and -7-
(f) To use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, no later than 30 days following the Time of Delivery, the Securities will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 6. (a) The Company and each Underwriter agree that the Underwriters may prepare and use one or more preliminary term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information; provided that such information has been approved by the Company before the first communication containing such information is used; (b) Each Underwriter represents that it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any written communication that constitutes an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Securities other than (A) any written communication permitted under subparagraph (a) above, (B) the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, or (C) any written communication prepared by such Underwriter and approved in writing by the Company in advance; (c) The Company represents to the Underwriters that it has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any written communication that constitutes an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Securities other than (A) any written communication permitted under subparagraph (a) above, (B) the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, (C) a press release or other announcement relating to the Securities that complies with Rule 134 or Rule 135 under the Act and that the Company issues after giving notice to the Representatives of its intent to issue a press release, or (D) any written communication approved by the Representatives in advance in writing; (d) Any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company or the Representatives, as the case may be (including the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof), is listed on Schedule II(a) hereto; (e) The Company represents and agrees that it has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission, where required, and legending; and (f) The Company agrees that if at any time following the issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will, if the Underwriters are then required to deliver a prospectus under the Act in respect of sales of Securities (or, in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173 under the Act), give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. -8-
7. The Underwriters jointly and severally agree to pay or cause to be paid all of the Company's expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, up to an amount equal to 10% of the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities, including without limitation, (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters; (ii) the cost of printing, word-processing or reproducing this Agreement, any Indenture, any Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee and any agent of any Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any Trustee in connection with any Indenture and the Securities; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder and under the Indenture which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. 8. The obligations of the Underwriters shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein shall be true and correct in all material respects, at and as of the Time of Delivery, the condition that the Company shall have performed, in all material respects, all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed and the following additional conditions: (a) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of the Company, shall be contemplated by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representatives; (b) Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion, dated the Time of Delivery, with respect to the Indenture, the validity of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Schedule III hereto; -9-
(d) Kathleen E. Shannon, Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives her opinion, dated the Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Schedule IV hereto; (e) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement and at the Time of Delivery, the independent registered public accounting firm who have audited the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, to the effect set forth in Schedule V hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (f) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package, there shall not have been any Material Adverse Change which, in the judgment of the Representatives, materially impairs the investment quality of the Securities, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; (g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice Chairman, any Executive or Senior Vice President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Time of Delivery, in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, in all material respects, as of the Time of Delivery, that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied, in all material respects, at or prior to the Time of Delivery, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are threatened by the Commission, and that, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package, there has not been any Material Adverse Change, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; and (h) On or after the date hereof, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange if the effect of any such event, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase by the Underwriters of the Securities from the Company; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, other than any such outbreak, escalation or declaration arising out of or relating to the U.S. war on terrorism that does not represent a significant departure from the conditions that exist at the date hereof, if the effect of any such event in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; (iv) the suspension of trading in the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share, on the New York Stock Exchange, if the effect of such event in -10-
the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a); or (v) any downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's senior debt securities by Moody's Investors Service, a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, or Standard & Poor's, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., if the effect of such event in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a). 9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and provided, further, that the foregoing indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a), with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, where (i) prior to the Applicable Time the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in a further amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and such corrected Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter prior to the Applicable Time, (iii) such corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the contract for sale of the Securities to such person and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above. -11-
(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. -12-
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriters, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file -13-
promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "UNDERWRITER" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriters except as provided in Section 9 hereof. 13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly. All statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Underwriter, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail as set forth in Schedule I hereto -14-
under such Underwriter's name, and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to 70 Pine Street, New York, New York 10270, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 785-1584, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect (other than services rendered by any of the Underwriters in its role as a joint structuring advisor), or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 17. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 18. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement. 19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. -15-
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by each of you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and each of you in accordance with its terms.

SCHEDULE III Form of Opinion of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March __, 2007 (the "UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT"), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "UNDERWRITERS"), of (euro)_________ aggregate principal amount of the Company's _____% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "SECURITIES") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of March __, 2007, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated March __, 2007 (together, the "INDENTURE"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "TRUSTEE"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that: (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. (2) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, III-1
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles. (3) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. In connection with the opinion in paragraph (2), we note that, as of the date of this opinion, a judgment for money in an action based on the Securities in a Federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of Euro into United States dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. Under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a state court in the State of New York rendering a judgment on a Security would be required to render such judgment in Euro, and such judgment would be converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we express no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We have also relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the specimen thereof examined by us, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified. Very truly yours, ---------------------------------------- III-2
FORM OF LETTER OF SULLIVAN & CROMWELL LLP March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of (euro)__________ aggregate principal amount of _____% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") of American International Group, Inc. (the "Company"). The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed on different dates on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Commission on July 24, 2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates. III-3
As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, as of the effective date of Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of [__:00] [A/P].M. on March __, 2007 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), [when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement,] contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or III-4
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this paragraph has caused us to believe that (a) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, [when considered together with any other disclosures added in the Prospectus Supplement,] as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures", "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued or the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Securities, or insofar as they relate to provisions of U.S. Federal tax law therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statements, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure III-5
Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued. This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities. Very truly yours, ---------------------------------------- III-6

SCHEDULE IV FORM OF OPINION OF KATHLEEN E. SHANNON March __, 2007 Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd., As Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o [Name], [Address]. Ladies and Gentlemen: I am Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company. This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of (euro)__________ aggregate principal amount of the Company's _____% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of March __, 2007, as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated March __, 2007 (together, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") on different dates on Form S-3. The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 24, 2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered IV-1
by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated March __, 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, you are advised that, in my opinion: (i) The Company has authorized capital as incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus. (ii) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as exhibits thereto, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed. (iii) The issue and sale of the Securities, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental body applicable to the Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not have a Material IV-2
Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities and as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. (iv) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of __:00 [A/P].M. on March __, 2007 (the "Applicable Time") (which you have informed me is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or IV-3
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. In connection with the opinion in paragraph (ii), I note that, as of the date of this opinion, a judgment for money in an action based on the Securities in a Federal or state court in the United States ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in United States dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of Euro into United States dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. Under Section 27 of the New York Judiciary Law, a state court in the State of New York rendering a judgment on a Security would be required to render such judgment in Euro, and such judgment would be converted into United States dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. In rendering the opinion in paragraph (iv), (A) I assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities and the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued therein described, and (B) I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the IV-4
Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued. In rendering the opinion in paragraph (v), I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement. This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

The consolidated financial statements, financial statement schedules and management's assessment referred to above are all incorporated by reference in the registration statement (No. 333-106040) on Form S-3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"); our report (which contains an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting) with respect to the audits referred to above is also incorporated by reference in such registration statement. Such registration statement of which the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 forms a part, is supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated March __, 2007 for the offering of (euro)__________ of _____% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures. Such registration statement is herein referred to as the "Registration Statement." In connection with the Registration Statement: V-1
1. We are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"). 2. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules audited by us and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC. 3. We have not audited any financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2006. Therefore, we are unable to and do not express any opinion on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2006. Also, we have not audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of any date subsequent to December 31, 2006. Therefore, we do not express any opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of any date subsequent to December 31, 2006. 4. For purposes of this letter, we have read the minutes of the 2006 and 2007 meetings of the stockholders, the Board of Directors and Committees of the Board of Directors of the Company as set forth in the minute books at March 1, 2007, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein, except for the minutes of the meetings listed below which were not approved in final form, for which agendas were provided to us; officials of the Company have represented that such agendas include all substantive actions taken at such meetings: i) the Board of Directors of AIG (the "Board"), January 17, 2007 and February 27, 2007 meetings; ii) the Audit Committee of the Board, February 14, 2007 and February 27, 2007 meetings; iii) the Compensation Committee of the Board, December 11, 2006 meeting; iv) the Finance Committee of the Board, February 15, 2007 meeting; v) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board, January 16, 2007 meeting; vi) the Public Policy and Social Responsibility Committee of the Board, January 16, 2007 meeting; V-2
vii) the Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Committee of the Board, January 17, 2007 meeting. We have carried out other procedures to March 1, 2007 (our work did not extend to the period from March 2, 2007 to March __, 2007, inclusive) as follows. 5. Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 31, 2006 are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after December 31, 2006 have, of necessity, been limited. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether (a) at March 1, 2007 there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or decrease in consolidated shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with amounts shown in the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; or (b) for the period from January 1, 2007 to March 1, 2007, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net income. Those officials referred to above stated that due to the fact that there is no consolidated financial data available subsequent to December 31, 2006, they are not in a position to comment on whether there was any such change, increase or decrease. 6. This letter is solely for the information of the addressees and to assist the underwriters in conducting and documenting their investigation of the affairs of the Company in connection with the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement, and is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, including but not limited to the registration, purchase, or sale of securities, nor is it to be filed with or referred to in whole or in part in the Registration Statement or any other document, except that reference may be made to it in the underwriting agreement or in any list of closing documents pertaining to the offering of the securities covered by the Registration Statement.

(e) Rate of Interest. The Debentures shall bear interest (i) from and including March 15, 2007 to but excluding March 15, 2017 at the rate of 5.75% per annum, computed on the basis of the number of days from and including the date on which interest begins to accrue during the relevant Interest Period to but excluding the scheduled date on which such interest is payable, divided by the number of days in the relevant Interest Period (including the first day but excluding the last day of such Interest Period), and (ii) beginning on and including March 15, 2017, at an annual rate equal to Three-month Sterling LIBOR plus 1.705%, computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. All percentages resulting from any calculation of Three-month Sterling LIBOR will be rounded upward or downward, as appropriate, to the next higher or lower one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point. Subject to Sections 2.1(g) and (h): (x) prior to and including March 15, 2017, interest on the Debentures shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2007 (each such date, a "Semi-annual Interest Payment Date"), and (y) after March 15, 2017, interest on the Debentures shall be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2017, or if any such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, unless such postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month, in which case it shall be brought forward to the preceding Business Day (each such date, a "Quarterly Interest Payment Date"). In the event any Semi-annual Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on that date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue as a result of such postponement. Any installment of interest (or portion thereof) deferred in accordance with Section 2.1(g) or otherwise unpaid shall bear additional interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the rate of interest then in effect from time to time on the Debentures, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date, until paid in accordance with Section 2.1(h). (f) To Whom Interest is Payable. Interest (other than deferred interest which shall be payable to the Persons specified pursuant to Section 2.1(g)(ii)) shall be payable to the Person in whose name the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date, or in the event the Debentures cease to be held in the form of one or more Global Securities, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to that Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day. (g) Option to Defer Interest Payments. (i) The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time prior to the Final Maturity Date, to defer the payment of interest on the -15-
Debentures for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed 10 years; provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the earlier redemption of the Debentures. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or the Company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary, subject to the exceptions specified in clause (vii) of this Section 2.1(g), to: (a) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any Capital Stock of the Company, (b) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures or (c) make any payments with respect to any Guarantee by the Company of the junior subordinated debt securities of any Subsidiary if such Guarantee ranks pari passu with, or junior in interest to, the Debentures. (ii) At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest on the Debentures (together with compounded interest thereon, if any, to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the Person in whose name the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period or, in the event the Debentures cease to be held in the form of one or more Global Securities, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to the end of the Deferral Period, whether or not a Business Day. (iii) Upon termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest and any compounded interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.1(g). (iv) The Company may elect to pay deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted by Section 2.1(h). (v) The Company shall give written notice to the Trustee and the Holders of the Debentures of its election to begin any Deferral Period at least one Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date for that Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Company's failure to pay any interest due within five Business Days after any Interest Payment Date shall automatically and without any further action by any Person be deemed to commence a Deferral Period. (vi) If any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities ranking junior to or pari passu with any APM Qualifying -16-
Securities the proceeds of which were used to pay deferred interest during such Deferral Period until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest has been paid, subject to the exceptions set forth in clause (vii) below. If the Company is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination more than 50% of the surviving or resulting entity's Voting Stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the Business Combination or Continuing Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors of the surviving or resulting entity, then neither the restrictions set forth in this clause (vi) nor the provisions of Section 2.1(h) shall apply to any Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of the Business Combination. (vii) The restrictions in clauses (i) and (vi) of this Section 2.1(g) do not apply to (a) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with (1) any Employee Benefit Plan or the Assurance Agreement or (2) a dividend reinvestment, stock purchase plan or other similar plan, (b) any exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock (or the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary) for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock or of any class or series of Indebtedness of the Company for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock, (c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Capital Stock of the Company in accordance with the conversion or exchange provisions of the Company's Capital Stock or the security or instrument being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' right plan, or the issuance of rights, equity securities or other property under any stockholders' right plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights in accordance with any stockholders' rights plan, (e) any dividend in the form of equity securities, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks pari passu with or junior to such equity securities, (f) any payment during a Deferral Period of current interest in respect of any debt securities of the Company that rank pari passu with the Debentures that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such pari passu securities and on the Debentures and any payments of deferred interest on such pari passu securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such pari passu securities (provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.1(h) to the extent it applies), (g) any payment of principal in respect of pari passu securities having an earlier scheduled maturity date than the Debentures, as required under a provision of such pari passu securities that is substantially the same as Section 2.1(d) or any such payment in respect of any such pari passu securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of such securities and the Debentures or (h) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing that security. -17-
(h) Payment of Deferred Interest. The Company shall not pay deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) on the Debentures on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period from any source other than Eligible APM Proceeds unless (x) required by an applicable regulatory authority, (y) permitted under clause (vi) of Section 2.1(g) or (z) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may pay current interest during a Deferral Period from any available funds. To the extent that the Company is able to raise some, but not all, Eligible APM Proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date, such Eligible APM Proceeds shall be allocated first to deferred payments of accrued and unpaid interest in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred. If any Indebtedness of the Company that ranks pari passu with the Debentures is outstanding in addition to the Debentures under which the Company is obligated to sell APM Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of Eligible APM Proceeds received by the Company from such sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions shall be applied to the Debentures and such pari passu securities on a pro rata basis up to, in the case of Common Stock, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap and the Maximum Share Number, in the case of Qualifying Warrants, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap and the Maximum Warrant Number and, in the case of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing such pari passu securities) in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such pari passu securities. The Company may make such pro rata payments on such pari passu securities so long as it shall have paid or deposited with the paying agent for the Debentures or shall have segregated and holds in trust for payment the pro rata proceeds applicable to the Debentures that have not been paid. The "Maximum Share Number" will initially equal 100,000,000 and the "Maximum Warrant Number" will initially equal 100,000,000; provided that, if the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Maximum Share Number and the Maximum Warrant Number shall be correspondingly adjusted in a manner reasonably determined by the Company. The Company may, at its discretion and without the consent of the holders of the Debentures, increase the Maximum Share Number or the Maximum Warrant Number or both (including through the increase of the Company's authorized share capital, if necessary) if the Company determines that such increase is necessary to allow the Company to issue sufficient Common Stock and/or Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest on the Debentures. (i) Alternative Payment Mechanism. Immediately following any APM Commencement Date and until the termination of the related Deferral Period, the Company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell APM Qualifying Securities until the Company has raised an amount of Eligible APM Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures -18-
(including compounded interest thereon) and applied such Eligible APM Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) in accordance with Section 2.1(h); provided that: (1) the foregoing obligations shall not apply (i) during the first five years of any Deferral Period to the extent the number of shares of Common Stock issued and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Qualifying Warrants, together with the number of shares of Common Stock previously issued and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period to pay interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.1(i), would, in the aggregate, exceed 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements on the date of determination (the "Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap") or (ii) to the issuance of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock at any time to the extent the Eligible APM Proceeds raised from such issuance, together with the Eligible APM Proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(i) applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, would exceed (pounds)187,500,000 plus 25% of the aggregate principal amount of any additional Debentures at the time of their initial issuance pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (the "Preferred Stock Issuance Cap"); (2) the foregoing obligations shall not apply in respect of any Interest Payment Date if the Company shall have provided to the Trustee (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of the Debentures whose name appears in the Security Register) no more than 30 and no less than 10 Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event occurred after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (A) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of such period but the Company was unable after commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible APM Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest due on the Interest Payment Date with respect to which such Officers' Certificate is being delivered; and (3) to the extent that the Company has raised some but not all Eligible APM Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date, such Eligible APM Proceeds shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.1(h). Once the Company reaches the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Company will not be required to issue more shares of Common Stock or -19-
Qualifying Warrants under this Section 2.1(i) during the first five years of such Deferral Period even if the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap will cease to apply after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Deferral Period, at which point the Company must pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred pursuant to Section 2.1(h), subject to the limitations in Section 2.1(g), the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, the Maximum Share Number, the Maximum Warrant Number and any Market Disruption Event. In addition, if the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Company subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap will cease to apply at the termination of such Deferral Period, reset to zero and will not apply again unless and until the start of a new Deferral Period. The Preferred Stock Issuance Cap shall not reset to zero even if the Company pays all deferred interest for a Deferral Period, and the Eligible APM Proceeds from sales of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock applied pursuant to Section 2.1(h) during such Deferral Period and all prior Deferral Periods cumulate as Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock is issued to pay deferred interest. The Company will not be excused from its obligations under this Section 2.1(i) if it determines not to pursue or complete the sale of APM Qualifying Securities due to pricing, dividend rate or dilution considerations. (j) Events of Default. The Debentures shall not be entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default in clauses (1) through (4) of Section 501 of the Indenture. The Debentures shall be entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default in clauses (5) and (6) of Section 501 of the Indenture. The following events shall be Events of Default with respect to the Debentures (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article Fourteen of the Indenture or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of interest, including compounded interest, in full on any Debenture for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of a 10-year period following the commencement of any Deferral Period; (2) default in the payment of the principal of the Debentures at the Final Maturity Date or upon a call for redemption; Except as provided in this paragraph (j), no breach or default by the Company of any other covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Debentures shall constitute an Event of Default. (k) Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission of Amendment. The remedies provided to the Trustee and Holders by Section 502 of the Indenture will apply only to an Event of Default under clause (1) of Section 2.1(j). If an Event of Default specified in -20-
Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture occurs, then in every such case the principal amount of all the Debentures shall automatically become due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. An Event of Default in clause (2) of Section 2.1(j) shall not entitle the Holders to the benefits of Section 502 of the Indenture. (l) Collection of Indebtedness and Suits From Enforcement by Trustee. The Debentures shall not have the benefits of the first paragraph of Section 503 of the Indenture. (m) Limitation on Suits. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 507 of the Indenture is hereby amended (i) by adding "or Enforcement Event" after "Event of Default" in clause (1) thereof, and (ii) by adding at the end of clause (2) thereof: "or the Holders of no less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Enforcement Event in its own name as Trustee hereunder;". (n) Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 508 of the Indenture is hereby amended and restated in its entirety: "Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture or the Second Supplemental Indenture, the Holder of any Debenture shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 2.1(g)(ii) of the Second Supplemental Indenture and Section 307 of the Indenture) interest on such Debenture when due, it being understood (i) that, in the case of a Deferral Period, interest shall only become due and payable at the time and in the manner provided for in Sections 2.1(g) and (h) of the Second Supplemental Indenture, and interest shall, in the case of Section 2.1(i) of the Second Supplemental Indenture, only become due and payable in the amount determined in accordance with such Section, and (ii) that the extent to which Holders have a right to receive payment of principal on any Repayment Date is determined in accordance with Section 2.1(d) of the Second Supplemental Indenture. Any Holder's right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights referred to in this Section 508 shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder." For the purposes of Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, it is understood and agreed that no payment of principal or interest shall be deemed due and payable under the provisions of Sections 2.1(d), 2.1(g)(ii) and 2.1(h) until the Company has received Eligible Repayment Proceeds or Eligible APM Proceeds, respectively, to pay such principal or interest. (o) Waiver of Past Defaults. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 513 of the Indenture, for the purposes of the Debentures, a past default that is an Event of Default under Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture cannot be waived, with -21-
respect to the Debentures and its consequences, without the consent of each Holder of the Debentures. (p) Notice of Defaults and Enforcement Events. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 602 of the Indenture is hereby amended (i) by adding "and Enforcement Events" after "Defaults" in the header thereof, and (ii) by adding "or Enforcement Event" after "default" in the first and second line of such Section. (q) Redemption. The Debentures shall be redeemable in accordance with Article Eleven of the Indenture, provided that the Debentures are redeemable at any time (i) in whole but not in part at the option of the Company prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event or a Tax Event, (iii) in whole or in part at the option of the Company on any Interest Payment Date on or after March 15, 2017, or (iv) in whole but not in part, at any time at the option of the Company, if the Company becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 2.1(r), other than as a result of an event that would, upon receipt of the required opinion of counsel, constitute a Tax Event, at a "Redemption Price" equal to (1) 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date or (2) in the case of any such redemption prior to March 15, 2017 pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, if greater, the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. For purposes of the Debentures, the first sentence of Section 1104 of the Indenture is replaced in its entirety with the following: "Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register". For purposes of the Debentures, the following is inserted in Section 1103 after "as" and before "the Trustee": "may be required by any national securities exchange on which the Debentures may be listed, or, if not listed,". (r) Additional Amounts. The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") on the Debentures, including payment of principal of and interest, with respect to any Beneficial Owner of the Debentures that is a Non-U.S. Person to ensure that each Net Payment by the Company or any Paying Agent to that Non-U.S. Person on the Debentures will not be less, due to the payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount otherwise then due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's foregoing obligations to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply: (i) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Beneficial Owner: A) having, having had or being considered as having had a relationship with the U.S. as a citizen or resident or otherwise; -22-
B) being treated as present in, or engaged in, or being treated as having been present in or engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. or having or having had a permanent establishment in the U.S.; C) being or having been a personal holding company, a foreign private foundation or other foreign tax-exempt organization, a passive foreign investment company, a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the U.S., or a corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; D) owning or having owned, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Company's Capital Stock that is entitled to vote; or E) being a bank (i) purchasing Debentures in the ordinary course of its lending business or (ii) that is neither (A) buying the Debentures for investment purposes only nor (B) buying the Debentures for resale to a third party that either is not a bank or holding the Debentures for investment purposes only. (ii) to any holder that is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability company, another fiscally transparent entity or that is not the sole Beneficial Owner of the Debentures or any portion of the Debentures, but only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor in relation to the fiduciary, or a Beneficial Owner, partner or a member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had such beneficiary, settlor, Beneficial Owner, partner, or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment; (iii) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Beneficial Owner or any other Person to comply with applicable certification, identification, documentation or other information reporting requirements, if compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the U.S. or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the U.S. is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (iv) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is collected or imposed by any method other than by withholding by the Company or a Paying Agent from a payment on such Debentures; (v) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the presentation by the Beneficial Owner of a Debenture for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; -23-
(vi) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment, withholding, deduction or other governmental charge; (vii) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge any withholding agent (within the meaning of the applicable rules) must withhold from any payment of principal of or interest on any Debentures, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other withholding agent; (viii) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, any such Directive; (ix) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any combination of the above clauses (i) through (viii) of this Section 2.1(r). Except as provided in this Section 2.1(r), the Company shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority. (s) Replacement Capital Covenant. The Company shall not modify the Replacement Capital Covenant to (A) amend the definitions incorporated into this Second Supplemental Indenture pursuant to Section 1.2.3(b) in a manner adverse to the Holders or (B) impose additional restrictions on the type or amount of Qualifying Capital Securities that the Company may include for purposes of determining the extent to which repayment, redemption, defeasance or repurchase of the Debentures is permitted, except with the consent of the holders of a majority of the principal amount of Outstanding Debentures. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, the Company may modify the Replacement Capital Covenant at any time and in any manner without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures. (t) Limitation on Claims in the Event of Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Receivership. To the extent permitted by law, each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur prior to the redemption, repayment or defeasance of such Debentures, such Holder shall only have a claim for deferred and unpaid interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent such interest (including compounded interest thereon) relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not so been paid. (u) Sinking Fund; Holder Repurchase Right. The Debentures shall not be subject to any sinking fund or analogous provision or be redeemable at the option of the Holders. -24-
(v) Forms. The Debentures shall be substantially in the form of Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer executing the same. (w) Subordination. The Debentures shall be subject to Article XIV of the Indenture, subject to the following modifications: (i) For purposes of the Debentures, the "or" before clause (iii) of the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture is deleted, the following clauses are added to the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture after the word "contracts," in clause (iii) for purposes of the Debentures: ", (iv) any subordinated or junior subordinated debt that by its terms is not expressly pari passu or subordinated to the Debentures, (v) any Guarantee of any indebtedness, obligation or security issued by any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company and such Person is viewed by the Company as a vehicle to finance its operations, and (vi) Indebtedness of the Company to its Subsidiaries"; and (ii) For purposes of the Debentures, the following provision is added to the end of the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture after the word "Securities": "provided that (a) trade account payables and accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business, (b) the Company's 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures and 4.875% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures and (c) any other indebtedness, Guarantee or other obligation that is specifically designated as being subordinate, or not superior, in right of payment to the Debentures, shall not be considered Senior Debt". (iii) For purposes of the Debentures, the provisions of Section 1404 of the Indenture shall only apply in the case where (A) there has been an event of default with respect to Senior Debt within the meaning of clause (i) of the definition of Senior Debt, (B) the principal amount of such Senior Debt has been accelerated, (C) the outstanding principal amount of Senior Debt at the time of acceleration is at least $100,000,000 and (D) the event of default or acceleration has not been cured, waived, or otherwise ceased to exist. In no other case and to no other Senior Debt shall Section 1404 apply. (iv) The Debentures shall rank pari passu with the Company's 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures and 4.875% Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures. (x) Registrar, Paying Agent, Authenticating Agent and Place of Payment. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as Security Registrar, Authenticating Agent and Paying Agent with respect to the Debentures. The Debentures may be surrendered for registration of transfer and for exchange at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose in the City of New York, New York and at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose. The Place of Payment for the Debentures shall be the Paying Agent's office in New York, New York. -25-
(y) Defeasance. Until March 15, 2017, the Debentures will be subject to Sections 1302 and 1303 of the Indenture except that all references to U.S. Government Obligations shall be replaced by "United Kingdom Obligations". ARTICLE THREE REPAYMENT OF THE DEBENTURES 3.1. REPAYMENT. The Company shall, not more than 30 nor less than 10 Business Days prior to each Repayment Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of the principal amount of Debentures to be repaid on such date pursuant to Section 2.1(d). 3.2. SELECTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REPAID. If less than all the Debentures are to be repaid on any Repayment Date, the particular Debentures to be repaid shall be selected not more than 30 days prior to such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures not previously repaid or redeemed or as to which notice of repayment or redemption has been given, by such other method as the Trustee may deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for repayment of a portion of the principal amount of any Debenture, provided that the portion of the principal amount of any Debenture not repaid shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination). The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debentures selected for partial repayment and the principal amount thereof to be repaid. For all purposes hereof, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the repayment of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debenture repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debenture which has been or is to be repaid. 3.3. NOTICE OF REPAYMENT. Notice of repayment shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than the 15th calendar day, and not earlier than the 10th calendar day, prior to the Repayment Date, to each Holder of Debentures to be repaid, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register.

ANNEX A THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF. THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE. AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. Registered No. ISIN: L CUSIP No.: American International Group, Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to The Bank of New York Depository (Nominees) Limited, or registered assigns, the principal sum of pounds Sterling ( ) on March 15, 2067, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Final Maturity Date"); provided that the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, this Security shall be payable in full on March 15, 2037, or if such day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date"), or any subsequent Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to the extent set forth in the Indenture hereinafter referred to. As provided in the Indenture, the principal of this Security is payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date only to the extent the Company has raised sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds. The Company's obligation to raise Eligible Repayment Proceeds is subject to certain limitations and restrictions described in the Second Supplemental Indenture hereinafter referred to. In connection with the issuance of this Security, the Company has entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant that contains restrictions on the Company's ability to repay the principal of this Security. This Security shall bear interest (i) from and including March 15, 2007 to but excluding March 15, 2017 at the rate of 5.75% per annum semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing September 15, 2007 (computed on the basis of the number of days from and including the date on which interest begins to accrue during the relevant Interest Period to but excluding the scheduled date on which such interest is payable, divided by the number of days in the relevant Interest Period (including the first day but excluding the last day of such Interest Period)), and (ii) from and including March 15, 2017, at an annual rate equal to Three-month Sterling LIBOR (as defined in the Indenture) plus 1.705% (computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed), payable (subject to deferral as set forth herein and in the Indenture) quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 in each year, commencing June 15, 2017, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment (each such date referred to in clause (i) or (ii), an "Interest
Payment Date"). In the event that any Interest Payment Date on or before March 15, 2017 would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on that date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue as a result of that postponement. In the event that any Interest Payment Date after March 15, 2017 would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, that Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day; however, if the postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will instead be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. Any installment of interest (or portion thereof) deferred in accordance with the Indenture or otherwise unpaid on the relevant Interest Payment Date shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the rate of interest then in effect on this Security, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date, until paid in accordance with the Indenture. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (ii) a day that is not a London Banking Day. The interest (other than deferred interest) so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered (i) at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date if this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, or (ii) the close of business on the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date if this Security is not issued in the form of a Global Security. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for (other than deferred interest) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Any deferred interest shall be payable to the holder of record of this Security as provided below. The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, prior to the Final Maturity Date to defer the payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed 10 years; provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the earlier redemption of the Securities of this series. As provided in the Indenture, the payment of deferred interest is subject to the Company's ability to raise Eligible APM Proceeds. The Company's obligation to raise Eligible APM Proceeds is subject to certain limitations, restrictions and exceptions described in the Second Supplemental Indenture. A-2
At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest on this Security (together with compounded interest thereon, if any, to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period or, in the event this Security ceases to be held in the form of a Global Security, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to the end of the Deferral Period, whether or not a Business Day. Upon termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest and any compounded interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements and those in the Indenture. The Company may elect to pay deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted, and shall pay deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent required, by the Indenture. To the extent permitted by law, each Holder of this Security, by such Holder's acceptance of this Security agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of this Security, such Holder shall only have a claim for deferred and unpaid interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent such interest (including compounded interest thereon) relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not so been paid. The Company shall give written notice to the Trustee and the Holders of this Security of its election to begin any Deferral Period at least one Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date for that Interest Payment Date, provided, however, that the Company's failure to pay any interest due within five Business Days after any Interest Payment Date shall automatically and without any further action by any Person be deemed to commence a Deferral Period. Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and will be made in Sterling; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. If Sterling is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond its control or Sterling is no longer used by the United Kingdom as its currency, then all payments in respect of this Security will be made in U.S. dollars until Sterling is again available to the Company or so used. The amount payable on any date in Sterling will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for Sterling as determined by the Calculation Agent. Any payment in U.S. dollars as described above will not be deemed a default or Enforcement Event under the Indenture. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. A-3
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. A-4

REVERSE OF SECURITY This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture"), which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument, as supplemented by a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 15, 2007 (herein called the "Second Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), in each case, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the holders of Senior Debt and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to (pounds) 750,000,000 (except for Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration or transfer of, or exchange for, or in lieu of, other Securities pursuant to Section 304, 305, 306, 906, or 1107 of the Base Indenture or Section 3.5 of the Second Supplemental Indenture); provided, however, that the Company may from time to time authenticate and deliver under the Indenture up to (pounds) 750,000,000 additional principal amount of Securities which may accrue interest from a different date than this Security, as may be specified pursuant to Section 301 of the Base Indenture, so long as the company reasonably determines that the additional Securities so authenticated and delivered will be fungible for United States federal income tax purposes. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days' prior notice by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at any time (i) in whole but not in part at the option of the Company prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event or a Tax Event, (iii) in whole or in part at the option of the Company on any Interest Payment Date on or after March 15, 2017 or (iv) in whole but not in part at the option of the Company if the Company becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts, other than as a result of an event that would, upon receipt of the required opinion of counsel pursuant to the definition of Tax Event, constitute a Tax Event, at a "Redemption Price" equal to (1) 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date or (2) in the case of any such redemption prior to March 15, 2017 pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, if greater, the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. In the event of a redemption of this Security in part only a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation thereof. A-6
The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the Second Supplemental Indenture, pay Additional Amounts on this Security with respect to any Beneficial Owner of all or any portion of this Security that is a Non-U.S. Person to ensure that each Net Payment by the Company or Paying Agent on such portion of this Security, including payment of principal and interest, that it beneficially owns will not be less, due to any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge of the U.S. or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, than the amount that would have been payable in respect of such portion of this Security had no withholding been required. For all purposes of this Security, any Additional Amounts that are payable shall be treated as interest on this Security. The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee as his or her attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his or her acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Debt, whether now outstanding or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed, and waives reliance by each such holder of Senior Debt upon said provisions. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security at any time prior to March 15, 2017 upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Securities of this series are entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default described in Section 2.1(j) of the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Enforcement Events as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture. The Holder of this Security and the Trustee shall be entitled to the remedies provided by Section 502 of the Base Indenture only if an Event of Default specified in clause (1) of Section 2.1(j) of the Second Supplemental Indenture shall occur with respect to the Securities of this series. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or Section 501(6) of the Base Indenture shall occur with respect to the Securities of this series, then in every such case the principal amount of all the Securities of this series shall become automatically due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. An Event of Default specified in clause (2) of Section 2.1(j) of the Second Supplemental Indenture shall not entitle the Holders to the benefits of Section 502 of the Base Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of A-7
a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default or Enforcement Event with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% (or, in the case of an Enforcement Event, a majority) in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default or Enforcement Event, as the case may be, as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates to the extent provided by Section 2.1(n) of the Second Supplemental Indenture. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of (pounds) 50,000 and even multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. A-8
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires beneficial interest in, this Security agree that, for United States federal, state and local tax purposes, it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness.

Any payment in U.S. dollars pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) will not be deemed a default or Enforcement Event under the Indenture. (d) Scheduled Maturity Date. (i) The principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, the Outstanding Debentures shall be payable in full on March 15, 2037, or if such day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date"); provided that in the event the Company has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to clause (vi) of this Section 2.1(d) in connection with the Scheduled Maturity Date, (A) the principal amount of Debentures payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date, if any, shall be the principal amount set forth in the notice of repayment accompanying such Officers' Certificate, (B) such specified principal amount of Debentures shall be repaid on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to Article III, and (C) subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.1(d), the remaining Debentures shall remain Outstanding and shall be payable on the immediately succeeding Quarterly Interest Payment Date or such earlier date on which they are redeemed pursuant to Section 2.1(o) or shall become due and payable pursuant to Section 502 of the Indenture or clause (iii) of this Section 2.1(d).

For the purpose of clarity, it is possible that the Company may repay the principal and current interest on a Debenture pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) but still be obligated to pay deferred interest on the Debenture. For the purposes of the definition of "Outstanding" in the Indenture, a Debenture, as to which principal and current interest has been repaid, redeemed or otherwise satisfied by the Company, shall for all purposes of the Indenture and this Third Supplemental Indenture, other than for purposes of Article XI of the Indenture and Section 2.1(d) and Article III of this Third Supplemental Indenture, be deemed Outstanding so long as any deferred interest on such Debenture remains unpaid. (v) Until principal and current interest on all Outstanding Debentures are paid in full, the principal of all Outstanding Debentures is automatically accelerated as provided in Section 2.1(k) or a declaration of acceleration pursuant to Section 502 of the Indenture occurs, the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event: (A) to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds during a 180-day period ending on a date not more than 30 and not less than 10 Business Days prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date to permit repayment of the principal and current interest on all Outstanding Debentures in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date; and (B) if the Company is unable for any reason to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds to permit repayment in full of the principal amount of and current interest on all the Outstanding Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Quarterly Interest Payment Date, to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds to permit repayment of the principal and current interest on all Outstanding Debentures in full on the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 2.1(d). (vi) The Company shall, if it has not raised sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds in connection with any Repayment Date, deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee no more than 30 and no less than 10 Business Days in advance of such Repayment Date stating the amount of Eligible -13-
Repayment Proceeds, if any, raised pursuant to clause (v) above in connection with such Repayment Date. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (vi), unless no principal amount of Debentures is to be repaid on the applicable Repayment Date, shall be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 3.1 setting forth the principal amount of the Debentures to be repaid on such Repayment Date, which amount shall be determined after giving effect to clause (viii) of this Section 2.1(d). (vii) The Company shall be excused from its obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (v) above if such Officers' Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing at any time during the period commencing 180 days prior to the date of such Officers' Certificate or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the period commencing on the immediately preceding Quarterly Interest Payment Date and ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate; and (B) either (1) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-day period or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the period since the most recent Quarterly Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, or (2) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the relevant period, but the Company was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Repayment Proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the Debentures in full. (viii) Payments on the Debentures on any Repayment Date shall be applied, first, to the extent permitted by Section 2.1(i), to deferred interest to the extent of Eligible APM Proceeds raised pursuant to Section 2.1(i), second, to current interest and, third, to the repayment of the principal of Debentures; provided that if the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and repay any outstanding pari passu securities in addition to the Debentures, then on any date and for any period such payments shall be applied to the Debentures and those other pari passu securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures pro rata in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts and none of such payments shall be applied to any other pari passu securities having a later scheduled maturity date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures has been paid in full, except to the extent permitted by clause (vii) of Section 2.1(g) and the first sentence of Section 2.1(h). If the Company has raised less than $5,000,000 of Eligible Repayment Proceeds during the relevant 180-day or three-month period, the Company will not be required to repay any Debentures on the relevant Repayment Date, but it will repay the applicable principal amount of the Debentures on the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date as of which the Company has raised at least $5,000,000 of Eligible Repayment Proceeds. -14-

In the event any Annual Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on that date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue as a result of such postponement. Any installment of interest (or portion thereof) deferred in accordance with Section 2.1(g) or otherwise unpaid shall bear additional interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the rate of interest then in effect from time to time on the Debentures, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date, until paid in accordance with Section 2.1(h).

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or the Company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any -15-

(ii) At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest on the Debentures (together with compounded interest thereon, if any, to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the Person in whose name the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period or, in the event the Debentures cease to be held in the form of one or more Global Securities, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to the end of the Deferral Period, whether or not a Business Day.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Company's failure to pay any interest due within five Business Days after any Interest Payment Date shall automatically and without any further action by any Person be deemed to commence a Deferral Period. (vi) If any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities ranking junior to or pari passu with any APM Qualifying Securities the proceeds of which were used to pay deferred interest during such Deferral Period until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest has been paid, subject to the exceptions set forth in clause (vii) below. If the Company is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination more than 50% of the surviving or resulting entity's Voting Stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to -16-
the Business Combination or Continuing Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors of the surviving or resulting entity, then neither the restrictions set forth in this clause (vi) nor the provisions of Section 2.1(h) shall apply to any Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of the Business Combination. (vii) The restrictions in clauses (i) and (vi) of this Section 2.1(g) do not apply to (a) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with (1) any Employee Benefit Plan or the Assurance Agreement or (2) a dividend reinvestment, stock purchase plan or other similar plan, (b) any exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock (or the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary) for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock or of any class or series of Indebtedness of the Company for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock, (c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Capital Stock of the Company in accordance with the conversion or exchange provisions of the Company's Capital Stock or the security or instrument being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' right plan, or the issuance of rights, equity securities or other property under any stockholders' right plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights in accordance with any stockholders' rights plan, (e) any dividend in the form of equity securities, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks pari passu with or junior to such equity securities, (f) any payment during a Deferral Period of current interest in respect of any debt securities of the Company that rank pari passu with the Debentures that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such pari passu securities and on the Debentures and any payments of deferred interest on such pari passu securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such pari passu securities (provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.1(h) to the extent it applies), (g) any payment of principal in respect of pari passu securities having an earlier scheduled maturity date than the Debentures, as required under a provision of such pari passu securities that is substantially the same as Section 2.1(d) or any such payment in respect of any such pari passu securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of such securities and the Debentures or (h) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing that security. (h) Payment of Deferred Interest. The Company shall not pay deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) on the Debentures on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period from any source other than Eligible APM Proceeds unless (x) required by an applicable regulatory authority, (y) permitted under clause (vi) of Section 2.1(g) or (z) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may pay current interest during a Deferral -17-
Period from any available funds. To the extent that the Company is able to raise some, but not all, Eligible APM Proceeds to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date, such Eligible APM Proceeds shall be allocated first to deferred payments of accrued and unpaid interest in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred. If any Indebtedness of the Company that ranks pari passu with the Debentures is outstanding in addition to the Debentures under which the Company is obligated to sell APM Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of Eligible APM Proceeds received by the Company from such sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions shall be applied to the Debentures and such pari passu securities on a pro rata basis up to, in the case of Common Stock, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap and the Maximum Share Number, in the case of Qualifying Warrants, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap and the Maximum Warrant Number and, in the case of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing such pari passu securities) in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such pari passu securities. The Company may make such pro rata payments on such pari passu securities so long as it shall have paid or deposited with the paying agent for the Debentures or shall have segregated and holds in trust for payment the pro rata proceeds applicable to the Debentures that have not been paid. The "Maximum Share Number" will initially equal 100,000,000 and the "Maximum Warrant Number" will initially equal 100,000,000; provided that, if the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Maximum Share Number and the Maximum Warrant Number shall be correspondingly adjusted in a manner reasonably determined by the Company. The Company may, at its discretion and without the consent of the holders of the Debentures, increase the Maximum Share Number or the Maximum Warrant Number or both (including through the increase of the Company's authorized share capital, if necessary) if the Company determines that such increase is necessary to allow the Company to issue sufficient Common Stock and/or Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest on the Debentures. (i) Alternative Payment Mechanism. Immediately following any APM Commencement Date and until the termination of the related Deferral Period, the Company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell APM Qualifying Securities until the Company has raised an amount of Eligible APM Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures (including compounded interest thereon) and applied such Eligible APM Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) in accordance with Section 2.1(h); provided that: (1) the foregoing obligations shall not apply (i) during the first five years of any Deferral Period to the extent the number of shares of Common Stock -18-
issued and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Qualifying Warrants, together with the number of shares of Common Stock previously issued and the number of shares of Common Stock subject to Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period to pay interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.1(i), would, in the aggregate, exceed 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements on the date of determination (the "Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap") or (ii) to the issuance of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock at any time to the extent the Eligible APM Proceeds raised from such issuance, together with the Eligible APM Proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(i) applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, would exceed (euro)250,000,000 plus 25% of the aggregate principal amount of any additional Debentures at the time of their initial issuance pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (the "Preferred Stock Issuance Cap"); (2) the foregoing obligations shall not apply in respect of any Interest Payment Date if the Company shall have provided to the Trustee (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of the Debentures whose name appears in the Security Register) no more than 30 and no less than 10 Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event occurred after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (A) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of such period but the Company was unable after commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible APM Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid interest due on the Interest Payment Date with respect to which such Officers' Certificate is being delivered; and (3) to the extent that the Company has raised some but not all Eligible APM Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date, such Eligible APM Proceeds shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.1(h). Once the Company reaches the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Company will not be required to issue more shares of Common Stock or Qualifying Warrants under this Section 2.1(i) during the first five years of such Deferral Period even if the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap will cease to apply after the fifth anniversary of the commencement of any Deferral Period, at which point the Company must pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred pursuant to -19-
Section 2.1(h), subject to the limitations in Section 2.1(g), the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, the Maximum Share Number, the Maximum Warrant Number and any Market Disruption Event. In addition, if the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Company subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Stock and Warrant Issuance Cap will cease to apply at the termination of such Deferral Period, reset to zero and will not apply again unless and until the start of a new Deferral Period. The Preferred Stock Issuance Cap shall not reset to zero even if the Company pays all deferred interest for a Deferral Period, and the Eligible APM Proceeds from sales of Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock applied pursuant to Section 2.1(h) during such Deferral Period and all prior Deferral Periods cumulate as Qualifying Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock is issued to pay deferred interest. The Company will not be excused from its obligations under this Section 2.1(i) if it determines not to pursue or complete the sale of APM Qualifying Securities due to pricing, dividend rate or dilution considerations. (j) Events of Default. The Debentures shall not be entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default in clauses (1) through (4) of Section 501 of the Indenture. The Debentures shall be entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default in clauses (5) and (6) of Section 501 of the Indenture. The following events shall be Events of Default with respect to the Debentures (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be occasioned by the provisions of Article Fourteen of the Indenture or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of interest, including compounded interest, in full on any Debenture for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of a 10-year period following the commencement of any Deferral Period; (2) default in the payment of the principal of the Debentures at the Final Maturity Date or upon a call for redemption; Except as provided in this paragraph (j), no breach or default by the Company of any other covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Debentures shall constitute an Event of Default. (k) Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission of Amendment. The remedies provided to the Trustee and Holders by Section 502 of the Indenture will apply only to an Event of Default under clause (1) of Section 2.1(j). If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture occurs, then in every such case the principal amount of all the Debentures shall automatically become due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. An Event of Default in clause (2) of Section 2.1(j) shall not entitle the Holders to the benefits of Section 502 of the Indenture. -20-
(l) Collection of Indebtedness and Suits From Enforcement by Trustee. The Debentures shall not have the benefits of the first paragraph of Section 503 of the Indenture. (m) Limitation on Suits. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 507 of the Indenture is hereby amended (i) by adding "or Enforcement Event" after "Event of Default" in clause (1) thereof, and (ii) by adding at the end of clause (2) thereof: "or the Holders of no less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Enforcement Event in its own name as Trustee hereunder." (n) Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 508 of the Indenture is hereby amended and restated in its entirety: "Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture or the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Holder of any Debenture shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 2.1(g)(ii) of the Third Supplemental Indenture and Section 307 of the Indenture) interest on such Debenture when due, it being understood (i) that, in the case of a Deferral Period, interest shall only become due and payable at the time and in the manner provided for in Sections 2.1(g) and (h) of the Third Supplemental Indenture, and interest shall, in the case of Section 2.1(i) of the Third Supplemental Indenture, only become due and payable in the amount determined in accordance with such Section, and (ii) that the extent to which Holders have a right to receive payment of principal on any Repayment Date is determined in accordance with Section 2.1(d) of the Third Supplemental Indenture. Any Holder's right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights referred to in this Section 508 shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder." For the purposes of Section 316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, it is understood and agreed that no payment of principal or interest shall be deemed due and payable under the provisions of Sections 2.1(d), 2.1(g)(ii) and 2.1(h) until the Company has received Eligible Repayment Proceeds or Eligible APM Proceeds, respectively, to pay such principal or interest. (o) Waiver of Past Defaults. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 513 of the Indenture, for the purposes of the Debentures, a past default that is an Event of Default under Section 501(5) or 501(6) of the Indenture cannot be waived, with respect to the Debentures and its consequences, without the consent of each Holder of the Debentures. (p) Notice of Defaults and Enforcement Events. For purposes of the Debentures, Section 602 of the Indenture is hereby amended (i) by adding "and -21-
Enforcement Events" after "Defaults" in the header thereof, and (ii) by adding "or Enforcement Event" after "default" in the first and second line of such Section. (q) Redemption. The Debentures shall be redeemable in accordance with Article Eleven of the Indenture, provided that the Debentures are redeemable at any time (i) in whole but not in part at the option of the Company prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event or a Tax Event, (iii) in whole or in part at the option of the Company on any Interest Payment Date on or after March 15, 2017, or (iv) in whole but not in part, at any time at the option of the Company, if the Company becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 2.1(r), other than as a result of an event that would, upon receipt of the required opinion of counsel, constitute a Tax Event, at a "Redemption Price" equal to (1) 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date or (2) in the case of any such redemption prior to March 15, 2017 pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, if greater, the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. For purposes of the Debentures, the first sentence of Section 1104 of the Indenture is replaced in its entirety with the following: "Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register." For purposes of the Debentures, the following is inserted in Section 1103 after "as" and before "the Trustee": "may be required by any national securities exchange on which the Debentures may be listed, or, if not listed,". (r) Additional Amounts. The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") on the Debentures, including payment of principal of and interest, with respect to any Beneficial Owner of the Debentures that is a Non-U.S. Person to ensure that each Net Payment by the Company or any Paying Agent to that Non-U.S. Person on the Debentures will not be less, due to the payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount otherwise then due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's foregoing obligations to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply: (i) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Beneficial Owner: A) having, having had or being considered as having had a relationship with the U.S. as a citizen or resident or otherwise; B) being treated as present in, or engaged in, or being treated as having been present in or engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. or having or having had a permanent establishment in the U.S.; -22-

(ii) to any holder that is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability company, another fiscally transparent entity or that is not the sole Beneficial Owner of the Debentures or any portion of the Debentures, but only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor in relation to the fiduciary, or a Beneficial Owner, partner or a member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had such beneficiary, settlor, Beneficial Owner, partner, or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment; (iii) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Beneficial Owner or any other Person to comply with applicable certification, identification, documentation or other information reporting requirements, if compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the U.S. or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the U.S. is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (iv) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is collected or imposed by any method other than by withholding by the Company or a Paying Agent from a payment on such Debentures; (v) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or governmental charge that would not have been so imposed or withheld but for the presentation by the Beneficial Owner of a Debenture for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; (vi) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment, withholding, deduction or other governmental charge; -23-
(vii) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge any withholding agent (within the meaning of the applicable rules) must withhold from any payment of principal of or interest on any Debentures, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other withholding agent; (viii) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, any such Directive; (ix) if a payment on the Debentures is reduced as a result of any combination of the above clauses (i) through (viii) of this Section 2.1(r). Except as provided in this Section 2.1(r), the Company shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority. (s) Replacement Capital Covenant. The Company shall not modify the Replacement Capital Covenant to (A) amend the definitions incorporated into this Third Supplemental Indenture pursuant to Section 1.2.3(b) in a manner adverse to the Holders or (B) impose additional restrictions on the type or amount of Qualifying Capital Securities that the Company may include for purposes of determining the extent to which repayment, redemption, defeasance or repurchase of the Debentures is permitted, except with the consent of the holders of a majority of the principal amount of Outstanding Debentures. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, the Company may modify the Replacement Capital Covenant at any time and in any manner without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures. (t) Limitation on Claims in the Event of Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Receivership. To the extent permitted by law, each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur prior to the redemption, repayment or defeasance of such Debentures, such Holder shall only have a claim for deferred and unpaid interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent such interest (including compounded interest thereon) relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not so been paid. (u) Sinking Fund; Holder Repurchase Right. The Debentures shall not be subject to any sinking fund or analogous provision or be redeemable at the option of the Holders. (v) Forms. The Debentures shall be substantially in the form of Annex A attached hereto, with such modifications thereto as may be approved by the authorized officer executing the same. -24-
(w) Subordination. The Debentures shall be subject to Article XIV of the Indenture, subject to the following modifications: (i) For purposes of the Debentures, the "or" before clause (iii) of the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture is deleted, the following clauses are added to the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture after the word "contracts," in clause (iii) for purposes of the Debentures: ", (iv) any subordinated or junior subordinated debt that by its terms is not expressly pari passu or subordinated to the Debentures, (v) any Guarantee of any indebtedness, obligation or security issued by any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company and such Person is viewed by the Company as a vehicle to finance its operations, and (vi) Indebtedness of the Company to its Subsidiaries"; and (ii) For purposes of the Debentures, the following provision is added to the end of the definition of Senior Debt in the Indenture after the word "Securities": "provided that (a) trade account payables and accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business, (b) the Company's 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures and 5.75% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures and (c) any other indebtedness, Guarantee or other obligation that is specifically designated as being subordinate, or not superior, in right of payment to the Debentures, shall not be considered Senior Debt". (iii) For purposes of the Debentures, the provisions of Section 1404 of the Indenture shall only apply in the case where (A) there has been an event of default with respect to Senior Debt within the meaning of clause (i) of the definition of Senior Debt, (B) the principal amount of such Senior Debt has been accelerated, (C) the outstanding principal amount of Senior Debt at the time of acceleration is at least $100,000,000 and (D) the event of default or acceleration has not been cured, waived, or otherwise ceased to exist. In no other case and to no other Senior Debt shall Section 1404 apply. (iv) The Debentures shall rank pari passu with the Company's 6.25% Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures and 5.75% Series A-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures. (x) Registrar, Paying Agent, Authenticating Agent and Place of Payment. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as Security Registrar, Authenticating Agent and Paying Agent with respect to the Debentures. The Debentures may be surrendered for registration of transfer and for exchange at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose in the City of New York, New York and at any other office or agency maintained by the Company for such purpose. The Place of Payment for the Debentures shall be the Paying Agent's office in New York, New York. (y) Defeasance. Until March 15, 2017, the Debentures will be subject to Sections 1302 and 1303 of the Indenture except that all references to "U.S. Government Obligations" shall be replaced by "Federal Republic of Germany Obligations". -25-
ARTICLE THREE REPAYMENT OF THE DEBENTURES 3.1. REPAYMENT. The Company shall, not more than 30 nor less than 10 Business Days prior to each Repayment Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of the principal amount of Debentures to be repaid on such date pursuant to Section 2.1(d). 3.2. SELECTION OF SECURITIES TO BE REPAID. If less than all the Debentures are to be repaid on any Repayment Date, the particular Debentures to be repaid shall be selected not more than 30 days prior to such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures not previously repaid or redeemed or as to which notice of repayment or redemption has been given, by such other method as the Trustee may deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for repayment of a portion of the principal amount of any Debenture, provided that the portion of the principal amount of any Debenture not repaid shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination). The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debentures selected for partial repayment and the principal amount thereof to be repaid. For all purposes hereof, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the repayment of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debenture repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debenture which has been or is to be repaid. 3.3. NOTICE OF REPAYMENT. Notice of repayment shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than the 15th calendar day, and not earlier than the 10th calendar day, prior to the Repayment Date, to each Holder of Debentures to be repaid, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register. Each notice of repayment shall identify the Debentures to be repaid (including CUSIP number, if a CUSIP number has been assigned to the Debentures) and shall state: (a) the Repayment Date; (b) if less than all Outstanding Debentures are to be repaid, the identification (and, in the case of partial repayment, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Debentures to be repaid; (c) that on the Repayment Date, the principal amount of the Debentures or portions thereof to be repaid will become due and payable, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date; -26-
(d) whether any deferred interest shall remain outstanding on any Debentures to be repaid, and if so, the amount of such deferred interest and that compound interest thereon shall continue to accrue on and after said date until paid; and (e) the place or places where such Debentures are to be surrendered for payment of the principal amount thereof. Notice of repayment shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. 3.4. DEPOSIT OF REPAYMENT AMOUNT. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Repayment Date specified in the notice of repayment given as provided in Section 3.3, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003 of the Indenture) an amount of money sufficient to pay the principal amount of, and (except to the extent the payment of such accrued interest shall be prohibited pursuant to Section 2.1(h)) any accrued interest (including compounded interest) on, all the Debentures which are to be repaid on that date. 3.5. PAYMENT OF DEBENTURES SUBJECT TO REPAYMENT. If any notice of repayment has been given as provided in Section 3.3, the Debentures or portion of the Debentures with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the Repayment Date. On presentation and surrender of such Debentures as provided in the notice of repayment, such Debentures or the specified portions thereof shall be paid by the Company at their principal amount, together with accrued interest (including any compounded interest) to the Repayment Date (except to the extent the payment of such accrued interest shall be prohibited pursuant to Section 2.1(h)); provided that, except in the case of a repayment in full of all Outstanding Debentures, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date will be payable to the Holders of such Debentures, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Regular Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307 of the Indenture and Section 2.1(g)(ii) of this Third Supplemental Indenture. Section 1107 of the Indenture shall apply to any Debenture repaid in part pursuant to this Article III. If any Debenture subject to repayment shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, the principal of such Debenture shall, until paid, bear interest from the applicable Repayment Date at the rate prescribed therefore in the Debenture. -27-

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. Registered No. ISIN: E CUSIP No.: American International Group, Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to The Bank of New York Depository (Nominees) Limited, or registered assigns, the principal sum of euros ( ) on March 15, 2067, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Final Maturity Date"); provided that the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, this Security shall be payable in full on March 15, 2037, or if such day is not a Business Day, the next Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date"), or any subsequent Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to the extent set forth in the Indenture hereinafter referred to.

This Security shall bear interest (i) from and including March 15, 2007 to but excluding March 15, 2017 at the rate of 4.875% per annum annually in arrears on March 15 in each year, commencing March 15, 2008 (computed on the basis of the number of days from and including the date on which interest begins to accrue during the relevant Interest Period to but excluding the scheduled date on which such interest is payable, divided by the number of days in the relevant Interest Period (including the first day but excluding the last day of such Interest Period)), and (ii) from and including March 15, 2017, at an annual rate equal to Three-month EURIBOR (as defined in the Indenture) plus 1.73% (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed), payable (subject to deferral as set forth herein and in the Indenture) quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 in each year, commencing June 15, 2017, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment (each such date referred to in clause (i) or (ii), an "Interest Payment Date"). In
the event that any Interest Payment Date on or before March 15, 2017 would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment due on that date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue as a result of that postponement. In the event that any Interest Payment Date after March 15, 2017 would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, that Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day; however, if the postponement would cause the day to fall in the next calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will instead be brought forward to the immediately preceding Business Day. Any installment of interest (or portion thereof) deferred in accordance with the Indenture or otherwise unpaid on the relevant Interest Payment Date shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the rate of interest then in effect on this Security, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date, until paid in accordance with the Indenture. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (ii) a day that is not a TARGET settlement day. The interest (other than deferred interest) so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered (i) on the day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding the Interest Payment Date if this Security is issued in the form of a Global Security, or (ii) the close of business on the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date if this Security is not issued in the form of a Global Security. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for (other than deferred interest) will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Any deferred interest shall be payable to the holder of record of this Security as provided below. The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, prior to the Final Maturity Date to defer the payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed 10 years; provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date or the earlier redemption of the Securities of this series. As provided in the Indenture, the payment of deferred interest is subject to the Company's ability to raise Eligible APM Proceeds. The Company's obligation to raise Eligible APM Proceeds is subject to certain limitations, restrictions and exceptions described in the Third Supplemental Indenture. A-2
At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest on this Security (together with compounded interest thereon, if any, to the extent permitted by applicable law), to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period or, in the event this Security ceases to be held in the form of a Global Security, at the close of business on the date 15 days prior to the end of the Deferral Period, whether or not a Business Day. Upon termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest and any compounded interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements and those in the Indenture. The Company may elect to pay deferred interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted, and shall pay deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent required, by the Indenture. To the extent permitted by law, each Holder of this Security, by such Holder's acceptance of this Security agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of this Security, such Holder shall only have a claim for deferred and unpaid interest (including compounded interest thereon) to the extent such interest (including compounded interest thereon) relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not so been paid. The Company shall give written notice to the Trustee and the Holders of this Security of its election to begin any Deferral Period at least one Business Day prior to the Regular Record Date for that Interest Payment Date, provided, however, that the Company's failure to pay any interest due within five Business Days after any Interest Payment Date shall automatically and without any further action by any Person be deemed to commence a Deferral Period. Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and will be made in euros; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. If the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond its control or the euro is no longer used by the member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of this Security will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to the Company or so used. The amount payable on any date in euros will be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available market exchange rate for euros as determined by the Calculation Agent. Any payment in U.S. dollars as described above will not be deemed a default or Enforcement Event under the Indenture. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. A-3
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. A-4

REVERSE OF SECURITY This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture"), which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument, as supplemented by a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 15, 2007 (herein called the "Third Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), in each case, between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee, the holders of Senior Debt and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof limited in aggregate principal amount to (euro)1,000,000,000 (except for Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration or transfer of, or exchange for, or in lieu of, other Securities pursuant to Section 304, 305, 306, 906, or 1107 of the Base Indenture or Section 3.5 of the Third Supplemental Indenture); provided, however, that the Company may from time to time authenticate and deliver under the Indenture up to (euro)1,000,000,000 additional principal amount of Securities which may accrue interest from a different date than this Security, as may be specified pursuant to Section 301 of the Base Indenture, so long as the company reasonably determines that the additional Securities so authenticated and delivered will be fungible for United States federal income tax purposes. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days' prior notice by first class mail, postage pre-paid, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at any time (i) in whole but not in part at the option of the Company prior to March 15, 2017, (ii) in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a Rating Agency Event or a Tax Event, (iii) in whole or in part at the option of the Company on any Interest Payment Date on or after March 15, 2017 or (iv) in whole but not in part at the option of the Company if the Company becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts, other than as a result of an event that would, upon receipt of the required opinion of counsel pursuant to the definition of Tax Event, constitute a Tax Event, at a "Redemption Price" equal to (1) 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date or (2) in the case of any such redemption prior to March 15, 2017 pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, if greater, the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. In the event of a redemption of this Security in part only a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation thereof. A-6
The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the Third Supplemental Indenture, pay Additional Amounts on this Security with respect to any Beneficial Owner of all or any portion of this Security that is a Non-U.S. Person to ensure that each Net Payment by the Company or Paying Agent on such portion of this Security , including payment of principal and interest, that it beneficially owns will not be less, due to any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge of the U.S. or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, than the amount that would have been payable in respect of such portion of this Security had no withholding been required. For all purposes of this Security, any Additional Amounts that are payable shall be treated as interest on this Security. The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee as his or her attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his or her acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Debt, whether now outstanding or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or Guaranteed, and waives reliance by each such holder of Senior Debt upon said provisions. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security at any time prior to March 15, 2017 upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Securities of this series are entitled to the benefits of the Events of Default described in Section 2.1(j) of the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Enforcement Events as defined in the Third Supplemental Indenture. The Holder of this Security and the Trustee shall be entitled to the remedies provided by Section 502 of the Base Indenture only if an Event of Default specified in clause (1) of Section 2.1(j) of the Third Supplemental Indenture shall occur with respect to the Securities of this series. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or Section 501(6) of the Base Indenture shall occur with respect to the Securities of this series, then in every such case the principal amount of all the Securities of this series shall become automatically due and payable immediately, without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. An Event of Default specified in clause (2) of Section 2.1(j) of the Third Supplemental Indenture shall not entitle the Holders to the benefits of Section 502 of the Base Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of A-7
a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default or Enforcement Event with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% (or, in the case of an Enforcement Event, a majority) in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default or Enforcement Event, as the case may be, as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates to the extent provided by Section 2.1(n) of the Third Supplemental Indenture. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in fully registered form without coupons in denominations of (euro)50,000 and even multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. A-8
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires beneficial interest in, this Security agree that, for United States federal, state and local tax purposes, it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness. THE BASE INDENTURE, THE THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. A-9

SECTION 4. Termination, Amendment and Waiver. (a) The obligations of the Corporation pursuant to this Replacement Capital Covenant shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest date (the "Termination Date") to occur of (i) March 15, 2047, (ii) the date, if any, on which the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding principal amount of the then-effective series of Covered Debt consent or agree in writing to the termination of this Replacement Capital Covenant and the obligations of the Corporation hereunder and (iii) the date on which the Corporation ceases to have any series of outstanding Eligible Senior Debt or Eligible Subordinated Debt (in each case without giving effect to the rating requirement in clause (b) of the definition of each such term).

other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate to that effect, (ii) such amendment or supplement is not materially adverse to the rights of the Covered Debtholders hereunder and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not materially adverse to the Covered Debtholders, or (iii) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock and/or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock as Replacement Capital Securities if, in the case of this clause (iii), the Corporation has been advised in writing by a nationally recognized independent accounting firm that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to do so would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated for financial reporting purposes. (c) For purposes of Sections 4(a) and 4(b), the Holders whose consent or agreement is required to terminate, amend or supplement the obligations of the Corporation under this Replacement Capital Covenant shall be the Holders of the then-effective Covered Debt as of a record date established by the Corporation that is not more than 30 days prior to the date on which the Corporation proposes that such termination, amendment or supplement becomes effective.

Other than the Covered Debtholders as provided in the previous sentence, no other Person shall have any rights under this Replacement Capital Covenant or be deemed a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant. In particular, no holder of the Debentures is a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant, it being understood that such holders may have rights under the Subordinated Indenture.
