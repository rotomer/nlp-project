          (b) Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel to the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion, dated each Time of Delivery, with respect to the Indenture, the validity of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request (it being understood, however, that in the case of any Optional Time of Delivery, that the opinion shall only cover validity of the Optional Securities), and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
          (c) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Schedule III hereto (it being understood, however, that in the case of any Optional Time of Delivery, that the opinion shall only cover the opinion in paragraph (1) and, with respect to the Optional Securities, the opinion in paragraph (2) set forth in Schedule III hereto);

          (e) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement and the First Time of Delivery, the independent registered public accounting firm who have audited the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, to the effect set forth in Schedule V hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
          (f) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package and prior to the First Time of Delivery, there shall not have been any Material Adverse Change which, in the judgment of the Representatives, materially impairs the investment quality of the Securities, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof;
          (g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice Chairman, any Executive or Senior Vice President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated each Time of Delivery, in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement (except in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery the representations and warranties in Sections 1(c), 1(g) and 1(j), and it being understood, however, that in the case of any Optional Time of Delivery, the representations and warranties in Section 1(h) and 1(i) shall be limited to the Optional Securities) are true and correct, in all material respects, as of each Time of Delivery, that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied, in all material respects, at or prior to each Time of Delivery, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are threatened by the Commission, and that, with respect to the First Time of Delivery only, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package, there has not been any Material Adverse Change, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; and

          (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
 
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the applicable Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees
 
to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Underwriter
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
pro rata
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 or for any other reason, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriters except as provided in Section 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly.
     All statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Underwriter, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail as set forth in Schedule I hereto
 
under such Underwriter's name, and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to 70 Pine Street, New York, New York 10270, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 785-1584, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
     16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     17. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
     18. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
     19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by each of you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and each of you in accordance with its terms.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May , 2007 (the ""), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the ""), of $ aggregate principal amount of the Company's % Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2007, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated June , 2007 (together, the ""), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the ""), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that:

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of $ aggregate principal amount of % Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") of American International Group, Inc. (the "Company").
l
l
     The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed on different dates on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution.
     The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Commission on July 24, 2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated June , 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
l
 
     As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, as of the effective date of Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
     (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
     (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of :00A/P.M. on May , 2007 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement,contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or

     (c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this paragraph has caused us to believe that (a) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, when considered together with any other disclosures added in the Prospectus Supplement,as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
[
]
     The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures", "Replacement Capital Covenant" (except for the definition of "Qualifying Capital Securities"), "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued, the Replacement Capital Covenant dated the date hereof or the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Securities, or insofar as they relate to provisions of U.S. Federal tax law therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statements, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the
 
statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued.
     This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

     I am Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company.
     This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May , 2007 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of $ aggregate principal amount of the Company's  - % Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2007, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated June , 2007 (together, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee").

     The two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-106040 and 333-31024) were filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") on different dates on Form S-3. The Registration Statements were amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 24,
 
2006. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest Registration Statement as amended by Post-Effective Amendment No. 1. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 24, 2006 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated June , 2007 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
 - 
     In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, you are advised that, in my opinion:
(i) The Company has authorized capital as incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Basic Prospectus.
(ii) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as exhibits thereto, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed.
(iii) The issue and sale of the Securities, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or
 
violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental body applicable to the Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities and as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
(iv) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of ___:00 A/P.M. on May , 2007 (the "Applicable Time") (which you have informed me is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), when considered together with any other disclosure added in the Prospectus Supplement,contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any

material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(v) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
     In rendering the opinion in paragraph (iv), (A) I assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Terms of the Series A-4 Junior Subordinated Debentures" and "Replacement Capital Covenant" (except for the definition of "Qualifying Capital Securities") in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, the Indenture under which the Securities are to be issued therein described and the Replacement Capital Covenant dated the date hereof, and (B) I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued.
 
     In rendering the opinion in paragraph (v), I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement.
     This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-month LIBOR with respect to that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-month LIBOR with respect to that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Interest Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Interest Period and in an amount that, in the Calculation Agent's judgment, is representative of a single transaction in that market at that time. However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are quoting as described above, Three-month LIBOR for that Interest Period will be the same as Three-month LIBOR as determined for the previous Interest Period or, in the case of the Interest Period beginning on the Scheduled Maturity Date, 5.36%.

     In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee as his or her attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default or Enforcement Event with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% (or, in the case of an Enforcement Event, a majority) in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default or Enforcement Event, as the case may be, as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates to the extent provided by Section 2.1(n) of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25.00 and integral multiples of $25.00 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires beneficial interest in, this Security agree that, for United States federal, state and local tax purposes, it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness.
