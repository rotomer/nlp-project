          (c) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Schedule III hereto (it being understood, however, that in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery, that the opinion shall only cover the opinion in paragraph (1) and, with respect to the Optional Shares, the opinion in paragraph (2) set forth in Schedule III hereto);
          (d) Kathleen E. Shannon, Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives her opinion, dated each Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Schedule IV hereto (it being understood, however, that in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery, that the opinion shall only cover the opinion in paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) set forth in Schedule IV hereto and shall be limited to the Optional Shares);
          (e) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement and the First Time of Delivery, the independent registered public accounting firm who
 
have audited the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, to the effect set forth in Schedule V hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;

          (g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice Chairman, any Executive or Senior Vice President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated each Time of Delivery, in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement (except in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery the representations and warranties in Sections 1(c), 1(g) and 1(o), and it being understood, however, that in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery, the representations and warranties in Section 1(h) and 1(j) shall be limited to the Optional Shares) are true and correct, in all material respects, as of each Time of Delivery, that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied, in all material respects, at or prior to each Time of Delivery, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are threatened by the Commission, and that, with respect to the First Time of Delivery only, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package, there has not been any Material Adverse Change, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof;
          (h) On or after the date hereof and prior to the First Time of Delivery, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange if the effect of any such event, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the purchase by the Underwriters of the Securities from the Company; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State authorities; (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, other than any such outbreak, escalation or declaration arising out of or relating to the U.S. war on terrorism that does not represent a significant departure from the conditions that exist at the date hereof, if the effect of any such event in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; (iv) the suspension of trading in the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, if the effect of such event in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives is to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the

     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and , , that the foregoing indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a), with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, where (i) prior to the Applicable Time the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in a further amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing

Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and such corrected Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter prior to the Applicable Time, (iii) such corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the contract for sale of the Securities to such person and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above.
          (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, except to the extent that it has been prejudiced by such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff that is not subject to further appeal, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party
 
is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the respective Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the applicable Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Underwriter
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the applicable Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
pro rata
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the applicable Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as
 
provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 8 hereof is not satisfied (other than any termination pursuant to Section 8(h)(i), (ii) or (iii) hereof), or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly.
     All statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Underwriter, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail as set forth in Schedule I hereto under such Underwriter's name, and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to 70 Pine Street, New York, New York 10270, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 785-1584, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, their respective officers and directors and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently
 
advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
     16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     17. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
     18. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
     19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
          If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by each of you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and each of you in accordance with its terms.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of 171,052,631 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that:
     (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
     (2) All outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, including the Securities, have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.
     (3) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
          We have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the certificates for the outstanding shares of Common Stock, including the Securities, conform to the specimen thereof examined by us and have been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
Very truly yours,
 
May 16, 2008
[Name and Address of Underwriters]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of 171,052,631 shares (the "Securities") of common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of American International Group, Inc. (the "Company").
     Two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-143992 and 333-106040) were filed on different dates on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest filed Registration Statement.
     The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated July 13, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
     As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement,
 
appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
     (a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
     (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:00 P.M. on May 12, 2008 (which you have informed us is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
     (c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this paragraph has caused us to believe that (a) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, or (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Common Stock AIG May Offer" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of the Equity Units," "Certain United States Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Common Stock" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, equity units and the Underwriting Agreement therein described or insofar as they relate to provisions of United States Federal tax law therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package.
 
     This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

[Name and Address of Underwriters]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          I am Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company.
          This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of 171,052,631 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock").
          Two Registration Statements relating to the Securities (File Nos. 333-143992 and 333-106040) were filed on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") on different dates. The latest filed Registration Statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 13, 2007. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest filed Registration Statement. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 13, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
          In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:
          (i) The Company has authorized capital stock as set forth in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, as incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Basic Prospectus; and all outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, including the Securities, have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessble.
          (ii) The issue and sale of the Securities, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, will not result in a breach of any of the
 
terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental body applicable to the Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof.
          (iii) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act, such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations and qualifications required to list the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities and as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
          (iv) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as exhibits thereto, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed.
          (v) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:00 P.M. on May 12, 2008 (the "Applicable Time") (which you have informed me is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any
 
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          (vi) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
          In rendering the opinion in paragraph (v), (A) I assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Common Stock AIG May Offer" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of the Equity Units" in the Prospectus Supplement insofar as they constitute summaries of the documents therein described, and (B) I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package.
          In rendering the opinion in paragraph (vi), I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in the documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement.
          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
          I have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed that the certificates for the outstanding shares of Common Stock, including the Securities, conform to the specimen thereof examined by me and have been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock, and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, assumptions which I have not independently verified.
          This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person.  This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

          (c) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their opinion or opinions, dated each Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Schedule III hereto (it being understood, however, that in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery, that the opinion shall only cover the opinion in paragraph (1) and, with respect to the Optional Securities, the opinion in paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) set forth in Schedule III hereto);
 
          (d) Kathleen E. Shannon, Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives her opinion, dated each Time of Delivery, to the effect set forth in Schedule IV hereto (it being understood, however, that in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery, that the opinion shall only cover the opinion in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) set forth in Schedule IV hereto and shall be limited to the Optional Securities);
          (e) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement and the First Time of Delivery, the independent registered public accounting firm who have audited the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, to the effect set forth in Schedule V hereto, and with respect to such letter dated such Time of Delivery, as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives;
          (f) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package (excluding any amendment or supplement thereto) and prior to the First Time of Delivery, there shall not have been in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives any Material Adverse Change, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus (excluding any amendment or supplement thereto);
          (g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice Chairman, any Executive or Senior Vice President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated each Time of Delivery, in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement (except in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery the representations and warranties in Sections 1(c), 1(g) and 1(n), and it being understood, however, that in the case of the Optional Time of Delivery, the representations and warranties in Sections 1(i), 1(o) through and including 1(q), 1(s) and 1(t) shall be limited to the Optional Securities) are true and correct, in all material respects, as of each Time of Delivery, that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied, in all material respects, at or prior to each Time of Delivery, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are threatened by the Commission, and that, with respect to the First Time of Delivery only, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Disclosure Package, there has not been any Material Adverse Change, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof;

     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein; and , , that the foregoing indemnity agreement contained in this Section 9(a), with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, where (i) prior to the Applicable Time the Company shall have notified such Underwriter that the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits to state
provided
however
provided
further
 
therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) such untrue statement or omission of a material fact was corrected in a further amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or, where permitted by law, an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and such corrected Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus was provided to such Underwriter prior to the Applicable Time, (iii) such corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) was not conveyed to such person at or prior to the contract for sale of the Securities to such person and (iv) such loss, claim, damage or liability would not have occurred had the corrected Registration Statement, Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (excluding any document incorporated by reference therein) been conveyed to such person as provided for in clause (iii) above.
          (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection, except to the extent that it has been prejudiced by such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff that is not subject to further appeal, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
 
judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the respective Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the applicable Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Underwriter
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the applicable Time of Delivery, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
pro rata
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate number of all the Securities to be purchased at the applicable Time of Delivery, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 8 hereof is not satisfied (other than any termination pursuant to Section 8(h)(i), (ii) or (iii) hereof), or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly.
     All statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Underwriter, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail as set forth in Schedule I hereto under such Underwriter's name, and if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to 70 Pine Street, New York, New York 10270, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 785-1584, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, their respective officers and directors and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
 
     16. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     17. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
     18. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
     19. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us five counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by each of you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement between the Company and each of you in accordance with its terms.

[Name and Address of Underwriters]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of 72,000,000 equity units (the "Securities"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Each Security has an initial stated amount of $75 and initially consists of (i) a stock purchase contract (the "Stock Purchase Contract"), with settlement dates on each of February 15, 2011, May 1, 2011 and August 1, 2011 and (ii) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.67% Series B-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-1 Debentures"), a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.82% Series B-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-2 Debentures") and a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.89% Series B-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-3 Debentures" and, together with the Series B-1 Debentures and the Series B-2 Debentures, "Debentures"). The Stock Purchase Contracts have been issued under the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2008 (the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Purchase Contract Agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"); the Debentures have been issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2007, as amended and supplemented by the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Supplemental Indentures, each dated as of May 16, 2008 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"); and up to 154,738,080 shares (the "Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), are initially issuable upon settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Debentures will be pledged by the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Securities, to Wilmington Trust Company, as Collateral Agent, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2008 (the "Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and Wilmington Trust Company, as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary, to secure the holders' obligations to purchase the Shares in accordance with the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon the basis of the aforementioned examination, it is our opinion that:
 
     The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     We have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the
 
Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Purchase Contract Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Purchase Contract Agent, that the Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary, that the Remarketing Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Remarketing Agents, that the Securities and Debentures conform to the specimens thereof examined by us, that the Purchase Contract Agent's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Purchase Contract Agent's authorized signatories, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Debentures have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized signatories, that the certificate for the Shares will conform to the specimen thereof examined by us and will be duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
Very truly yours,
 
May 16, 2008
[Name and Address of Underwriters]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and offering of 72,000,000 Equity Units (the "Securities") of American International Group, Inc. (the "Company").
     Two Registration Statements (File Nos. 333-143992 and 333-106040) relating to the Securities were filed on different dates on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest filed Registration Statement.
     The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated July 13, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
     As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package") and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Securities Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, each part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
 
Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,

[Name and Address of Underwriters]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          I am Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company.
          This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of 72,000,000 Equity Units (the "Securities") of the Company. Each Security has an initial stated amount of $75 and initially consists of (i) a stock purchase contract (the "Stock Purchase Contract"), with settlement dates on each of February 15, 2011, May 1, 2011 and August 1, 2011 and (ii) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.67% Series B-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-1 Debentures"), a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.82% Series B-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-2 Debentures") and a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.89% Series B-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-3 Debentures" and, together with the Series B-1 Debentures and the Series B-2 Debentures, "Debentures"). The Stock Purchase Contracts have been issued under the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2008 (the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Purchase Contract Agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"); the Debentures have been issued pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2007, as amended and supplemented by the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Supplemental Indentures, each dated as of May 16, 2008 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee; and up to 154,738,080 shares (the "Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), are initially issuable upon settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Debentures will be pledged by the Purchase Contract Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Securities, to Wilmington Trust Company, as Collateral Agent, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2008 (the "Pledge Agreement"), among the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and Wilmington Trust Company, as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent and Securities Intermediary, to secure the holders' obligations to purchase the Shares in accordance with the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement.
 
          Two Registration Statements (File Nos. 333-143992 and 333-106040) relating to the Securities, the Stock Purchase Contracts, the Debentures and the Shares were filed on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") on different dates. The latest filed Registration Statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 13, 2007. References in this letter to the Registration Statement refer to the latest filed Registration Statement. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated July 13, 2007 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
          In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below), being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:
          (i) The Company has authorized capital stock as set forth in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, as incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Basic Prospectus; all outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessble; and the Shares have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance upon delivery in accordance with the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement, and when issued and paid for in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement, such Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
          (ii) The issue and sale of the Securities, and the issue of the Stock Purchase Contracts and Debentures, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Indenture, the Pledge Agreement and the Remarketing Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2008 (the "Remarketing Agreement"), among the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Remarketing Agents, will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or governmental body applicable to the Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities, the Stock Purchase Contracts or the Debentures, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof.
          (iii) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issuance and sale of the Securities, the issuance of the Stock Purchase Contracts or the Debentures, or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Indenture, the Pledge Agreement or the
 
Remarketing Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Act, such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations and qualifications required to list the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities, the Stock Purchase Contracts or the Debentures and as may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Remarketing Agreement and under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities, the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Debentures by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
          (iv) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as exhibits thereto, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed.
          (v) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:00 P.M. on May 12, 2008 (the "Applicable Time") (which you have informed me is prior to the time of the first sale of the Securities by any Underwriter), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          (vi) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
          In rendering the opinion in paragraph (v), (A) I assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except for those made under the captions "Description of Purchase Contracts AIG May Offer," "Description of Units AIG May Offer," "Description of Common Stock AIG May Offer" and "Description of
 
Junior Subordinated Debentures AIG May Offer" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of the Equity Units," "Description of the Stock Purchase Contracts," "Certain Provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement," "Description of Our Debentures" and "Description of Our Capital Stock" in the Prospectus Supplement insofar as they constitute summaries of the documents therein described, and (B) I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the Pricing Disclosure Package.
          In rendering the opinion in paragraph (vi), I express no opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in the documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, or as to the report of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' attestation report thereon, each as included in the documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement.
          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
          I have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed that the certificates for the outstanding shares of Common Stock conform to the specimen thereof examined by me and have been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock, that the certificates for the Shares will conform to the specimen thereof examined by me and will be duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock, and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, assumptions which I have not independently verified.
                    This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President, Secretary and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.
                     Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit made in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations as to the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
5. Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that:

Those officials referred to above stated that due to the fact that there is no consolidated financial data available subsequent to March 31, 2008, they are unable to comment as to whether there was any such change, increase or decrease, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases that the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur.

If a Holder of Corporate Units does not, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Stock Purchase Date, notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Settlement with Cash, or does so notify the Purchase Contract Agent but fails to make an effective Settlement with Cash on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Stock Purchase Date, such notice of Settlement with Cash shall automatically be deemed withdrawn and without effect.
     Upon the occurrence of a Failed Remarketing with respect to the Debentures of any series that constitute part of Corporate Units, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to the Pledged Debentures of such series underlying the Corporate Units, and may, to the extent permitted by law, among other things, (A) deliver such Debentures to the Company in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts on the applicable Stock Purchase Date (but not any Additional Debentures issued to pay Deferred Interest or accrued interest on such Debentures) or (B) sell such Debentures in one or more public or private sales or otherwise and apply the proceeds from the sale of such Debentures to satisfy in full the Holders' obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts and remit the excess, if any, of the

     Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Debentures or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with terms of the Pledge Agreement and Purchase Contract Agreement. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or shall not refrain from exercising such right, as the case may be, if, in the judgment of the Company, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Debentures. The Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. The Holders of Corporate Units shall have no voting or other rights in respect of Common Stock.

     (ii) instruct the Securities Intermediary to release from the Pledge such Holder's related Pledged Securities of the applicable series, as to which such Holder has effected a Settlement with Cash pursuant to this Section 5.5(a); and

     The Company shall instruct the Collateral Agent in writing as to the Permitted Investments in which any such cash shall be invested; that if the Company fails to deliver such instructions by 10:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the day such payments are received by the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall invest such payments in the Permitted Investments as described in clause (vi) of the definition of Permitted Investments. The Collateral Agent shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the failure of the Company to provide written investment direction. The Collateral Agent may conclusively rely on any written direction and shall bear no liability for any loss or other damage based on acting or omitting to act under this Section 5.5(a) pursuant to any direction of the Company and neither the Collateral Agent nor the Securities Intermediary shall in any way be liable for the selection of Permitted Investments or by reason of any insufficiency in a Collateral Account resulting from any loss on any Permitted Investment included therein.

Pledge Agreement
 
Cash, but fails to deposit such cash as required by Section 5.02(b)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, to the extent of the amount of cash not so deposited, such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of such Holder's Pledged Securities in accordance with Section 5.02(b)(iii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, and in the case of such failure as provided in clause (ii) of this Section 5.5(b), also be deemed to withdraw such notice to the Purchase Contract Agent to effect the Settlement with Cash to the extent of the amount of cash not deposited as required by Section 5.02(b)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement; that the cash deposited as required by Section 5.02(b)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement shall be in integral multiples of $1,000, and any amount in a fraction of such integral multiples shall be deemed not deposited as provided in clause (ii) of this Section 5.5(b) and transferred to the Purchase Contract Agent promptly.

Section 5.6
Early Settlement and Cash Merger Early Settlement.
     Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of a notice from the Purchase Contract Agent that a Holder of Equity Units has elected to effect either (i) Early Settlement of its obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts forming a part of such Equity Units in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contracts and Section 5.07 of the Purchase Contract Agreement or (ii) Cash Merger Early Settlement of its obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts forming a part of such Equity Units in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Contracts and Section 5.04(b)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement (which notice shall set forth the number of such Stock Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement), and that the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amount or Purchase Price for each $25 stated amount of Stock Purchase Contracts being settled pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement, then the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge (1) the applicable Pledged Debentures of each series in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (2) the applicable Pledged Treasury Securities of each series, in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, in each case in an amount equal to the product of (x) $25 for each $25 stated amount of Stock Purchase Contracts being settled, and (y) the number of Stock Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement or Cash Merger
Pledge Agreement
 
Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Debentures or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby.
     
Section 5.7
Application of Proceeds in Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.
     (a) In the event of a Successful Remarketing of a series of Debentures, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer the Pledged Debentures of such series to the Remarketing Agent, upon confirmation of deposit by the Remarketing Agent of the Proceeds of such Successful Remarketing (less, to the extent permitted by the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent's Fee) in the Collateral Account and the Collateral Agent shall thereupon instruct the Securities Intermediary to purchase the Treasury Portfolio with the Proceeds of the Successful Remarketing. A Holder of Corporate Units shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the Stock Purchase Contract underlying the Corporate Units from the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Portfolio after a Successful Remarketing. Without receiving any instruction from any Holder, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to remit the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Portfolio equal to the purchase price of the shares of Common Stock to be delivered on the applicable Stock Purchase Date to the Company to satisfy in full such Holder's obligations to pay the Purchase Price to purchase shares of Common Stock under the related Stock Purchase Contracts on such Stock Purchase Date and to remit the balance of the Proceeds from the related Pledged Treasury Portfolio, if any, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder.
     In the event of a Failed Remarketing with respect to any series of Debentures, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will, at the written instruction of the Company, deliver the Pledged Debentures of such series in accordance with the Company's written instructions to satisfy in full, from any such disposition or retention, such Holders' obligations to pay the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued on the applicable Stock Purchase Date under the Stock Purchase Contracts underlying such Corporate Units. The Holders recognize that there may be restrictions under the U.S. Federal securities laws on the ability of the Collateral Agent to sell the Pledged Debentures and that the Pledged Debentures may need to be sold in a non-public transaction to a limited number of institutional investors or a sale may need to be delayed in order to register the sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As a result, the proceeds from any sale of the Pledged Debentures may be substantially less than the principal amount of the Debentures. If the Company retains the Pledged Debentures in satisfaction of the Obligations, the Holders and the Company agree, to the extent permitted by law, that the Pledged Debentures will be treated as sold to the Company for a purchase price equal to the principal amount thereof. The Holders agree, to the extent permitted by law, that the principal amount is not less than the value of the Pledged Debentures in the context of a Failed Remarketing. If the Pledged Debentures are sold other than to the Company, the Collateral Agent shall promptly remit the Proceeds, if any, of the Pledged Debentures of such series in excess of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued on the applicable Stock Purchase Date for such series under such Stock Purchase Contracts to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the Corporate Units to which such Debentures relate.
     If a Holder of Corporate Units (unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Debentures represented by such Corporate Units) has not elected to effect a Settlement with Cash by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent in the manner provided for in Section 5.02(b)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement or does notify the Purchase Contract Agent as provided in Section 5.02(b)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement of its intention to effect a Settlement with Cash, but fails to deliver the appropriate amount of cash as required by Section 5.02(b)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, such Holder shall
Pledge Agreement
 
be deemed to have consented to the disposition of such Holder's Pledged Securities and Pledged Treasury Portfolio, if applicable, in accordance with Section 5.02(b)(iii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the preceding paragraph upon a Failed Remarketing.
     (b) A Holder of Treasury Units (unless such Holder elects to effect a Settlement with Cash pursuant to Section 5.5) shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the Stock Purchase Contract on any Stock Purchase Date underlying the Treasury Units from the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities. Without receiving any instruction from any Holder, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to remit the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities to the Company in settlement of such Stock Purchase Contracts on such Stock Purchase Date (in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units). In the event the Proceeds from Permitted Investments acquired with the proceeds of Qualifying Treasury Securities prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date exceeds the aggregate Purchase Price of the Stock Purchase Contracts being settled on such Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to transfer such excess, when received, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to Holders.
     
Section 6.1
Voting and Other Consensual Rights.
     Subject to the terms of Section 4.02 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Debentures or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement; that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or shall not refrain from exercising such right, as the case may be, if, in the judgment of the Company, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Debentures; that the Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Debentures, including notice of any meeting at which holders of the Debentures are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of the Debentures, the Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Purchase Contract Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefore from the Purchase Contract Agent, execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Debentures (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Company and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent with respect to the Pledged Debentures.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such remedies may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (1) retention of the Pledged Debentures of the applicable series (or, if such Pledged Debentures shall have been sold in a Successful Remarketing, of the Pledged Treasury Portfolio) or the Pledged Treasury Securities of the applicable series or (2) sale of such Pledged Debentures, Pledged Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities in one or more public or private sales, in either case in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Stock Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement.
     (b) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, in the event the Collateral Agent is unable to make payments from amounts transferred or transferable to the Company on account of the principal payments of any Pledged Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities (including, without limitation, any Permitted Investments purchased with the proceeds of any of the foregoing) as provided in Article III, in satisfaction of the Obligations of the Holders of the Equity Units under the related Stock Purchase Contracts on any Stock Purchase Date, the inability to make such payments shall constitute an "event of default" hereunder and the Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise, with reference to such Collateral any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the UCC and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise granted herein or under any other law.
     (c) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to receive and collect all payments of (i) the principal amount of the Pledged Debentures and (ii) the principal amount of any Pledged Treasury Portfolio or Pledged Treasury Securities (including, without limitation, any Permitted Investments purchased with the proceeds of any of the foregoing), subject, in each case, to the provisions of Article III, and as otherwise granted herein.
     (d) The Purchase Contract Agent, as attorney-in-fact of the Holders, and each Holder of Equity Units agrees that, from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent or the Purchase Contract Agent, such Holder and the Purchase Contract Agent, as attorney-in-fact of the Holders, shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as the Company may reasonably request in order to maintain the Pledge, and the perfection and priority thereof, and to confirm the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Collateral Agent hereunder, except for liability for its own negligent acts, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct.

Section 7.3
Successful Remarketing.
     In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Collateral Agent shall, at the written direction of the Company, instruct the Securities Intermediary to (i) Transfer the applicable Pledged Debentures to the Remarketing Agent upon confirmation of deposit by the Remarketing Agent of the Proceeds of such Successful Remarketing (after deducting any Remarketing Agent's Fee in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement) in the Collateral Account and apply such Proceeds to purchase the Treasury Portfolio, (ii) Transfer the Treasury Portfolio (other than the Pledged Treasury Portfolio) to the Custodial Agent for deposit in an account separate from the Collateral Account, (iii) apply an amount from the Proceeds of the Pledged Treasury Portfolio on the applicable Stock Purchase Date equal to the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Stock Purchase Contracts on the applicable Stock Purchase Date in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations to pay the Purchase Price under the related Stock Purchase Contracts, and (iv) promptly remit the remaining portion of such Proceeds to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units, in accordance with their respective interests and the Purchase Contract Agreement. In the case of the Treasury Portfolio purchased with the Proceeds of the Pledged Debentures on the First Remarketing Settlement Date, on the next Payment Date the Custodial Agent shall remit the remaining portion of the Proceeds of the portion of the Treasury Portfolio corresponding to clause (ii) of the definition of such term to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, in accordance with their respective interests and the Purchase Contract Agreement. On the applicable Stock Purchase Date, the Custodial Agent shall promptly remit the remaining portion of the Proceeds of the Treasury Portfolio to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units, in accordance with their respective interests and the Purchase Contract Agreement. With respect to Separate Debentures, any Proceeds of such Remarketing (after deducting any Remarketing Agent's Fee in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement) attributable to the Separate Debentures will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Debentures. In the event of a Failed Remarketing, the Pledged Debentures shall remain credited to the Collateral Account and Section 5.7 shall apply.
     
Section 7.4

The Custodial Agent shall hold Separate Debentures in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Pledged Securities and Pledged Treasury Portfolio shall be held. Holders of Separate Debentures electing to have their Separate Debentures remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit G, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Period Start Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Debentures to such Holder.

Section 7.5
Substitutions.

SCHEDULE I

Exhibit 5.1
May 16, 2008
American International Group, Inc.
     70 Pine Street,
     New York, New York 10270.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the several purchases today by the Underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 12, 2008 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Representatives of the several Underwriters, of 196,710,525 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that:
     1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
     2. The Securities have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.
     The foregoing opinion is limited to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     We have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the certificates for the Securities will conform to the specimen thereof examined by us and will be duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
 
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statements (File Nos. 333-150865; 333-143992 and 333-106040). In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1993.
Very truly yours,

Morgan Securities Inc., as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of 78,400,000 equity units (the "Securities"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Each Security has an initial stated amount of $75 and initially consists of a stock purchase contract (the "Stock Purchase Contract"), with settlement dates on each of February 15, 2011, May 1, 2011 and August 1, 2011, and a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.67% Series B-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-1 Debentures"), a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.82% Series B-2 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-2 Debentures") and a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.89% Series B-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures (the "Series B-3 Debentures" and, together with the Series B-1 Debentures and the Series B-2 Debentures, "Debentures"). The Stock Purchase Contracts have been issued under the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of May 16, 2008 (the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Purchase Contract Agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"); the Debentures have been issued pursuant to Junior Subordinated Debt Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2007, as amended and supplemented by the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Supplemental Indentures, each dated as of May 16, 2008 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"); and up to 154,738,080 shares (the "Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), are initially issuable upon settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts. Upon the basis of the aforementioned examination, it is our opinion that:
