provided
 
instrument signed only by the Corporation (and without the consent of the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt) if any of the following apply (it being understood that any such amendment or supplement may fall into one or more of the following): (i) the effect of such amendment or supplement is solely to impose additional restrictions on, or eliminate certain of, the types of securities qualifying as Replacement Capital Securities and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate to that effect, (ii) such amendment or supplement is not materially adverse to the rights of the Covered Debtholders hereunder and an officer of the Corporation has delivered to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other instrument with respect to such Covered Debt a written certificate stating that, in his or her determination, such amendment or supplement is not materially adverse to the Covered Debtholders, or (iii) such amendment or supplement eliminates Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity, Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and/or Rights to acquire Common Stock as Replacement Capital Securities if, after the date of the Offering Memorandum, an accounting standard or interpretive guidance of an existing standard issued by an organization or regulator that has responsibility for establishing or interpreting accounting standards in the United States becomes effective such that there is more than an insubstantial risk that the failure to eliminate Common Stock, Debt Exchangeable for Common Equity, Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock and/or Rights to acquire Common Stock as Replacement Capital Securities would result in a reduction in the Corporation's earnings per share as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
