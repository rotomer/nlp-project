Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Award Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other enforceable restrictions contained herein.
 
     (C) You acknowledge and agree that the Company's remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Paragraph 6(a) would be inadequate, and, in recognition of this fact, you agree that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to seek equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
     (b) . If, prior to the Scheduled Vesting Date for any Restricted Shares, the Board determines, upon adoption of a resolution by a majority of the Board other than you, and after providing you, together with counsel, a reasonable opportunity to be heard before the Board, that (i) you materially breached this Award Agreement (including, without limitation, by attempting to have any dispute under this Award Agreement or the Plan resolved in any manner that is not provided for by Paragraph 15) or (ii) grounds existed, on or prior to the date of termination of your Employment with the Company, to terminate your employment for Cause, then your rights in respect of your then outstanding Restricted Shares shall immediately terminate, and you shall forfeit such Shares with no further right or interest therein.
Forfeiture
     (c) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Award Agreement to the contrary, you acknowledge and agree that any vesting of Restricted Shares or delivery of Certificates that would occur after termination of your Employment with the Company is conditional upon and subject to your execution of a release and waiver, substantially in the form set forth on , of certain claims you may have against the Company and its directors, officers and affiliates, except as expressly excluded in the release or in any other written agreement between you and AIG. If the release and waiver does not become effective and irrevocable within 45 days of the date of termination of your Employment with the Company, your rights in respect of your then outstanding Restricted Shares shall immediately terminate, and you shall forfeit such Shares with no further right or interest therein.
