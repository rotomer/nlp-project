D. Continued Health Coverage and Participation in Retiree Health
     If an Eligible Employee experiences a Covered Termination, the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to participate during the Severance Period in the applicable Company-provided health plan for active employees in which the Eligible Employee participated prior to termination by paying on an after-tax basis the applicable employee contribution charged to active employees receiving similar coverage. If the Eligible Employee participates in such plan, the actuarial cost of such coverage in excess of the applicable employee contribution paid by the Eligible Employee, as determined by the Company, shall be imputed as taxable income to the Eligible Employee. Upon the last day of the Severance Period, the Eligible Employee shall be treated as having had a termination event as of the date that the Severance Period ends for purposes of continuing coverage requirements under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("").
COBRA
     If an Eligible Employee experiences a Covered Termination, the Eligible Employee's Severance Period (but not including any period of coverage under COBRA) shall be treated as a period of employment service (in connection with both the age and service requirements) for purposes of determining the Eligible Employee's eligibility to participate, in and to calculate the amount of, the Company contribution towards any Company retiree health plan. For these purposes, the Eligible Employee's deemed period of employment service shall end as of the last day of the Severance Period. If the Eligible Employee would not have satisfied the eligibility requirements to participate in any Company retiree health plan but for the preceding treatment of the Severance Period as a period of employment service, the actuarial cost of such retiree health coverage in excess of any contribution paid by the Eligible Employee, as determined by the Company, shall be imputed as income for all periods in which such retiree health coverage is provided. If, however, the Eligible Employee satisfies the eligibility requirements to participate in any Company retiree health plan on the basis of the Eligible Employee's age and years of service on or before the date of termination, then no such income imputation shall occur with respect to retiree health coverage.
     . 
E
Additional Non-qualified Pension Credits
     If an Eligible Employee experiences a Covered Termination, the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to additional service credit and credit for additional age, in each case in an amount equal to the length of the Severance Period, for purposes of calculating the
 
Eligible Employee's benefit amounts, and determining vesting and eligibility for retirement (including early retirement), under the Company's non-qualified pension plans (plans that are not intended to be qualified under the provisions of Code section 401) in which such Eligible Employee was actively participating immediately prior to his or her date of termination. For the avoidance of doubt, no Severance Installments pursuant to Section IV.B of this Plan shall be included in the calculation of any benefits of an Eligible Employee under any non-qualified pension plan of the Company. Eligible Employees shall commence payments under such non-qualified pension plans at the time specified in the applicable plan, determined as if "Qualified Plan Retirement Income" (as defined in the applicable plan) began to be paid immediately following the Eligible Employee's date of termination.
     
F. Continued Life Insurance and Participation in Retiree Life
     If an Eligible Employee experiences a Covered Termination, the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to participate during the Severance Period in the group life insurance benefits generally available to active employees of the Company. The Eligible Employee shall be required to pay the costs of such coverage on the same basis as prior to the date of termination. Any portion of the premium paid by the Company shall be imputed as taxable income to the Eligible Employee. If an Eligible Employee experiences a Covered Termination, the Eligible Employee's Severance Period shall be treated as a period of employment service (in connection with both the age and service requirements) for purposes of determining the Eligible Employee's eligibility to participate in and to calculate the amount of a Company contribution towards any Company retiree life insurance coverage. The Eligible Employee's deemed period of employment service shall end as of the close of the Severance Period. If the Eligible Employee would not have satisfied the eligibility requirements to participate in any Company retiree life insurance plan but for the treatment of the Severance Period as a period of employment service, the actuarial cost of such retiree life insurance coverage in excess of any contribution paid by the Eligible Employee, as determined by the Company, shall be imputed as income for all periods in which such retiree life insurance coverage is provided. If, however, the Eligible Employee satisfies the eligibility requirement to participate in any Company retiree life insurance plan on the basis of the Eligible Employee's age and years of service on or before the date of termination, no such income imputation shall occur with respect to retiree life insurance coverage.
     
G. Limitations on Severance
     The amounts described in Subsections B through F of this Section IV (collectively referred to as "") are subject to the Eligible Employee's continued compliance with any applicable release and/or restrictive covenant agreement (referred to generically as the "") that the Company may require under other compensation arrangements (including but not limited to the plans referred to collectively as the Partners Plan, the Senior Partners Plan and the Company's Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan), any applicable employment agreement or the release pursuant to Section VI below. Failure to execute or adhere to such a Release by the Eligible Employee shall result in a forfeiture of all Severance under this Plan. (For the avoidance of doubt, any Severance Installment or other Severance benefit due under the terms of this Plan shall be forfeited to the extent such payment would have otherwise been due but for the Eligible Employee's failure to provide the Company with a duly executed and effective Release.) Nothing herein shall preclude the Company in its sole discretion from requiring the Eligible Employee to
Severance
Release
 
enter into other such releases or agreements as a condition to receiving Severance under this Plan.
     
H. Timing of Payments and Delay for Specified Employees
     Severance Installments shall commence on a payroll date of the Eligible Employee's employer within 90 days following the Eligible Employee's termination of employment. For purposes of Code section 409A, each Severance Installment shall be treated as a separate payment. If the Plan Administrator determines that the Eligible Employee is a "specified employee" for purposes of Code section 409A, any Severance Installment or other Severance benefit that would otherwise be payable or due under Section IV of this Plan shall be delayed for six months to the extent that such Severance is determined to constitute deferred compensation under Code section 409A (taking into account any regulatory exceptions that may be applicable, such as short-term deferral and separation under Code section 409A). In such case, the Eligible Employee shall not receive such Severance Installment or benefit that is subject to the six-month delay until the first scheduled payroll date that occurs more than six months following the date of termination (the "") and, on the First Payment Date, the Company shall pay the Eligible Employee an amount equal to the sum of the Severance Installments that would have been payable in respect of the period preceding the First Payment Date but for the delay imposed on account of Code section 409A.
First Payment Date
     
I. Covenants and for "Cause" Terminations
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, if at any time (a) the Eligible Employee breaches any of the provisions of a Release or (b) the Plan Administrator determines that grounds existed, on or prior to the date of termination of the Eligible Employee's employment with the Company, including prior to the Effective Date, for the Company to terminate the Eligible Employee's employment for "Cause":
     (1) No further payments or benefits shall be due under this Section IV; and
     (2) The Eligible Employee shall be obligated to repay to the Company, immediately and in a cash lump sum, the amount of any Severance Installments and other Severance benefits (other than any amounts received by the Eligible Employee under Sections IV.D, E or F) previously received by the Eligible Employee (which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be calculated on a pre-tax basis);
that the Eligible Employee shall in all events be entitled to receive accrued wages, expense reimbursement and accrued but unused vacation pay as set forth in Section IV.A above.
provided
     
J. No Rights
     Other than as provided in this Section IV, an Eligible Employee shall have no rights to any compensation or any other benefits under this Plan. All other benefits, if any, due to the Eligible Employee following the date of termination shall be determined in accordance with the plans, policies and practices of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.

A. Initial Claim
     To the extent that an Eligible Employee believes that he or she is entitled to a benefit under this Plan that such Eligible Employee has not received, such Eligible Employee may file a claim for benefits under this Plan, as provided in this Section IX of this Plan.

Procedure for Filing a Claim
     An Eligible Employee must submit a claim in writing on the appropriate claim form (or in such other manner acceptable to the Claims Administrator), along with any supporting comments, documents, records and other information, to the Claims Administrator in person or by messenger.
     If an Eligible Employee fails to properly file a claim for a benefit under this Plan, the Eligible Employee shall be considered not to have exhausted all administrative remedies under this Plan, and shall not be able to bring any legal action for the benefit. Claims and appeals of denied claims may be pursued by an Eligible Employee, or if approved by the Claims Administrator, by an Eligible Employee's authorized representative.
     2. 
Initial Claim Review
 
     The Claims Administrator shall conduct the initial claim review. The Claims Administrator shall consider the applicable terms and provisions of this Plan and amendments to this Plan, and any information and evidence presented by the Eligible Employee and any other relevant information.

Initial Benefit Determination
     (a)
Timing of Notification on Initial Claim
     The Claims Administrator shall notify an Eligible Employee about his or her claim within a reasonable period of time, but, in any event, within 90 days after the Plan Administrator or Claims Administrator, as the case may be, receives the Eligible Employee's claim, unless the Claims Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. If the Claims Administrator determines that an extension is needed, the Eligible Employee shall be notified before the end of the initial 90-day period. The notification shall say what special circumstances require an extension of time. The Eligible Employee shall be told the date by which the Claims Administrator expects to render the determination, which in any event shall be within 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period.
     If such an extension is necessary because an Eligible Employee did not submit the information necessary to decide the claim, the time period in which the Plan Administrator is required to make a decision shall be frozen from the date on which the notification is sent to the Eligible Employee until the Eligible Employee responds to the request for additional information. If the Eligible Employee fails to provide the necessary information in a reasonable period of time, the Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, decide the Eligible Employee's claim based on the information already provided.
     (b)
Manner and Content of Notification of Denied Claim
     In the event the Claims Administrator denies an Eligible Employee's claim for benefits, the Claims Administrator shall provide an Eligible Employee with written or electronic notice of any denial, in accordance with applicable U.S. Department of Labor regulations. The notification shall include:
     (i) The specific reason or reasons for the denial;
     (ii) Reference to the specific provision(s) of this Plan on which the determination is based;
     (iii) A description of any additional material or information necessary for an Eligible Employee to revise the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
     (iv) A description of this Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures.
     4. 
Claims Processing
     In the event the Claims Administrator approves an Eligible Employee's claim for benefits, the Claims Administrator shall provide the Release that the Eligible Employee must sign pursuant Section VI of this Plan, and shall coordinate with the applicable
 
Company payroll department, the Company benefits department, and any other Company entity or counsel as necessary to implement the terms of Section IV of this Plan.
     
B. Review of Initial Benefit Denial

Procedure for Filing an Appeal of a Denial
     Any appeal of a denial must be delivered to the Plan Administrator within 60 days after an Eligible Employee receives notice of denial. Failure to appeal within the 60-day period shall be considered a failure to exhaust all administrative remedies under this Plan and shall make an Eligible Employee unable to bring a legal action to recover a benefit under this Plan. An Eligible Employee's appeal must be in writing, using the appropriate form provided by the Plan Administrator (or in such other manner acceptable to the Plan Administrator). The request for an appeal must be filed with the Plan Administrator in person or by messenger, in either case, evidenced by written receipt or by first-class postage-paid mail and return receipt requested, to the Plan Administrator.
     2. 
Review Procedures for Denials
     The Plan Administrator shall provide a review that takes into account all comments, documents, records and other information submitted by an Eligible Employee without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. An Eligible Employee shall have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records and other information relating to the claim and shall be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all relevant documents.
     3. 
Timing of Notification of Benefit Determination on Review
     The Plan Administrator shall notify an Eligible Employee of the Plan Administrator's decision within a reasonable period of time, but in any event within 60 days after the Plan Administrator receives the Eligible Employee's request for review, unless the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require more time for processing the review of the adverse benefit determination.
     If the Plan Administrator determines that an extension is required, the Plan Administrator shall tell an Eligible Employee in writing before the end of the initial 60-day period. The Plan Administrator shall tell the Eligible Employee the special circumstances that require an extension of time, and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the determination on review, which in any event shall be within 60 days from the end of the initial 60-day period.
     If such an extension is necessary because an Eligible Employee did not submit the information necessary to decide the claim, the time period in which the Plan Administrator is required to make a decision shall be frozen from the date on which the notification is sent to the Eligible Employee until the Eligible Employee responds to the request for additional information. If the Eligible Employee fails to provide the necessary information in a reasonable period of time, the Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, decide the Eligible Employee's claim based on the information already provided.
     4. 
Manner and Content of Notification of Benefit Determination on Review
 
     The Plan Administrator shall provide a notice of this Plan's benefit determination on review, in accordance with applicable U.S. Department of Labor regulations. If an Eligible Employee's appeal is denied, the notification shall include:
     (a) The specific reason or reasons for the denial;
     (b) Reference to the specific provision(s) of this Plan on which the determination is based; and
     (c) A statement that the Eligible Employee is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all relevant documents.
     If an Eligible Employees appeal is approved, the Plan Administrator shall forward the claim to the Claims Administrator for processing in accordance with Section IX.A.4 above.
     
C. Legal Action
     An Eligible Employee cannot bring any action to recover any benefit under this Plan if the Eligible Employee does not file a valid claim for a benefit and seek timely review of a denial of that claim.
X. Withholding Taxes
     The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Plan such federal, state, local or other taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
XI. Miscellaneous
     
A. No Effect on Other Benefits

B. Unfunded Obligation
     Any Severance and benefits provided under this Plan shall constitute an unfunded obligation of the Company. Severance Installments and other benefits paid under this Plan will be made, when due, entirely by the Company from its general assets. This Plan shall constitute solely an unsecured promise by the Company to provide Severance to Eligible Employees to the extent provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, any pension, health or life insurance benefits to which an Eligible Employee may be entitled under this Plan shall be provided under other applicable employee benefit plans of the Company. This Plan does not provide the substantive benefits under such other employee benefit plans, and nothing in this Plan shall restrict the Company's ability to amend, modify or terminate such other employee benefit plans.
     
C. Employment Status
 
The Plan is not a contract of employment, does not guarantee the Eligible Employee employment for any specified period and does not limit the right of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company to terminate the employment of the Eligible Employee at any time for any reason or no reason or to change the status of any Eligible Employee's employment or to change any employment policies.

The Plan Administrator shall provide any documents relating to this Plan to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor upon request. The Plan and all rights under this Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with ERISA, and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, with the laws of the State of New York. The Plan shall also be subject to all applicable non-U.S. laws as to Eligible Employees located outside of the United States. Without limiting the generality of this Section XI.E, it is intended that this Plan comply with Code section 409A, including any regulatory exceptions that may be applicable, such as the short-term deferral and separation pay exceptions.
     In the event that any provision of this Plan is not permitted by the local laws of a country or jurisdiction in which an Eligible Employee works, such local law shall supersede that provision of this Plan with respect to that Eligible Employee.
     
F. Assignment
     This Plan shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by an Eligible Employee's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.

     4. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement and Release, or any other agreements, to the contrary, Employee and the Company agree that all agreements between Employee and the Company (or any of its affiliates) will be interpreted and administered so that distributions that are conditioned upon termination of Employee's employment with the Company will be conditioned upon Employee's "separation from service" with the Company within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A"). For purposes of determining the date of the First Payment and the commencement date of any other payments or benefits that are subject to the six-month delay due to Section 409A, your "separation from service" with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A will be September 30, 2008 and the six month delay shall end on April 1, 2009 ("Delay Date"). Each payment under this Agreement and Release and any other Company plan in which you participate (including the SICO Plans) will be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A. Any reimbursements to which you may be entitled will not offset any amounts payable to you under this Agreement and Release, and any reimbursements will be made to you no later than the end of the calendar year in which such expenses were incurred and otherwise in accordance with the reimbursement rules of Section 409A.
     5. Employee has been a participant in the American International Group, Inc. 2005-2006 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan (the "AIG DCPPP"). The AIG DCPPP matures two years from the inception of such plan (the "Maturity Date"). On the Maturity Date of the plan, a certain number of shares of AIG Common Stock were set aside for Employee in accordance with the terms thereof (with respect to the AIG DCPPP, the total set aside shares and pro rata reload shares is a total of 48,000, hereinafter the "AIG DCPPP Shares"). The Company will provide Employee the AIG DCPPP Shares (plus any shares attributable to stock splits or stock dividends paid prior to the payment of the AIG DCPPP Shares to Employee) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the AIG DCPPP. The AIG DCPPP Shares shall be issued to Employee within ten (10) business days after the Delay Date.
In the event of Employee's death prior to the Delay Date, Employee's estate would receive the AIG DCPPP Shares within ten (10) business days after the Delay Date. No cash dividends or other property rights pertaining to the AIG DCPPP Shares (other than the stock splits or stock dividends described above) will accrue or accumulate to Employee or Employee's estate's benefit during the period prior to Employee's receipt of such shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Release.
     6. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the AIG Partners Plan the Company will provide Employee: (a) with respect to the 2006 transition grant, 16,188 shares of AIG Common Stock, payable within ten (10) business days after the Delay Date; (b) with respect to the 2007 grant, that number of shares of AIG Common Stock that are attributable to the number of performance RSUs earned based on the Company's performance in accordance with such plan (21,000 shares upon achievement of target-level performance), payable within ten (10)
 
business days after the Delay Date; and (c) with respect to the 2008 grant, that number of shares of AIG Common Stock that are attributable to the number of performance RSUs earned based on the Company's performance in accordance with such plan (9,000 shares upon achievement of target-level performance), payable within ten (10) business days after the Delay Date.
     7. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the AIG Senior Partners Plan (the "SPP") and the AIG 2005 Senior Partners Plan (the "2005 SPP") the Company will provide Employee:
 
     8. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Option/RSU Plans, within ten (10) business days after the Delay Date Employee shall receive: (a) 11,483 RSUs (a seventy-five percent (75%) pro-rated amount of the 15,311 unvested RSUs from the grant date of December 13, 2007), and (b) vesting in any currently unvested options, as per the terms and conditions of such option plans.
     9. Employee agrees that if Employee fails to fulfill Employee's duties under paragraphs 11, 12, 13 or 14 below Employee will forfeit the right to receive any of the payments or benefit enhancements set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 above (and the Company shall be entitled to immediately cease paying any amounts remaining due or providing any benefits to Employee pursuant to this Agreement and Release) and, to the extent that any such payments already have been made to Employee or benefit enhancements already implemented at or prior to the time of Employee's failure to satisfy any such condition, Employee must immediately return to the Company all such sums already paid to Employee. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Company's, and where applicable the Released Parties' (as defined below), remedies at law for a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of paragraph 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 of this Agreement and Release would be inadequate and, in recognition of this fact, Employee agrees that, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, in addition to any remedies at law, the Company or the Released Parties, without posting any bond, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form of specific performance, temporary restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be available.
     10. In the event that Employee's employment is terminated by the Company prior to the Termination Date for Cause (as defined below), or Employee resigns from the Company for any reason prior to the Termination Date, all of Employee's rights and the Company's obligations hereunder shall cease and be forfeited as of the date of such termination, including, without limitation, Employee's right to receive any payments or benefits set forth in paragraphs
 
2 and 3 above and Employee shall have no further right or claim to any compensation, benefits or severance under this Agreement and Release or otherwise against any member of the AIG Family from and after the date of termination. Cause means: (a) Employee's failure, refusal or neglect to perform Employee's duties in the manner prescribed by the Company; (b) Employee's engagement in conduct materially injurious to the business reputation or financial condition of any member of the AIG Family; (c) Employee's breach of any provision of this Agreement and Release or any breach of any fiduciary or legal duty to the AIG Family; (d) Employee's failure to comply with any rule or regulation of a regulatory or self regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the activities of the AIG Family, or any willful violation of the Company's Code of Conduct; (e) the Employee's conviction of, or Employee's entry of a plea of guilty or no contest with respect to, a felony or a lesser crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; (f) any willful malfeasance, willful misconduct or gross negligence of Employee in connection with his employment; or (g) any embezzlement, theft or fraud by Employee or his agent.
     11. Employee hereby waives and forever releases and discharges any and all rights and claims Employee may have against the Company, its affiliate or subsidiary companies, or any officer, director or employee of, or any benefit plan (including, but not limited to the DCPPP, AIG Partners Plan, the SPP, the 2005 SPP, or the American International Group, Inc. Executive Severance Plan dated June 27, 2005 and as amended and restated March 13, 2007) sponsored by, any such company (collectively, the "Released Parties") which arise from Employee's employment with any of the Released Parties or the termination of Employee's employment with any of the Released Parties. Specifically, but without limiting that general release, Employee hereby waives any rights or claims Employee might have pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (the "Act") and under the laws of any and all jurisdictions, including without limitation, the United States.

In addition, Employee agrees that there will be no reinstatement or re-employment with the Released Parties and agrees not to bring any claim based upon the failure or refusal of any of the Released Parties to employ Employee hereafter. Nothing herein modifies or affects any vested rights that Employee may have under the Retirement Plan, American International Group, Inc. Incentive Savings Plan, the American International Group, Inc. Supplemental Incentive Savings Plan, or the Option/RSU Plans; nor does this Agreement and Release confer any such rights, which are governed by the terms of the respective plans (and any agreements under such plans).
     12. Employee agrees that when Employee's employment is terminated Employee will execute and not revoke the General Release attached hereto as Attachment A.
     13.

subsidiaries or its affiliates (collectively, the "AIG Family"); (b) have performed any acts which could be considered by the Compensation Committee, upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, to be detrimental to the name, reputation or interest of a member of the AIG Family, including, but not limited to, the inducement of any other person to leave the employ of a member of the AIG Family, or the inducement of any person placing insurance or reinsurance with a member of the AIG Family or purchasing any other product or service from a member of the AIG Family to transfer such business to a person or entity unrelated to the AIG Family or (c) regardless of who initiates the communication, have solicited, participated in the solicitation or recruitment of, or in any manner encouraged or provided assistance to, any employee, consultant or agent of the AIG Family to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with the AIG Family or to leave its employ or other relationship with the AIG Family for any engagement in any capacity or for any other person or entity.
     14. Employee agrees to assist the Company regarding business matters through the Termination Date. In addition, Employee agrees (whether during or after Employee's employment with the Company) to cooperate (a) with the AIG Family in connection with any litigation or regulatory matters in which Employee may have relevant knowledge or information and (b) with all government authorities on matters pertaining to any investigation, litigation or administrative proceeding pertaining to the Released Parties. This cooperation shall include, without limitation, the following: (1) to meet and confer, at a time mutually convenient to Employee and the member(s) of the AIG Family, with the AIG Family's designated in-house or outside attorneys for trial preparation purposes, including answering questions, explaining factual situations, preparing to testify, or appearing for deposition; (2) to appear for trial and give truthful trial testimony without the need to serve a subpoena for such appearance and testimony; (3) to give truthful sworn statements to the AIG Family's attorneys upon their request and, for purposes of any deposition or trial testimony, to adopt the AIG Family's attorneys as Employee's own (provided that there is no conflict of interest that would disqualify the attorneys from representing Employee), and to accept their record instructions at deposition.
     15. Employee agrees (whether during or after Employee's employment with the Company) not to issue, circulate, publish or utter any false or disparaging statements, remarks or rumors about the Released Parties.
     16.

Accordingly, Employee agrees not to discuss or divulge either the existence or contents of this Agreement and Release to anyone other than Employee's immediate family, attorneys or tax advisors, and further agrees to use Employee's best efforts to ensure that none of those individuals will reveal its existence or contents to anyone else. Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, use, divulge, disclose or make accessible to any other person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity, any "Confidential Information" (as defined below) except while employed by the Company, in furtherance of the business of and for the benefit of the AIG Family, or any "Personal Information" (as defined below); provided that Employee may disclose such information when required to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction, by any governmental agency having
 
supervisory authority over the business of a member of the AIG Family, as the case may be, or by any administrative body or legislative body (including a committee thereof) with jurisdiction to order Employee to divulge, disclose or make accessible such information; provided, further, that in the event that Employee is ordered by a court or other government agency to disclose any Confidential Information or Personal Information, Employee shall (a) promptly notify the Company of such order, (b) at the written request of the Company, diligently contest such order at the sole expense of the Company, and (c) at the written request of the Company, seek to obtain, at the sole expense of the Company, such confidential treatment as may be available under applicable laws for any information disclosed under such order.

     17. All discoveries, inventions, ideas, technology, formulas, designs, software, programs, algorithms, products, systems, applications, processes, procedures, methods and improvements and enhancements conceived, developed or otherwise made or created or produced by the Employee alone or with others, and in any way relating to the business or any proposed business of the Company of which the Employee has been made aware, or the products or services of the Company of which the Employee has been made aware, whether or not subject to patent, copyright or other protection and whether or not reduced to tangible form, at any time during the Employee's employment with the Company ("Developments"), shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Employee agrees to, and hereby does, assign to the Company, without any further consideration, all of Employee's right, title and interest throughout the world in and to all Developments.
