Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On October 27, 2008, four affiliates of American International Group, Inc. ("AIG") applied for participation in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Commercial Paper Funding Facility (the "CPFF"). AIG Funding, Inc., International Lease Finance Corporation, Curzon Funding LLC and Nightingale Finance LLC may issue up to approximately $6.9 billion, $5.7 billion, $7.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of commercial paper under the CPFF.
     These AIG affiliates will be participating in the CPFF on the same terms and conditions as other companies that have recently announced plans to participate in the CPFF.
     Proceeds from the issuance of the commercial paper will be used to refinance AIG's outstanding commercial paper as it matures, meet other working capital needs and make voluntary prepayments under AIG's $85 billion credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 
      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
