Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On April 7, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of American International Group, Inc. ("AIG") determined to provide its former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Edward M. Liddy, with an annual stipend of $120,000 in respect of 2009. This stipend represents the overall higher cost of living and inconvenience that Mr. Liddy was required to incur as a result of his service in New York notwithstanding that he and his family resided in Chicago. Since Mr. Liddy retired from AIG in August 2009, he was only eligible for $80,000 of the stipend. AIG was permitted to pay this amount under the TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance after providing the proposal for the stipend to the satisfaction of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
