NEW YORK  May 13, 2010  Chartis today announced that it has entered into a reinsurance transaction with Lodestone Re, which will provide $425 million of protection to Chartis against U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes. This represents a substantial increase from the $250 million of protection originally sought by Chartis. To fund its obligations to Chartis, Lodestone Re issued a catastrophe bond in two tranches  $175 million of Class A notes and $250 million of Class B notes.
The transaction closed on May 12, 2010 and provides Chartis with fully collateralized coverage against losses from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes on a per-occurrence basis until May 2013 using an index trigger with state-specific payment factors. Risk analysis for the transaction is based on Risk Management Solution's (RMS) Hurricane Model Version 9.0 and RMS North America Earthquake Model Version 9.0.
Kristian P. Moor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chartis, said, "As part of our first effort to obtain reinsurance coverage supported by capital market instruments, this transaction represents another important milestone in Chartis' pursuit of increasing financial flexibility and enhancing our risk management capabilities."
Lodestone Re is a special purpose insurer, incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, which has established a program structure enabling potential future catastrophe bond issuances.
