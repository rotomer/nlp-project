Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          On July 14, 2010, American International Group, Inc. ("AIG") approved the terms of a settlement (the "Settlement") with the lead plaintiffs in the putative securities fraud class actions filed beginning in October 2004 in the Southern District of New York, titled In re AIG Securities Litigation. This litigation is described under "2006 Regulatory Settlements and Related Matters  Securities Action  Southern District of New York" in footnote 9 of AIG's unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in AIG's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2010. The Settlement is conditioned on, among other things, court approval and a minimum level of shareholder participation.
          Under the terms of the Settlement, if consummated, AIG will pay an aggregate of $725 million, $175 million of which is to be paid into escrow within ten days of preliminary court approval. AIG's obligation to fund the remainder of the settlement amount is conditioned on its having consummated one or more common stock offerings raising net proceeds of at least $550 million prior to final court approval ("Qualified Offering"). AIG has agreed to use best efforts, consistent with the fiduciary duties of AIG's management and Board of Directors, to effect a Qualified Offering, but the decision as to whether market conditions or pending or contemplated corporate transactions make it commercially reasonable to proceed with such an offering will be within AIG's unilateral discretion. In the event that AIG effects a registered secondary offering of common stock on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") resulting in Treasury receiving proceeds of at least $550 million, then market access will be deemed to have been demonstrated and AIG shall be deemed to have consummated a Qualified Offering. AIG, in its sole discretion, also may fund the $550 million from other sourcesIf AIG does not fund the $550 million before final court approval of the Settlement, the plaintiffs may terminate the agreement, elect to acquire freely transferable shares of AIG common stock with a market value of $550 million provided AIG is able to obtain all necessary approvals, or extend the period for AIG to complete a Qualified Offering.
