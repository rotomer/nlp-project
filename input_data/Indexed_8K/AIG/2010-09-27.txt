RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
     The section below sets forth selected financial information for AIA Group Limited in the nine months and three months ended 31 August 2009 and 2010. This information has not been audited and may be subject to change.
Business scale (TWPI)
     The table below shows the total weighted premium income ("TWPI") by reporting segment for the periods indicated:
 
     TWPI increased by US$950 million, or 11.3%, from US$8,377 million in the nine months ended 31 August 2009 to US$9,327 million in the nine months ended 31 August 2010. This represented an increase of 4.4% on a constant exchange rate basis. Over this period, TWPI increased across all of our product lines and reporting segments.
     Of our reporting segments, TWPI growth was led by Thailand, with an increase of US$237 million, or 14.2%, our other markets, with an increase of US$199 million, or 19.7%, and Korea, with an increase of US$181 million, or 14.0%.
     Of our products, TWPI growth was highest for group insurance products at 24.7%. TWPI growth in standalone A&H insurance products, traditional life insurance products and investment-linked and universal life insurance products, including their respective riders, was 15.8%, 10.1% and 6.4%, respectively.
     Reflecting stable and improving persistency, renewal premiums increased by 12.5%, from US$7,065 million, or 84.3% of TWPI for the nine months ended 31 August 2009, to US$7,946 million, or 85.2% of total TWPI for the corresponding period in 2010.
 
New business (VONB and ANP)
     The table below sets forth an analysis of our new business as measured by VONB, annualized new premiums ("ANP") and new business margin for the periods indicated:
 
     VONB increased by US$88 million, or 23.5%, from US$375 million in the nine months ended 31 August 2009 to US$463 million in the nine months ended 31 August 2010. Over the same period, our new business margin increased from 27% to 33%, reflecting our focus on generating profitable VONB growth. ANP increased by US$65 million, or 4.9%, from US$1,325 million in the nine months ended 31 August 2009 to US$1,390 million in the nine months ended 31 August 2010.
     The table below shows VONB by reporting segment for the periods indicated:
 
 
     VONB in the nine months ended 31 August 2010 increased in all of our reporting segments compared to the nine months ended 31 August 2009. This principally reflected an increase in VONB of US$30 million, or 35.8% in Thailand, US$16 million, or 48.4% in China, US$15 million, or 26.9% in our other markets reporting segment, and US$15 million, or 38.4%, in Korea. The growth in VONB was led by our traditional life insurance products, with the riders attached to our individual life insurance products our second greatest source of VONB.
     The table below shows ANP by reporting segment for the periods indicated:
 
     New business, as measured by ANP in the nine months ended 31 August 2010 increased in all of our reporting units compared to the nine months ended 31 August 2009, except in Korea. The increase in new business was led by our investment-linked and universal life products, reflecting an increase in customer demand for investment related products in the period. The 37.5% increase in Singapore was primarily due to a successful limited sales campaign of lower margin savings products designed to generate opportunities for future cross-selling and up-selling of higher margin products. We achieved an 11.8% increase in Thailand despite the political unrest centered in Bangkok in the second quarter of 2010. These increases more than offset the 14.5% decline in Korea as we re-positioned our business to focus on higher margin products. Hong Kong's ANP in the nine months ended 31 August 2009 was boosted by a sales campaign in respect of a savings plan, which accounted for US$57 million during that period.
     The table below shows new business margin by reporting segment for the periods indicated:
 
 
     The new business margin in the nine months ended 31 August 2010 increased in all of our operating units compared to the nine months ended 31 August 2009, except in Singapore, reflecting our focus on generating profitable VONB growth. The most significant change was in China, where new business margin increased from 24% to 34%, followed by Korea, where new business margin increased from 15% to 25%. The new business margin in Singapore declined from 63% to 48%, reflecting the limited sales campaign mentioned above, although new business margin for our Singapore reporting segment remained the second highest of all of our reporting segments in the nine months ended 31 August 2010.
     In the three months ended 31 August 2010, VONB increased by US$8 million, or 5%; ANP increased by US$53 million, or 12%, and the new business margin declined from 34% to 32% as compared with the three months ended 31 May 2010.
We cannot assure you that our TWPI, ANP, VONB and new business margin in the three months ended 31 August 2010 will be indicative of our financial results for the full year ending 30 November 2010 or for future quarterly periods.
