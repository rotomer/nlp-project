Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
(a) On December 13, 2010, American International Group (the "Company") sent a notice (the "Notice") to its directors and executive officers notifying them that due to a change in third party provider of administrative services for the AIG Incentive Savings Plan, the American General Agents' and Managers' Thrift Plan, the Chartis Insurance Company  Puerto Rico Capital Growth Plan and the SunAmerica Executive Savings Plan (each a "Plan" and together, the "Plans"), Plan participants will be unable to perform fund transfers, reallocations, provide investment directions, change contribution elections, enroll, make a rollover into or obtain a loan, withdrawal, or distribution from a Plan, during the period beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, December 29, 2010 and ending during the week of January 9, 2011 (the "Blackout Period"). During the Blackout Period, subject to certain exceptions all directors and executive officers of the Company will be unable to trade in Company equity securities and derivative securities if such securities were acquired in connection with employment or service as a director or executive officer of the Company.
The Notice, which was provided in accordance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Regulation BTR, advises the Company's directors and executive officers of applicable trading restrictions. A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. During the Blackout Period and for two years after the end date of the Blackout Period, a shareholder or other interested person may obtain, without charge, information regarding the Blackout Period, including the actual beginning and end dates by contacting Kathleen E. Shannon, Senior Vice President, American International Group, Inc., 80 Pine Street, New York, NY (212) 770-5123.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
From October 2004 to April 2005, AIG shareholders filed derivative complaints in the Delaware Chancery Court in connection with transactions and events related to AIG's restatement of consolidated financial statements. These complaints were consolidated into a single action as In re American International Group, Inc. Consolidated Derivative Litigation, C.A. No. 769-VCS (the Consolidated Derivative Action). On August 25, 2010, AIG entered into a settlement agreement (the "Agreement") with the other parties to the Consolidated Derivative Action to resolve certain claims in those actions as described in the Agreement. Counsel for the derivative plaintiffs submitted the Agreement to the Delaware Court of Chancery on August 26, 2010. The Agreement also contemplates the settlement of related derivative cases now pending in New York federal and state court.
The Agreement was contingent upon funding from director and officer insurance policies ("D&O") from the 2004/2005 period. On November 11, 2010, AIG, the D&O insurance carriers, and certain insureds entered into an agreement which provided that funding ("the Insurance Agreement"). The Insurance Agreement is confidential. Pursuant to the
Table of Contents
Insurance Agreement, the D&O insurance carriers will pay a total of $150 million, of which $90 million will be paid to settle the derivative actions. The $90 million payment, minus the derivative plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and other costs, will ultimately go to AIG.
On November 16, 2010, the Court entered a scheduling order (the "Scheduling Order") approving the form of notice and setting a Settlement Hearing for January 18, 2011 at the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. The Scheduling Order requires that notice of the settlement ("the Settlement Notice") should be given to shareholders of AIG in the form of this Current Report on Form 8-K. The Agreement and the Notice are attached as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

          9. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be, nor shall it be construed to be, a release of any claims by the D&O Beneficiaries against any insurance coverage to which they may be entitled, which is a matter that the D&O Beneficiaries intend to address separately in the written settlement agreement with the D&O Carriers described in Paragraph 1 herein. This Agreement also does not affect, nor shall it be

construed to affect, any rights that the D&O Beneficiaries or any of the AIG Defendants may have to indemnification or advancement.
          10. It is intended and agreed by the Parties that the damages which may be recovered derivatively on behalf of AIG by the plaintiffs in the Derivative Cases against tortfeasors other than the D&O Beneficiaries shall be reduced to the extent of the pro rata share of the D&O Beneficiaries. The foregoing language is intended to comply with 10 Del. C.  6304(b) and NY CPLR  15-108, to the extent applicable, so as to preclude any liability of any of the D&O Beneficiaries to any other alleged tortfeasors, for contribution or otherwise; and any language of this release inconsistent with such intent or with the requirements of 10 Del. C.  6304(b) and NY CPLR  15-108 for the execution of such intent shall be void and of no consequence, and in place thereof it is agreed that it shall be considered that this document contains such other language, if any, as is necessary to make effectual the express intent of the parties as aforementioned.
          11. Counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs agree that they will seek, on behalf of all counsel in the Delaware Derivative Action and any of the cases consolidated therein, an award from the Court of Chancery of attorneys' fees of no more than 22.5 percent of the Settlement Amount, plus no more than $1,000,000 in expenses, to be used to pay for any awards of attorneys' fees and expenses in the Delaware Derivative Action and any of the cases consolidated therein. Counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs shall request that the court's order awarding such fees and expenses specify that any fees and expenses so awarded fully satisfy any obligation by AIG to pay any attorneys' fees and/or expenses in the Delaware Derivative Action or any of the cases consolidated therein.

     If you were a shareholder of AIG as of November 16, 2010, you have a right to object or otherwise be heard regarding the proposed Settlement and the proposed award of attorneys' fees and expenses in the Delaware Derivative Action, and to attend the Settlement Hearing.
     The Court has reserved the right to adjourn or continue the Settlement Hearing, or any portion thereof, without further notice to you other than by announcement at the Settlement Hearing or any adjournment thereof. The Court has further reserved the right to approve the Settlement, at or after the Settlement Hearing, with such modifications as may be consented to by the parties and without further notice of any kind.
     If the Court approves the Settlement of the Delaware Derivative Action, the plaintiffs in the other Derivative Cases will request that those actions be dismissed with prejudice, and may separately request awards of attorneys' fees and expenses totaling no more than $2.5 million.
 
 
Nature of the Case
     The Derivative Cases were brought by shareholders of AIG, derivatively on behalf of AIG, to assert claims against a number of defendants for harm allegedly caused to AIG. The defendants include current and former officers, directors and/or employees of AIG; AIG's former audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"); and several entities that are alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing that harmed AIG, including Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("Marsh"), ACE Ltd. ("ACE") and General Re Corporation ("Gen Re"). The proposed Settlement is only with the defendants who are former officers, directors and employees of AIG. The claims against PwC, Marsh, ACE, and Gen Re have been dismissed and are on appeal.
     The claims that have been brought on AIG's behalf against the Company's former officers, directors and employees arise out of wrongdoing that is alleged to have occurred primarily during the 1999-2005 time period, including allegations of:
 
     The plaintiffs claim that the D&O Defendants' alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and other wrongdoing caused substantial harm to the Company, causing AIG to:
 
Procedural History
     Between October 2004 and May 2005, several shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, asserting claims on behalf of AIG against a number of the D&O Defendants and Marsh, in relation to the alleged bid-rigging and contingent commission schemes with Marsh, the sale of illegal income-smoothing products, the concealment of underwriting losses, and the concealment of AIG's relationships with offshore reinsurers. Those cases were consolidated to form the Delaware Derivative Action, and the plaintiffs' counsel agreed that the consolidated action would be prosecuted by two institutional investors, the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana and the City of New Orleans Retirement System (together, the "Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs") as co-lead plaintiffs.
     In August 2005, the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Consolidated Stockholders' Derivative Complaint which named a number of additional defendants, including additional D&O Defendants as well as PwC, ACE, Gen Re, and certain employees of Marsh and Gen Re. The claims against PwC were for breach of contract, negligence and malpractice, while the claims against the other newly-named defendants primarily related to the alleged fraudulent schemes involving Gen Re and Marsh.
     AIG appointed a Special Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the claims that had been alleged in the Delaware Derivative Action, and the action was stayed until March 14, 2007 to permit the SLC to complete its investigation. As a result of the investigation, the SLC decided it was in AIG's best interests to (a) directly pursue the claims that had been asserted in the Delaware Derivative Action against Greenberg and Smith; (b) seek dismissal of certain D&O Defendants and claims; and (c) take no position on the remaining claims. The SLC caused AIG to move to dismiss the claims against D&O Defendants Eli Broad, Pei-Yuan Chia, Marshall A.
 
Cohen, Martin S. Feldstein, Ellen V. Futter, John Graf, Carla A. Hills, Frank J. Hoenemeyer, Donald P. Kanak, Kristian P. Moor, Martin Sullivan, Edmund Tse, Jay S. Wintrob, Frank G. Wisner, and Frank Zarb. The Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs did not oppose that motion.
     On September 28, 2007, AIG and the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs jointly filed a Combined Amended Complaint in the Delaware Derivative Action, wherein AIG asserted claims directly against Greenberg and Smith (the "Non-Derivative Claims") and the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs asserted claims derivatively on behalf of AIG against, among others, the following D&O Defendants: Cantwell, Castelli, Coello, Evan Greenberg, Jacobson, Matthews, Milton, Mohs, Murphy, Radke, Tateossian, Tizzio and Umansky (the "Derivative Claims"). The Derivative Claims include claims relating to the sham Gen Re transactions, the Marsh bid-rigging and contingent commission schemes, top-side adjustments, concealment of underwriting losses, and improper booking of life settlement transactions and workers' compensation insurance premiums.
     On April 11, 2008, AIG and the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs jointly filed the First Amended Combined Complaint, which did not alter the Non-Derivative Claims or the previously-asserted Derivative Claims, but which asserted an additional Derivative Claim against Greenberg, Matthews and Tizzio, alleging participation in a scheme to rig bids in the municipal derivatives market.
     Motions to dismiss the First Amended Combined Complaint were filed on June 13, 2008. During the course of briefing on the motions to dismiss the Derivative Claims, the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed defendants Cantwell, Jacobson and Umansky from the Delaware Derivative Action, without prejudice. On February 10, 2009, following extensive briefing and oral argument by counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs, the motions to
 
dismiss the Derivative Claims were denied with respect to defendants Greenberg, Matthews, and Tizzio, and granted for lack of personal jurisdiction with respect to defendants Castelli, Coello, Milton and Radke. The Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs subsequently voluntarily dismissed defendants Tateossian, Mohs, and Murphy, among others, who were similarly situated with respect to personal jurisdiction. The Court also dismissed the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs' claims against PwC, Marsh, ACE, and Gen Re based on the doctrine. The dismissal of those claims against PwC, Marsh, ACE and Gen Re is presently on appeal.
in pari delicto
     On February 5, 2010, pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding dated November 25, 2009, AIG, Greenberg and Smith filed a stipulation providing that the direct claims asserted in the Delaware Derivative Action against Greenberg and Smith were dismissed with prejudice, and providing for the release of certain claims by Greenberg and Smith against AIG.
     Further proceedings on the claims against Greenberg, Matthews and Tizzio in the Delaware Derivative Action have been stayed pending resolution of the claims against AIG in the federal securities class action litigation captioned , No. 04 Civ. 8141(JES) (S.D.N.Y.) (the "Securities Litigation"). However, during this stay  and indeed for the past several years  the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs have had access to the extensive document discovery database from the Securities Litigation containing millions of pages of documents, as well as copies of the deposition transcripts from that litigation, which the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs have reviewed and utilized in connection with various amendments of their complaint in the Delaware Derivative Action.
In re American International Group, Inc. Securities Litigation
     On February 11, 2009, the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs commenced the New York State Derivative Action, asserting claims against, among others, Cantwell, Castelli, Coello, Jacobson, Milton, Mohs, Murphy, Radke, Tateossian and Umansky. The claims in the New
 
York State Derivative Action are substantially similar to those that had previously been asserted against these defendants in the Delaware Derivative Action. Motions to dismiss filed on behalf of Cantwell, Castelli, Coello, Jacobson, Milton, Mohs, Murphy, Radke, Tateossian and Umansky have been fully briefed in the New York State Derivative Action, but the case has been stayed while the parties pursue settlement discussions. The settlement that has been negotiated in the Delaware Derivative Action will also resolve the claims in the New York State Derivative Action against Cantwell, Castelli, Coello, Jacobson, Milton, Mohs, Murphy, Radke, Tateossian and Umansky.
     The New York Federal Consolidated Derivative Action and the and actions were filed in New York federal court and involve similar claims to those in the Delaware Derivative Action. The plaintiffs in those New York federal actions agreed in September 2007 to stay their cases pending resolution of the Delaware Derivative Action. The settlement that has been negotiated in the Delaware Derivative Action will also resolve the claims in the New York Federal Consolidated Derivative Action, and against all defendants named in those actions.

     The Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs, in their capacity as plaintiffs in both the Delaware Derivative Action and the New York State Derivative Action, have asserted claims against numerous current and former AIG executives who are insured under certain directors' and officers' liability insurance policies with a total coverage limit of $200 million (the "D&O
 
Policies"). Those AIG executives have claims under those D&O Policies for recovery of their own legal defense costs, as well as for the payment of any settlements or judgments that may be entered against them in the Derivative Cases and in other legal proceedings arising from their work for AIG.
     In an effort to maximize the proceeds from the D&O Policies that will be devoted to the settlement of the Derivative Cases, and thus will flow back to AIG as the beneficiary of the Derivative Cases, counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs engaged in extensive negotiations with representatives of Greenberg and Smith and with the D&O Defendants' insurance carriers (the "D&O Carriers"), including several mediation sessions with a retired federal judge, regarding the allocation of the available insurance proceeds.
     During these negotiations, the D&O Carriers asserted many coverage defenses which, they contended, would entitle them to rescind and/or severely restrict the coverage provided under the policies. After protracted arm's-length negotiations, the D&O Carriers agreed to pay out a total of $150 million of the total $200 million in possible coverage. The Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs and the D&O Defendants thereafter agreed that, of this amount, $90 million would be allocated to the settlement of the Derivative Cases and thus would be paid to AIG (after deduction of taxes, attorneys' fees and expenses, and certain other costs), while the remaining $60 million would be paid to Greenberg and Smith as partial reimbursement of their legal costs.
     The terms of the Settlement are more fully described in the Agreement Between the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana; the City of New Orleans Employees' Retirement System; John Paul Fulco, Trustee f/b/o Lucia Forastiere Irrevocable June Forastiere Backe Children's Trust; Paula Rosen; Thomas McAdam; Bruce G.

     In consideration of the $90 million to be paid to AIG, and upon the Final Settlement Date as defined in the Agreement, the D&O Defendants and all other current or former AIG officers, directors and employees will be released from all claims and liabilities that were, or could have been, asserted derivatively on behalf of AIG and that (1) arise out of or relate in any way to the allegations made in the complaints in the Derivative Cases, or (2) arise out of or relate in any way to any of the events or transactions that were the subject of any of those complaints. The Settlement will not affect any claims that AIG stockholders have in their individual capacities, including claims for recovery as class members in the Securities Litigation.
     The Agreement has been signed by the plaintiffs in all of the Derivative Cases, and, upon the Final Settlement Date, will resolve all claims, cross-claims, and third party claims against the D&O Defendants and all other current and former AIG officers, directors and employees in all of the Derivative Cases.
 
     In accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the D&O Carriers paid $90 million (the "Settlement Amount") into an interest-bearing escrow account maintained by counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs for the benefit of AIG. Upon the Final Settlement Date (defined below), counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs will cause the Settlement Amount (including any interest thereon) to be remitted to AIG, less (i) any applicable taxes and other costs of maintaining the escrow account, (ii) any attorneys' fees and expenses as are awarded to counsel for any of the plaintiffs in the Derivative Cases (and any applicable interest thereon), and (iii) the costs of providing notice of the Settlement to AIG's stockholders.
     The Final Settlement Date is the date on which each of the following has occurred: (a) the Court has approved the Settlement and has entered an order or judgment dismissing the Delaware Derivative Action against the D&O Defendants with prejudice; (b) the courts in the New York Federal Consolidated Derivative Action, , , and the New York State Derivative Action have entered orders or judgments dismissing with prejudice each of those actions against the D&O Defendants; (c) the time for taking an appeal from the dismissal of any of the Derivative Cases against the D&O Defendants has expired, or, if any appeal is taken, the date on which all appeals have been finally disposed of in a manner that does not materially alter the orders or judgments of dismissal; and (d) any awards of attorneys' fees and/or expenses in any of the Derivative Cases have been made and are in accordance with the Agreement.

     It is the intent of the parties that the proposed Settlement, if approved by the Court, will result in the entry of an order or judgment dismissing the Delaware Derivative Action as against the D&O Defendants, with prejudice. Upon the entry of such an order or judgment, the plaintiffs
 
in the other Derivative Cases will similarly request the dismissal of those actions with prejudice against the D&O Defendants. The Settlement shall have no effect on any claims or appeals involving PwC, Marsh, Gen Re, ACE, or any other defendant other than the D&O Defendants.
     The Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in the other Derivative Cases have thoroughly considered the facts and law underlying those actions, and after weighing the costs and uncertainties of continued litigation against the likelihood of success, and taking into account the financial circumstances of AIG, have determined that it is in the best interests of AIG and its stockholders that the Derivative Cases be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, and that those terms and conditions are fair, reasonable, and adequate and in the best interests of AIG and its shareholders.
     The D&O Defendants have denied and continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing and liability, but have nevertheless concluded that further litigation would be time-consuming and expensive, and that it is desirable that the claims against them in the Derivative Cases be fully and finally settled upon the terms and conditions as set forth in the Agreement.
     Counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs intend to apply to the Court for an award of attorneys' fees not to exceed 22.5% of the Settlement Amount, and for reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and expenses not to exceed $1,000,000. In the Agreement, counsel for the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs agreed not to request attorneys' fees or expenses greater than these amounts, and AIG and the D&O Defendants agreed not to take a position on the request.
 
     If the Court awards the full amount of fees, costs and expenses requested in the Delaware Derivative Action, the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs' counsel have agreed to make no request for attorneys' fees, costs or expenses in the New York State Derivative Action. If the Court does not award the full amount requested by the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs' counsel, the Delaware Derivative Plaintiffs' counsel may request an award of attorneys' fees and/or expenses in the New York State Derivative Action equal to the difference.
     Counsel for the plaintiffs in the New York Federal Consolidated Derivative Action, , and agreed to ask the court in those cases for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses totaling no more than $2,500,000.
