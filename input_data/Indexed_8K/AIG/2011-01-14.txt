Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
On January 14, 2011, American International Group, Inc. ("AIG") completed the previously announced series of integrated transactions (the "Recapitalization") to recapitalize AIG as contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2010 (the "Master Transaction Agreement"), among AIG, ALICO Holdings LLC (the "ALICO SPV"), AIA Aurora LLC (the "AIA SPV" and together with the ALICO SPV, the "SPVs"), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the "FRBNY"), the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury Department") and the AIG Credit Facility Trust (the "Trust" and, collectively with AIG, the ALICO SPV, the AIA SPV, the FRBNY and the Treasury Department, the "parties").
At the closing of the Recapitalization (the "Closing"), AIG completed a number of transactions substantially simultaneously, as discussed in more detail below.
Repayment and Termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility
At the Closing, AIG repaid to the FRBNY approximately $21 billion in cash, representing complete repayment of all amounts owing under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the "FRBNY Credit Facility"), and the FRBNY Credit Facility was terminated. The funds for the repayment came from the net cash proceeds from AIG's sale of 67 percent of the ordinary shares of AIA Group Limited ("AIA") in its initial public offering and from AIG's sale of American Life Insurance Company ("ALICO"). These funds were loaned to AIG, in the form of secured limited recourse debt (the "SPV Intercompany Loans"), from the SPVs that hold the proceeds of the AIA IPO and the ALICO sale. The SPV Intercompany Loans are secured by pledges by AIG and certain of its subsidiaries of, among other collateral, certain of their equity interests in Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. ("Nan Shan"), AIG Star Life Insurance Co. Ltd. ("AIG Star"), AIG Edison Life Insurance Company ("AIG Edison") and International Lease Finance Corporation ("ILFC" and, collectively with Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison, the "Designated Entities"), as well as the remaining AIA ordinary shares held by the AIA SPV and certain of the MetLife, Inc. securities received from the sale of ALICO held by the ALICO SPV. The proceeds from any sale or disposition of the equity of such Designated Entities and such other assets will be used to repay the SPV Intercompany Loans and the recourse on the SPV Intercompany Loans is generally limited to foreclosing on the pledged collateral, except to the extent of the fair market value of equity interests of the Designated Entities that cannot be pledged because of regulatory or tax considerations.
Repurchase and Exchange of SPV Preferred Interests
At the Closing, AIG drew down approximately $20 billion (the "Series F Closing Drawdown Amount") under the Treasury Department's commitment (the "Treasury Department Commitment") pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2009 (the "Series F SPA"), between AIG and the Treasury Department relating to AIG's Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the "Series F Preferred Stock"). The Series F Closing Drawdown Amount was the full amount remaining under the Treasury Department Commitment, less $2 billion that AIG designated to be available after the Closing for general corporate purposes under a commitment relating to AIG's Series G Cumulative Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the "Series G Preferred Stock"), described below (the "Series G Drawdown Right"). The right of AIG to draw on the Treasury Department Commitment (other than the Series G Drawdown Right) was terminated.
AIG applied certain proceeds from asset sales to retire a portion of the FRBNY's preferred interests in the ALICO SPV and used the Series F Closing Drawdown Amount to repurchase the remainder of the FRBNY's preferred interests in the ALICO SPV and all of the FRBNY's preferred interests in the AIA SPV ("SPV Preferred Interests"). AIG transferred the SPV Preferred Interests to the Treasury Department as part of the consideration for the exchange of the Series F Preferred Stock, described below.
Under the Master Transaction Agreement, the Treasury Department, so long as it holds SPV Preferred Interests, will have the right, subject to existing contractual restrictions, to require AIG to dispose of the remaining AIA ordinary shares held by the AIA SPV and certain of the MetLife, Inc. securities received from the sale of ALICO held by the ALICO SPV. The consent of the Treasury
 
Department, so long as it holds SPV Preferred Interests, will also be required for AIG to take specified significant actions with respect to the Designated Entities, including initial public offerings, sales, significant acquisitions or dispositions and incurrence of significant levels of indebtedness. If any SPV Preferred Interests are outstanding on May 1, 2013, the Treasury Department will have the right to compel the sale of all or a portion of one or more of the Designated Entities on terms that it will determine.
As a result of these transactions, the SPV Preferred Interests will no longer be considered permanent equity on AIG's balance sheet, and will be classified as redeemable noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries.
Issuance of AIG's Series G Preferred Stock and Exchange of AIG's Series C, E and F Preferred Stock
At the Closing, AIG and the Treasury Department amended and restated the Series F SPA to provide for the issuance of 20,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock by AIG to the Treasury Department. The Series G Preferred Stock initially has a liquidation preference of zero, which will increase by the amount of any funds drawn down by AIG under the Series G Drawdown Right from the Closing until March 31, 2012 (or the earlier termination of the Series G Drawdown Right).
At the Closing, (i) the shares of AIG's Series C Perpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), held by the Trust were exchanged for 562,868,096 shares of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share ("AIG Common Stock"), which were subsequently transferred by the Trust to the Treasury Department; (ii) the shares of AIG's Series E Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the "Series E Preferred Stock"), held by the Treasury Department were exchanged for 924,546,133 shares of AIG Common Stock; and (iii) the shares of the Series F Preferred Stock held by the Treasury Department were exchanged for (a) the SPV Preferred Interests, (b) 20,000 shares of the Series G Preferred Stock and (c) 167,623,733 shares of AIG Common Stock. As a result of the Recapitalization, the Treasury Department holds 1,655,037,962 shares of newly issued AIG Common Stock, representing ownership of approximately 92 percent of the outstanding AIG Common Stock, and 20,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock. After this share exchange and distribution were completed, the Trust terminated pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement.
The issuance of AIG Common Stock in connection with the exchange for the Series C Preferred Stock, the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series F Preferred Stock will significantly affect the determination of net income attributable to common shareholders and the weighted average shares outstanding, both of which are used to compute earnings per share.
Recapitalization Closing Agreements
On January 14, 2011, AIG entered into the following definitive agreements (collectively, the "Recapitalization Closing Agreements"):
 
The Recapitalization Closing Agreements are attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibits 99.1 through 99.5 and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
Distribution to AIG's Common Shareholders of Warrants to Purchase AIG Common Stock
As part of the Recapitalization, on January 19, 2011, AIG will distribute to the holders of record of AIG Common Stock on January 13, 2010, by means of a dividend, 10-year warrants to purchase a total of up to 75 million shares of AIG Common Stock at an exercise price of $45.00 per share. None of the Trust, the Treasury Department or the FRBNY will receive these warrants. For more information on these warrants, see AIG's Current Reports on Form 8-K dated January 7, 2011 and January 12, 2011.
Satisfaction of Conditions to New Credit Facility Agreements
In addition, on January 14, 2011, all conditions to closing under the (i) $1,500,000,000 Three-Year Credit Agreement (the "Three-Year Credit Agreement") among AIG, the subsidiary borrowers party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent; (ii) $1,500,000,000 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Credit Agreement" and together with the Three-Year Credit Agreement, the "AIG Credit Agreements") among AIG, the subsidiary borrowers party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent; and (iii) $1,300,000,000 Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement among a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG ("Chartis"), the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and each Several L/C Agent Party thereto (the "Letter of Credit Agreement" and, together with the AIG Credit Agreements, the "New Credit Facility Agreements"), were satisfied. Accordingly, the facilities provided by the New Credit Facility Agreements are now available to AIG or Chartis, as the case may be. The New Credit Facility Agreements are described in AIG's Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 27, 2010.
As discussed above, on January 14, 2011, AIG repaid to the FRBNY approximately $21 billion in cash, representing complete repayment of all amounts owing under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and the FRBNY Credit Facility was terminated. The repayment and termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility will result in an approximately $3.6 billion charge in the first quarter of 2011, representing the remaining balance of the prepaid commitment fee asset.
Section 3  Securities and Trading Markets
As discussed above, on January 14, 2011, AIG issued 1,655,037,962 shares of AIG Common Stock and 20,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock in exchange for (i) the shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by the Trust, (ii) the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by the Treasury Department and (iii) together with other consideration, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by the Treasury Department, in transactions that were exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
The Treasury Department, as holder of the Series G Preferred Stock, will have preferential dividend and liquidation rights over the holders of AIG Common Stock, and the terms of the Series G Preferred Stock require AIG to obtain the consent of the Treasury Department to pay any dividend on AIG Common Stock or to repurchase shares of AIG Common Stock (in each case subject to limited exceptions). The terms of the Series G Preferred Stock are set forth in the related Certificate of Designations, which was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on January 14, 2011, is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated into this Item 3.03 by reference.
Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
As a result of the Recapitalization, the Trust, which previously held all 100,000 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, which were entitled to approximately 79.8 percent of the voting power of AIG shareholders entitled to vote on any particular matter, is no longer
 
an AIG shareholder, and the Treasury Department now holds approximately 92 percent of the outstanding shares of AIG Common Stock. Accordingly, a change in control of AIG, as determined under SEC rules, may be deemed to have occurred.
On January 14, 2011, AIG filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware: (i) a Certificate of Designations to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation establishing the terms of the Series G Preferred Stock (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated into this Item 5.03 by reference) and (ii) Certificates of Elimination to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation eliminating all matters set forth in (a) the Series C Certificate of Designations with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock; (b) the Series E Certificate of Designations with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock; and (c) the Series F Certificate of Designations with respect to the Series F Preferred Stock (copies of which filings are attached hereto as Exhibits 3.1 through 3.4 and incorporated into this Item 5.03 by reference).

     (a) The aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock immediately following the Closing shall be equal to zero, except that if the Company draws under the Series F Drawdown Right after the Announcement Date and prior to the Closing (other than the Series F Closing Drawdown Amount), the aggregate liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock immediately following the Closing shall be equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate amount so drawn, plus (ii) an amount to reflect a dividend accrual at a rate of 5% per annum, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, on the aggregate amount(s) so drawn for each calendar day from and including the applicable drawdown date(s) to but excluding the Closing Date.

The allocation between preferred units of the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV will be as set forth in Section 4.02(b) of the Transaction Agreement as though the AIA/ALICO Preferred Units purchased from the FRBNY were "Purchased AIA/ALICO Preferred Units" for purposes of the Transaction Agreement, unless otherwise agreed to by the Investor and the FRBNY. Immediately following such purchase, the Company shall deliver such AIA/ALICO Preferred Units to the Investor, along with such instruments of transfer and assignment and other documentation as may be reasonably required to evidence that such AIA/ALICO Preferred Interests have been transferred to the Investor, it being understood that the delivery to the Investor of certificates and instruments substantially the same as those delivered by the FRBNY to the Company, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of transfer and assignment, shall satisfy the requirements of this sentence, in exchange for a

     (b) The Series G Preferred Stock has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; provided that no opinion need be expressed as to subsequent increases in the liquidation preference of the Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Series G Certificate of Designations.

ANNEX C
 
 
The $1.0 billion in Net Offering Proceeds used to make up the Purchase Price is paid to FRBNY but then reduces the Series G liquidation preference when the SPV Preferred Units are transferred to UST.
1
 
 
$2.0 billion - $1.2 billion (amount actually drawn down under Series G) - $0.2 billion (additional amount notionally "applied" to reduce General Corporate Purposes Available Amount, but not an actual payment) = $0.6 billion.
2
$1.4 billion (Net Offering Proceeds) - $1.2 billion (Purchase Price) = $0.2 billion. Because there is a positive liquidation preference on the Series G, this amount must then go to pay it off. For this purpose, the $1.2 billion Purchase Price is deemed to have been "paid" out of Net Offering Proceeds (which also counts as a reduction of the General Corporate Purposes Available Amount) even though it is actually paid from the Series G drawdown. AIG is not obligated to redeem the remaining Series G Preferred Stock.
3
The $0.1 billion in Net Offering Proceeds used to make up the Purchase Price is paid to FRBNY but then reduces the Series G liquidation preference when the SPV Preferred Units are transferred to UST.
4
 
 
$2.0 billion - $1.5 billion (amount actually drawn down under Series G) = $0.5 billion.
5
$2.0 billion - $1.5 billion (amount actually drawn down under Series G) = $0.5 billion.
6
The $0.6 billion in Net Offering Proceeds used to make up the Purchase Price is paid to FRBNY but then reduces the Series G liquidation preference when the SPV Preferred Units are transferred to UST.

and the Rights Holder that, so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect and until all Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full, except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties:
     (a) As soon as practicable and in any case on or prior to (x) the fifth Business Day following the receipt of cash Net Proceeds of all or any portion of the Collateral (other than any Collateral to which either Secured Party does not have recourse at such time pursuant to Section 2(i)(iii) or 2(i)(iv)) or the Designated Interests by the Borrower or any Subsidiary that is not a Regulated Subsidiary or a subsidiary of a Regulated Subsidiary and (y) the twentieth Business Day following the receipt of any such cash Net Proceeds by any Regulated Subsidiary or a subsidiary of a Regulated Subsidiary, the Borrower or any Guarantor shall apply, or cause to be applied, an amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds, to satisfy the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms of paragraph (b) of this Section; , , that (i) if, at the time of receipt of any Net Proceeds of the ILFC Interests, Aggregate Liquidity is less than $6,000,000,000 or such other amount as shall be agreed in writing by Borrower and the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties, then Borrower shall be permitted to retain an aggregate amount of such Net Proceeds not to exceed $2,000,000,000 (taking into account any Net Proceeds of the ILFC Interests previously retained by the Borrower pursuant to this Section) the aggregate principal amount of any indebtedness secured by the ILFC Interests the incurrence of which was permitted by Section 7(c), and shall not be obligated to apply or cause to be applied such amounts to satisfy the Secured Obligations and (ii) Borrower shall be permitted to retain Net Proceeds of the Star Interests or the Edison Interests only if, and to the extent, the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, shall agree in writing to permit Borrower to retain such Net Proceeds and not to apply or cause to be applied such amounts to satisfy the Secured Obligations.
provided

     (b) Any amounts paid on account of the Secured Obligations, including, without limitation, amounts due pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, any other amounts voluntarily or involuntarily paid by the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person, and any cash Net Proceeds of all or any part of the Collateral (other than any Collateral to which either Secured Party does not have recourse at such time pursuant to Section 2(i)(iii) or 2(i)(iv)) generated by any Person upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, shall be applied, without duplication, in the following order of priorities:
     , to pay any expenses incurred or assumed by the Borrower or any Guarantor in connection with such payment (without duplication of expenses accounted for in the determination of the Net Proceeds of such transaction) and to pay the costs of enforcement of the Secured Parties' rights with respect to such asset or assets, if applicable;

provided, however
     Each Pledgor represents and warrants to each Secured Party, the UST, the FRBNY and the Rights Holder that:
SECTION 5
. General Representations and Warranties.
     (a) Such Pledgor is (i) duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction identified as its jurisdiction of organization in Schedule 1, (ii) has all requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted, (iii) is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required, except where the failure so to qualify would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (iv) has the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement contemplated hereby to which it is or will be a party.
     (b) The execution, delivery and performance by such Pledgor of this Agreement and each other Loan Document executed and delivered by such Pledgor on the Effective Date have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate and, if required, stockholder action and will not (i) violate (A) any provision of law, statute, rule or regulation, or of the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constitutive documents or by-laws of such Pledgor, (B) any order of any
 
Governmental Authority or (C) any provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which such Pledgor is a party or by which any of them or any of their property is or may be bound, except, with respect to clauses (A), (B) and (C), where such violation would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) be in conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right to accelerate or to require the prepayment, repurchase or redemption of any obligation under any such indenture, agreement or other instrument, except where such conflict, breach, default or right would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the Collateral, whether now owned or hereafter acquired (except a Transaction Lien).
     (c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Pledgor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Pledgor enforceable against such Pledgor in accordance with its terms, except as limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity.
     (d) Schedule 2 lists all Collateral of the type described in Section 3(a) clauses (i) and (ii) (or in the case of the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV, in their respective capacities as Guarantors, all Securities) owned by such Pledgor as of the Effective Date, and all Equity Interests of the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV owned by the Borrower as of the Effective Date. Except as set forth on Schedule 2, such Pledgor holds all such Collateral directly (, not through a Subsidiary, a Securities Intermediary, Depository Trust Company or any other Person).
i.e.
     (e) All Collateral owned by such Pledgor is owned by it free and clear of any Lien other than (i) the Transaction Liens and (ii) Permitted Liens. All shares of capital stock included in its Pledged Equity Interests (including shares of capital stock in respect of which such Pledgor owns a Security Entitlement) have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. Except as set forth in the Star-Edison Purchase Agreement, none of such Pledged Equity Interests is subject to any option to purchase or similar right of any Person. Such Pledgor is not and will not become a party to or otherwise bound by any agreement (except the Loan Documents) which restricts in any manner the rights of any present or future holder of any Pledged Equity Interest with respect to such Pledged Equity Interest.
     (f) Such Pledgor has not performed any acts that might prevent either Secured Party from enforcing any of the provisions of the Security Documents or that would limit either Secured Party in any such enforcement. No financing statement, security agreement, mortgage or similar or equivalent document or instrument covering all or part of the Collateral owned by such Pledgor is on file or of record in any jurisdiction in which such filing or recording would be
 
effective to perfect or record a Lien on such Collateral, except financing statements, mortgages or other similar or equivalent documents with respect to Permitted Liens and other than those that name the FRBNY as secured party with respect to the FRBNY Credit Facility. On the Effective Date, all Collateral consisting of certificated securities or instruments owned by such Pledgor and required to be delivered to the Secured Parties will have been delivered to the Collateral Custodian in accordance with the delivery instructions provided to the Pledgor by the Collateral Custodian free and clear of the claims of any other Person or security interest therein, other than the Secured Parties or any other Permitted Lien and no Pledged Investment Property owned by such Pledgor will be under the Control of any other Person having a claim thereto or a security interest therein other than a Permitted Lien.
     (g) Immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, (i) AIG and the Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are Solvent and (ii) the Guarantors, on a consolidated basis, are Solvent.
     (h) The Transaction Liens on all Collateral owned by such Pledgor (i)have been validly created, (ii) will attach to each item of such Collateral on the Effective Date (or, if such Pledgor first obtains rights thereto on a later date, on such later date) and (iii) when so attached, subject to Section 3(d), will secure all the Secured Obligations or such Pledgor's Secured Guarantee, as the case may be.
     (i) The information set forth in Schedule 1 as to such Pledgor is correct and complete as of the Effective Date.
     (j) When UCC financing statements describing the Collateral as set forth in Section 3 hereof have been filed in the central UCC filing offices of the jurisdictions specified in Schedule 1, the Transaction Liens will constitute perfected security interests in the Collateral owned by such Pledgor to the extent that a security interest therein may be perfected by filing pursuant to the UCC, prior to all Liens and rights of others therein except Permitted Liens. Except for the filing of such (i) UCC financing statements, (ii) Intellectual Property Filings, (iii) any filings necessary to preserve or perfect the Transaction Liens on any Designated Interest pursuant to applicable non-U.S. law and (iv) other filings as may be necessary to limit or avoid the application of Section 3(d), no registration, recordation or filing with any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution or delivery of the Security Documents or is necessary for the validity or enforceability thereof or for the perfection or due recordation of the Transaction Liens or (except with respect to Equity Interests in any Regulated Subsidiary) for the enforcement of the Transaction Liens.
     . Each Pledgor covenants as follows:
SECTION 6
Further Assurances; Affirmative Covenants.
 
     (a) Such Pledgor will, from time to time, at the Borrower's expense, execute, deliver, file and record any statement, assignment, instrument, document, agreement or other paper and take any other action (including any Intellectual Property Filing) that from time to time may be necessary or desirable, or that the Secured Parties may request, in order to:
     (i) create, preserve, perfect, confirm or validate the Transaction Liens on such Pledgor's Collateral and the priority thereof (including, without limitation, any actions necessary to create, preserve, perfect, confirm or validate the Transaction Liens on any Designated Interest pursuant to applicable non- U.S. law);
     (ii) in the case of Pledged Investment Property, Pledged Instruments evidencing indebtedness owed by any Designated Entity and Pledged Certificated Securities, cause each Secured Party or the Collateral Custodian to have Control thereof;
     (iii) enable the Secured Parties to obtain the full benefits of the Security Documents; or
     (iv) enable the Secured Parties to exercise and enforce any of their rights, powers and remedies with respect to any of such Pledgor's Collateral.
Such Pledgor authorizes the Secured Parties to execute and file such financing statements or continuation statements in such jurisdictions with such descriptions of collateral and other information set forth therein, as the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may deem necessary or desirable for the purposes set forth in the preceding sentence. Each Pledgor also ratifies its authorization for the Secured Parties to file in any such jurisdiction any initial financing statements or amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof. Each Pledgor further authorizes the Secured Party to file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or United States Copyright Office (or any successor office or any similar office in any other country) such documents as may be necessary or advisable for the purpose of perfecting, confirming, continuing, enforcing or protecting the security interests granted by such Pledgor, without the signature of such Pledgor, and naming such Pledgor as debtor and the Secured Parties as secured parties. The Borrower will pay the costs of, or incidental to, any Intellectual Property Filings and any recording or filing of any financing or continuation statements or other documents recorded or filed pursuant hereto.
     (b) Such Pledgor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain any consent, approval or non-disapproval that is required in order to prevent any of its property from falling within the definition of "Excluded Property", and (ii) obtain any rating agency, regulatory or other consents,
 
approvals, non-disapprovals or assurances as may be necessary to permit distribution of any Net Proceeds of any Designated Interest received by any Subsidiary that is not a Pledgor (other than any amounts in respect of which a payment has been made pursuant to Section 4(a)) to the Borrower or any Guarantor in compliance with applicable law and without a downgrade of the financial strength or insurer claims-paying rating of the relevant Subsidiary or Subsidiaries, and upon receipt of such consents, approvals, non-disapprovals or assurances, such Pledgor shall cause such Net Proceeds to be distributed to the Borrower or a Guarantor.
     (c) Without limiting anything to the contrary in the Master Transaction Agreement, the AIA SPV LLC Agreement or the ALICO SPV LLC Agreement, such Pledgor will not (i) change its name or organizational form or structure, (ii) change its location (determined as provided in UCC Section 9-307) or (iii) become bound, as provided in UCC Section 9-203(d) or otherwise, by a security agreement entered into by another Person, unless it shall have given the Secured Parties prior notice thereof and delivered an Opinion of Counsel with respect thereto in accordance with Section 6(f).
     (d) Such Pledgor shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its legal existence.
     (e) Such Pledgor shall pay its indebtedness and other obligations promptly and in accordance with their terms and pay and discharge promptly when due all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or profits or in respect of its property, before the same shall become delinquent or in default, as well as all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies or otherwise that, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien upon the Collateral or any part thereof or any Designated Interest; that such payment and discharge shall not be required with respect to any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim so long as the validity or amount thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and the Pledgor shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and such contest operates to suspend collection of the contested obligation, tax, assessment or charge and enforcement of a Lien.
provided
     (f) At least 15 days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties) before it takes any action contemplated by Section 6(c), such Pledgor will, at the Borrower's expense, cause to be delivered to the Secured Parties an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, to the effect that (i) all financing statements and amendments or supplements thereto, continuation statements and other documents required to be filed or recorded in order to perfect and protect the Transaction Liens against all creditors of and purchasers of Pledged Collateral from such Pledgor after it takes such
 
action (except any continuation statements specified in such Opinion of Counsel that are to be filed more than six months after the date thereof) have been filed or recorded in each office necessary for such purpose, (ii) all fees and taxes, if any, payable by the Pledgor in connection with such filings or recordations have been paid in full and (iii) except as otherwise agreed by the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties, such action will not adversely affect the perfection or priority of the Transaction Lien on any Collateral currently owned or hereafter acquired by such Pledgor after it takes such action or the accuracy of such Pledgor's representations and warranties herein relating to such Collateral.
     (g) Such Pledgor may sell, lease, exchange, assign or otherwise dispose of, or grant any option with respect to, any of its Collateral only to the extent that (i) doing so would not violate a covenant in either SPV Intercompany Loan Agreement or this Agreement and (ii) an Event of Default shall not have occurred and be continuing under this Agreement or either SPV Intercompany Loan Agreement. Concurrently with any sale, lease or other disposition (except a sale or disposition to another Pledgor or a lease) permitted by the foregoing sentence, the Transaction Liens on the assets sold or disposed of (but not on any Net Proceeds arising from such sale or disposition) will cease immediately without any action by the Secured Parties. The Secured Parties will, at the Borrower's expense, execute and deliver to the relevant Pledgor such documents as such Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence the fact that any asset so sold or disposed of is no longer subject to a Transaction Lien.
     (h) Such Pledgor will, promptly upon request, provide to the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, all information and evidence concerning such Pledgor's Collateral that the Rights Holder may reasonably request from time to time to enable it to enforce the provisions of the Security Documents.
     (i) Promptly upon becoming aware of any default hereunder, such Pledgor will furnish to the Secured Parties and the Rights Holder prompt written notice thereof specifying the nature and extent thereof and the corrective action (if any) taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto.
     . The Borrower hereby covenants and agrees with each Secured Party and the Rights Holder that, so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect and until all Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full, unless the Secured Parties and the Rights Holder shall otherwise consent in writing, the Borrower will not, nor cause any Subsidiary to:
SECTION 7
Negative Covenants.
     (a) take any action that would result in a violation of Section 8.01(a)(v) of the Master Transaction Agreement;
     (b) sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the Collateral or any Designated Interest if the contract to sell, transfer or otherwise
 
dispose of such asset or assets by its terms prohibits the assignment to the Secured Parties by the Borrower or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, of the General Intangibles related to any rights to receive payments under such contract;
     (c) create, incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien on all or any portion of the Collateral or any Designated Interest, except:
     (i) Liens existing on the date hereof; that such Liens shall secure only those obligations that they secure on the date hereof and extensions, renewals and replacements thereof permitted hereunder;
provided
     (ii) any Lien created hereunder;
     (iii) Liens for taxes not yet due or that are being contested;
     (iv) judgment Liens securing judgments not constituting an Event of Default; and
     (v) Liens on the ILFC Interests securing indebtedness for borrowed money in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2,000,000,000 the aggregate amount of Net Proceeds of the ILFC Interests retained by Borrower pursuant to Section 4(a), only if at the time of incurrence of such indebtedness Aggregate Liquidity is less than $6,000,000,000 or such other amount as shall be agreed in writing by Borrower and the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties;
less
     (d) take any action (or fail to act in any manner) that would reasonably be expected to negatively affect the value of the Collateral or the Designated Interests; that, for the avoidance of doubt, decisions made in the ordinary course of business in the exercise of the good faith business judgment of the Borrower shall be deemed not to violate this provision; or

SECTION 12
. Remedies upon Event of Default.
 
     (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Rights Holder, in each case on behalf of the Secured Parties, may exercise (i) all the rights of a secured party under the UCC (whether or not in effect in the jurisdiction where such rights are exercised) and (ii) all the powers given by section 30 of the Conveyancing Act 1983 of Bermuda (the "") with respect to any Collateral and, in addition, the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties may, without being required to give any notice, except as herein provided or as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, sell, or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange, broker's board or at any of either Secured Party's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices and upon such other terms as the relevant Secured Party may deem commercially reasonable, irrespective of the impact of any such sales on the market price of the Collateral; that the right of each Secured Party to sell or otherwise dispose of an Equity Interest in any Regulated Subsidiary shall be subject to the relevant Secured Party's or the relevant Pledgor's obtaining, to the extent necessary under applicable law, the prior approval of such sale or other disposition by the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect to such Regulated Subsidiary; and that the Pledgor waives its rights under section 29 of the Conveyancing Act and agrees that section 31 of the Conveyancing Act shall not apply. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, either Secured Party may be the purchaser of any or all of the Collateral at any such public or private sale and shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale, to use and apply all of any part of the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price of any Collateral payable at such sale. Upon any sale of Collateral by either Secured Party (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of such Secured Party or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid to such Secured Party or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and each Pledgor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal that it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. No Secured Party shall be obliged to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. The Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Pledgor hereby waives any claim against the Secured Parties arising because the price at which
Conveyancing Act
provided
provided, further,
 
any Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale, even if the relevant Secured Party accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree. The Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may disclaim any warranty, as to title or as to any other matter, in connection with such sale or other disposition, and its doing so shall not be considered adversely to affect the commercial reasonableness of such sale or other disposition.
     (c) If a Secured Party sells any of the Collateral upon credit, the Pledgors will be credited only with payment actually made by the purchaser, received by such Secured Party and applied in accordance with Section 4 hereof. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may resell the same, subject to the same rights and duties set forth herein.
     (d) Notice of any such sale or other disposition shall be given to the relevant Pledgor(s) as (and if) required by Section 14.
     (e) For the purpose of enabling the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement at such time as the Secured Parties shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, in the event of a foreclosure upon the Collateral,
     (i) each Pledgor hereby grants to each Designated Entity an irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, license to make, have made, use, sell, import, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, perform and display publicly, and otherwise exploit any Intellectual Property and books and records (including customer lists, credit files, computer programs, printouts and other computer materials and records) used by such Designated Entity in the operation of its business or the business of any of the subsidiaries of such Designated Entity, and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof, which license shall be transferable, in whole or in part, in connection with any merger of such Designated Entity or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Designated Entity;
     (ii) each Pledgor shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any third party required to license or otherwise provide any Intellectual Property and books and records (including customer lists, credit files, computer programs, printouts and other computer materials and records) used by such Designated Entity in the operation of its business or the business of any of the subsidiaries of such Designated Entity that is not owned by such Pledgor to such Designated Entity, and if any additional royalties or other consideration would be
 
payable for the grant of such rights to such Designated Entity, such Pledgor shall provide written notice to such Designated Entity setting forth such royalty or other consideration terms (it being understood that, in the event that any royalties or other consideration would be payable to such third party, such Designated Entity shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect to obtain such rights on such terms), and all such arrangements shall be transferable, in whole or in part, in connection with any merger of such Designated Entity or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Designated Entity;
     (iii) the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, will negotiate in good faith a limitation of the duration of the licenses and other arrangements set forth in or entered into pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) relating to any Intellectual Property that is used by such Designated Entity in the operation of its business or the business of any of the subsidiaries of such Designated Entity, taking into consideration factors such as whether such Intellectual Property is primarily used by such Designated Entity, the extent to which such Intellectual Property is used by other Subsidiaries and such Designated Subsidiary's particular requirements during a mutually agreeable transition period following the disposition of the Designated Interests of such Designated Subsidiary, with the understanding that the use of the trademarks "AI", "American International", "AIG" and/or "American International Group, Inc." or any derivative thereof shall be for as short a duration as is commercially reasonable in light of the scope of the use of such trademark by such Designated Entity;
     (iv) each Pledgor agrees to negotiate in good faith any other transition services or similar agreements necessary or desirable to enable the continued operation of the businesses of any Designated Entity and the subsidiaries of such Designated Entity pending and following the disposition of the Designated Interests of such Designated Entity or the Equity Interests of any subsidiary of such Designated Entity; and
     (v) Borrower agrees that for so long as the Release Conditions have not been satisfied, it will not cause or permit any Designated Entity to waive or terminate any of the foregoing licenses or arrangements, other than (A) as a result of a determination by such Designated Entity that any such released or terminated license or other arrangement is no longer necessary or desirable for the operation of its business or the business of any of its subsidiaries and (B) with the written consent of the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties.
     (f) Each Pledgor hereby acknowledges that the sale by either Secured Party of any Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof in compliance with the
 
Securities Act as well as applicable "Blue Sky" or other state securities laws may require strict limitations as to the manner in which the relevant Secured Party or any subsequent transferee of the Collateral may dispose thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in order to protect the Secured Parties' interests it may be necessary to sell the Collateral at a price less than the maximum price attainable if the sale were delayed or were made in another manner, such as a public offering under the Securities Act. Each Pledgor agrees that no Secured Party shall have any obligation to delay the sale or to register under the Securities Act in order to obtain the maximum possible price for the Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Pledgor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may, subject to applicable law, from time to time attempt to sell all or any part of the Collateral by a private placement, restricting the bidders and prospective purchasers to those who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for investment only and not for distribution. In doing so, the Rights Holder, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may solicit offers to buy the Collateral or any part thereof for cash, from a limited number of investors reasonably believed by a Secured Party to be institutional investors or other accredited investors who might be interested in purchasing the Collateral. If a Secured Party shall solicit such offers, then the acceptance by such Secured Party of one of the offers shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable method of disposing of the Collateral.
     (g) If either Secured Party shall determine to exercise its rights to sell all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to this Section, each Pledgor agrees that, upon request of such Secured Party, such Pledgor will, at its own expense:
     (i) use its best efforts to execute and deliver, and cause the relevant Subsidiaries and the directors and officers thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and to do so or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the opinion of the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties, desirable to register such Collateral under the provisions of the Securities Act, and to cause the registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses are required by law to be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements thereto and to the related prospectuses which, in the opinion of the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties, are necessary or desirable, all in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto;
     (ii) use its best efforts to execute and deliver, and cause the relevant Subsidiaries and the directors and officers thereof to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and to do so or cause to be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the opinion
 
of the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties, desirable to qualify the Collateral under state securities laws or "Blue Sky" laws and to obtain all necessary approvals from relevant Governmental Authorities for the sale of the Collateral, as requested by the relevant Secured Party;
     (iii) cause the relevant Subsidiaries to make available to their respective security holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; and
     (iv) do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as may be necessary or, in the opinion of the Rights Holder on behalf of the Secured Parties, desirable to facilitate such sale of the Collateral or any part thereof in compliance with applicable law.
     Each Pledgor acknowledges that there is no adequate remedy at law for failure by it to comply with the provisions of this Section and that such failure would not be adequately compensable in damages, and therefore agrees that its agreements contained in this Section may be specifically enforced.
     Each of the Pledgors acknowledges and agrees that in exercising any rights under or with respect to the Collateral, neither Secured Party nor the Rights Holder acting on the Secured Parties' behalf is under any obligation to marshal any Collateral and may in its absolute discretion realize upon the Collateral in any order to any extent it so elects, and each Pledgor waives any right to require the marshaling of any of the Collateral.
     The Borrower will forthwith upon demand pay to the Secured Parties:
SECTION 13
. Fees and Expenses; Taxes. (a)
     (i) the amount of any transfer taxes that the Secured Parties may have been required to pay on the grant of the Transaction Liens or to free any Collateral from any other Lien thereon other than a Permitted Lien;
     (ii) the amount of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including transfer taxes and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other experts, that the Secured Parties may incur in connection with (x) the administration or enforcement of the Security Documents, including such expenses as are incurred to preserve the value of the Collateral or the validity, perfection, rank or value of any Transaction Lien, (y) the collection, sale or other disposition of any Collateral or (z) the exercise by the Secured Parties of any of their rights or powers under the Security Documents; and
 
     (iii) the amount required to indemnify the Secured Parties for, or hold them harmless and defend them against, any loss, liability or out-of-pocket expense (including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel and any experts or agents appointed by it hereunder) incurred or suffered by the Secured Parties in connection with the Security Documents, except to the extent that such loss, liability or out-of-pocket expense arises from the Secured Parties' gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or a breach of any duty that the Secured Parties have under this Agreement (after giving effect to Section 15 and Section 21).
Any such amount not paid to the Secured Parties on demand will bear interest for each day thereafter until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% the rate applicable to the Loans for such day under the SPV Intercompany Loan Agreements.
plus
     (b) If any transfer tax, documentary stamp tax or other similar tax is payable in connection with any transfer or other transaction required by the Security Documents, then, unless otherwise consisting of expenses payable under Section 4(b) or accounted for in clause (ii) of the definition of Net Proceeds, the Borrower will pay such tax and provide any required tax stamps to the Secured Parties or as otherwise required by law.
     (c) The provisions of this Section 13 shall survive repayment of the Secured Obligations.
     Each Pledgor irrevocably appoints the Collateral Custodian its true and lawful attorney, with full power of substitution, in the name of such Pledgor or otherwise, at the Borrower's expense, to the extent permitted by law to exercise, at any time and from time to time while an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, all or any of the following powers (subject to any limitation on the powers of the Secured Parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement) with respect to all or any of such Pledgor's Collateral:
SECTION 14
. Authority to Administer Collateral.
     (a) to demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all monies due or to become due upon or by virtue thereof,
     (b) to settle, compromise, compound, prosecute or defend any action or proceeding with respect thereto,
     (c) to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of the same or the proceeds or avails thereof, as fully and effectually as if the Secured Parties were the absolute owner thereof, and
     (d) to extend the time of payment of any or all thereof and to make any allowance or other adjustment with reference thereto;
 
that, except in the case of Collateral that threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, the Collateral Custodian will give the relevant Pledgor at least ten days' prior written notice of the time and place of any public sale thereof or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition thereof will be made. Any such notice shall (i) contain the information specified in UCC Section 9-613, (ii) be Authenticated and (iii) be sent to the parties required to be notified pursuant to UCC Section 9-611(c); that, if the Secured Parties fail to comply with this sentence in any respect, its liability for such failure shall be limited to the liability (if any) imposed on it as a matter of law under the UCC.
provided
provided
     Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody and preservation thereof, the Secured Parties and the Collateral Custodian will have no duty as to any Collateral in their possession or control, or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee or any income therefrom, or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto. The Secured Parties and the Collateral Custodian will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in their possession or control if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and will not be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to any Collateral, or for any diminution in the value thereof, by reason of any act or omission of any agent or bailee selected by a Secured Party or the Collateral Custodian in good faith, except to the extent that such liability arises from such Secured Party's or the Collateral Custodian's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
SECTION 15
