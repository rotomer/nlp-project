Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
On March 1, 2011, American International Group, Inc. ("AIG") entered into a Coordination Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2011 (the "Coordination Agreement"), among ALICO Holdings LLC ("ALICO SPV"), AIG and MetLife, Inc. ("MetLife") regarding a series of integrated transactions (the "Disposition") whereby MetLife has agreed to allow AIG to offer for sale the MetLife securities that AIG received when it sold American Life Insurance Company ("ALICO") to MetLife (the "ALICO Sale") pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 7, 2010 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), among ALICO SPV, AIG and MetLife, earlier than contemplated under the original terms of the ALICO Sale. The Disposition will include (i) the sale of MetLife common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and the sale of Common Equity Units of MetLife (the "Equity Units") pursuant to two separate underwritten public offerings (the "Offerings") upon the terms and conditions set forth in prospectus supplements (collectively, the "Prospectuses"), relating to the Common Stock and Equity Units, filed by MetLife with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (ii) the sale by ALICO SPV of MetLife Series B Contingent Convertible Junior Participating Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Interim Preferred Stock") to MetLife (the "Repurchase"). On March 2, 2011, underwriting agreements for the Offerings were signed, pursuant to which AIG and ALICO SPV have agreed to sell 78,239,712 shares of Common Stock for proceeds to ALICO SPV of approximately $3.367 billion, before expenses, and 40,000,000 Equity Units for proceeds to ALICO SPV of approximately $3.299 billion, before expenses. Concurrently with the Offerings, MetLife agreed to the sale of Common Stock in its primary offering that will enable MetLife to complete the Repurchase of all shares of Interim Preferred Stock held by ALICO SPV for proceeds to ALICO SPV of approximately $2.950 billion, before expenses. The Offerings and the Repurchase will close concurrently on March 8, 2011, in each case subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing. Upon such closing, aggregate proceeds to ALICO SPV, before expenses, from the Disposition will be approximately $9.616 billion (including $3.0 billion to be placed in escrow as substitute collateral as described below).
In the ALICO Sale, ALICO SPV received total consideration of approximately $16.2 billion, comprising net cash consideration of $7.2 billion, 78,239,712 shares of Common Stock, 6,857,000 shares of Interim Preferred Stock convertible into 68,570,000 shares of Common Stock upon the approval of MetLife shareholders, and 40,000,000 Equity Units with an aggregate stated value of $3.0 billion. For a complete description of the ALICO Sale and the Equity Units, please see AIG's Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed November 5, 2010.
Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2010 (the "Investor Rights Agreement"), among AIG, ALICO SPV and MetLife entered into at the time of the ALICO Sale, sales of MetLife securities by ALICO SPV were prohibited for 270 days from the closing of the ALICO Sale. Furthermore, the sale of MetLife securities where the proceeds from such sale would exceed $4 billion in any one offering and $6.6 billion in any 180-day period was prohibited.
The Equity Units have been held in escrow as collateral to secure payments in respect of indemnity obligations owed by ALICO SPV to MetLife under the Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the escrow collateral would be released to ALICO SPV over a 30-month period, to the extent not used to make indemnity payments or to secure pending indemnity claims submitted by MetLife. The escrow collateral is governed by the Indemnification Collateral Account Security and Control Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2010 (the "Indemnification Control Agreement" and, together with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement, the "ALICO Transaction Documents"), among MetLife, ALICO SPV, AIG and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, entered into at the time of the ALICO Sale. Pursuant to the Coordination Agreement, the parties will enter into an Amended and Restated Indemnification Collateral Account Security and Control Agreement, the form of which is attached as Exhibit C to the Coordination Agreement, prior to the closing of the Offerings and the Repurchase.
In connection with the Disposition, on March 1, 2011, AIG and ALICO SPV also entered into a letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement") with the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Department of the Treasury") pursuant to which they received the consent of the Department of the Treasury to the Disposition. As holder of the outstanding preferred interests in ALICO SPV and in AIA Aurora LLC ("AIA SPV"), the special purpose vehicle that holds AIG's remaining shares in AIA Group Limited, the Department of the Treasury must consent to certain significant actions taken by ALICO SPV or AIA SPV, including the Disposition. These arrangements are part of the recapitalization of AIG described in more detail in AIG's Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 14, 2011. The net proceeds of the Disposition
 
(in excess of $3.0 billion to be placed in escrow as substitute collateral as described below) will be used to repay the remaining liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's preferred interests in ALICO SPV and then to partially repay the liquidation preference of its preferred interests in AIA SPV.
The Coordination Agreement was entered into with MetLife to effect the Repurchase and to amend or waive certain provisions of the ALICO Transaction Documents in order to permit the Repurchase and the Offerings and to revise current arrangements with respect to the escrow. Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Coordination Agreement:
The Repurchase
Amendments to the Investor Rights Agreement
Amendments to the Escrow and Collateral Arrangements
The Coordination Agreement will terminate on or after March 18, 2011 at the election of any party thereto if the Offerings and the Repurchase have not closed prior to that date, unless extended by all parties.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Coordination Agreement, including the exhibits thereto, and the Letter Agreement, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 2.2, respectively, and which are incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.

(e) Equity Units Valuation Methodology
The valuation agent will value the Equity Units based on the sum of the valuations of the three tranches of the Equity Units. If any of the stock purchase contracts have been settled for MetLife common stock on or prior to the valuation date, the MetLife common stock issued thereunder will be valued based on the market price of MetLife common stock. The valuation agent will value the Equity Units as if the securities were fully-distributed in a liquid trading market with no additional discounts applied (whether for "new issue", transfer or hedging restrictions, or due to the fact that the security is held by one party).
Each of the three tranches will be valued based on the sum of:
For any tranche of the Equity Units, should a failed remarketing lead to an extension of the applicable Stock Purchase Date, subsequent to the first scheduled applicable Stock Purchase Date, the valuation for such tranche will be based on the sum of (1), (2), and (3)
 
above, adjusting (1) for the number of shares of MetLife common stock issuable on the next succeeding applicable Stock Purchase Date (subject to anti-dilution adjustments).
The market price with respect to shares of MetLife common stock on the valuation date means the closing price per share for MetLife common stock ending on such day, or, if no closing price is available for such day, the closing price for the last preceding trading day.
For any applicable tranche of the Equity Units, the All-in Payments means the sum of any interest payable on the underlying senior unsecured note and any contract adjustment payments payable on the applicable stock purchase contract through the applicable stock purchase date.
For any applicable tranche of the Equity Units, the Foregone MetLife Dividends means, for any dividend record date below prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, the product of (i) $0.74 and (ii) 28,232,000. The dividend record dates to consider are:
For purposes of this valuation, the applicable Stock Purchase Date means, for any tranche of the Equity Units, the next scheduled stock purchase settlement date (as defined in the Agreement), assuming the next succeeding remarketing is successful.
For any applicable tranche of the Equity Units, the Applicable Discount Rate shall be calculated as the sum, on the valuation date, of:
The value of the call options will be determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula for European call options.
This Black-Scholes option pricing formula is a function of:
 
The volatility of MetLife common stock for the call option with an exercise price of $35.42 (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) will be calculated as the annualized standard deviation of the logarithmic daily returns on MetLife common stock over the 100 consecutive trading day period ending on the valuation date the applicable Volatility Skew.
plus
The volatility of MetLife common stock for the call option with an exercise price of $44.275 (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) will be calculated as the annualized standard deviation of the logarithmic daily returns on MetLife common stock over the 100 consecutive trading day period ending on the valuation date the applicable Volatility Skew.
minus
Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock Valuation Methodology
At any time prior to the listing of the Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock, the fair market value of each share of Interim Preferred Stock shall be equal to the product of (x) a share of Acquiror Stock valued consistent with section 11.05 (e)(i)(z) and (y) 10. At any time after the Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock is registered and listed for trading on a national securities exchange, the fair market value of each share of Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock shall be equal to the volume weighted average price of a share of Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock on such exchange over the ten trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the date of the determination.

Pledgor agrees to take all actions which may be necessary or advisable under all applicable laws to perfect the security interests created and granted by this Agreement in favor of Secured Party (for its own benefit and the benefit of the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties) and Pledge Collateral Agent against Pledgor, to ensure that the security interest of Secured Party (for its own benefit and the benefit of the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties) in the Indemnification Collateral is a first priority lien, senior and prior in right of claim to any creditors claiming an interest in and to the Indemnification Collateral (except as provided below with respect to the Pledge Collateral), and to ensure that the security interest of Secured Party (for its own benefit and the benefit of the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties) in the Pledge Collateral granted to Pledge Collateral Agent for the benefit of Secured Party (for its own benefit and the benefit of the other Acquiror Indemnified Parties) pursuant to this Agreement for the purpose of securing the Obligations ranks with the security interest in the Pledge Collateral granted to Collateral Agent pursuant to the Pledge Agreement for the benefit of Secured Party.

Liquidation Cash Proceeds
     Upon receipt from Pledgor of a request complying with the requirements of such Section 11.05(a) that some or all of the amount demanded be paid using Eligible Collateral constituting Indemnification Collateral, Secured Party agrees to instruct Securities Intermediary to withdraw the requested amount of cash from the Indemnification Collateral Account and/or debit the requested number of Common Equity Units and transfer such cash and/or Common Equity Units to such account as Secured Party may designate in payment of Obligations with a Fair Value represented by such transferred cash and/or Common Equity Units. Securities Intermediary may conclusively assume, in complying with such instructions from the Secured Party, that Secured Party has received the foregoing request from Pledgor and that the amount of Eligible Collateral to be withdrawn as specified in such instructions is in the proper amount and shall comply with such instructions as soon as practicable.
     The failure of Pledgor to satisfy such demand or make such payment in full (in either case, regardless of whether such demand is permitted by the Indemnification Provisions to be satisfied by Pledgor prior to default by delivering a request to Secured Party in the manner described above that Secured Party debit Eligible Collateral from the Indemnification Collateral Account), after compliance by Secured Party with the terms of the applicable provisions or agreement constituting the relevant Obligations and the terms of the Indemnification Provisions, including, without limitation, any terms relating to the resolution of disagreements regarding the amount or existence of any indemnification or other Obligation, shall constitute a default hereunder. It shall also constitute a default hereunder if, in the case of any payment required to be made under Article II, Section 6.12 or Sections 11.02(a)(vii),(viii) or (ix) of the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement or the non-indemnification provisions of any Ancillary Agreement, or
 
pursuant to the Special Asset Protection Agreement, the Pledgor and AIG shall fail to make such payment in full in accordance with Sections 6.24 and 11.05(a)(i) and (ii) of the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement.
     Upon the occurrence of a default for any of the reasons set forth above, Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Indemnification Collateral, and Pledge Collateral Agent may, for the benefit of Secured Party (whether for Secured Party's benefit or for the benefit of other Acquiror Indemnified Parties) and upon the instructions of Secured Party, exercise in respect of the Pledge Collateral (subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2), in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or in Section 11.05(a) of the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the UCC, or under other applicable law, with respect to such portions of the Indemnification Collateral having in the aggregate a value equal to the amount of the Obligations then due to Secured Party but unpaid (the ""), such value to equal, to the extent Eligible Collateral is applied, the Fair Value of such Eligible Collateral and otherwise to equal such other amount as shall be determined in a manner consistent with applicable law. Any instructions from Secured Party shall specify the portions of the Indemnification Collateral with respect to which such remedies shall be exercised as specified in Section 11.05 of the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement and shall certify that such Indemnification Collateral has the value required by the preceding sentence.
Unpaid Obligation Amount

provided
 
applied to the payment of the Obligations at any time shall not exceed the Unpaid Obligation Amount at such time, the amount of the Unpaid Obligations to be certified to Securities Intermediary and Pledge Collateral Agent; and , , that Secured Party shall not exercise, or cause Pledge Collateral Agent to exercise, any rights with respect to the Pledge Collateral that would breach the covenant set forth in the last sentence of Section 2.2 or that would adversely affect the operation of the Pledge Agreement, any Stock Purchase Contract or the Stock Purchase Contract Agreement.

further
     Pledgor acknowledges that to the extent the Indemnification Collateral credited to the Indemnification Collateral Account or the Pledge Collateral credited to the Pledge Collateral Accounts under the Pledge Agreement is of a type sold in a recognized market, no notice by Secured Party or Pledge Collateral Agent to Pledgor shall be required prior to the sale of any Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral hereunder. In the event such notice is given, neither Secured Party nor Pledge Collateral Agent shall be obligated to make any sale of Indemnification Collateral or Pledge Collateral regardless of such notice having been given. Secured Party or Pledge Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Upon any sale or transfer of any Common Equity Units contained in the Indemnification Collateral, whether upon Secured Party's exercise of its rights as a secured party hereunder or upon the instructions of Pledgor in connection with a substitution of Indemnification Collateral, the Pledge Collateral associated with such Common Equity Units being sold shall, if such Common Equity Units shall continue to be outstanding after such sale or other transfer, be transferred from the Pledge Collateral Accounts to the other appropriate subaccounts with the Collateral Agent under the Pledge Agreement.
     SECTION 2.10 . All rights of Secured Party and Pledge Collateral Agent for benefit of the Secured Party and the security interests granted hereunder, and all obligations of Pledgor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (i) any change in time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Indemnification Provisions; (ii) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations; or (iii) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Pledgor in respect of the Obligations other than full and final payment thereof.

(e) Equity Units Valuation Methodology
The valuation agent will value the Equity Units based on the sum of the valuations of the three tranches of the Equity Units. If any of the stock purchase contracts have been settled for MetLife common stock on or prior to the valuation date, the MetLife common stock issued thereunder will be valued based on the market price of MetLife common stock. The valuation agent will value the Equity Units as if the securities were fully-distributed in a liquid trading market with no additional discounts applied (whether for "new issue", transfer or hedging restrictions, or due to the fact that the security is held by one party).
Each of the three tranches will be valued based on the sum of:
For any tranche of the Equity Units, should a failed remarketing lead to an extension of the applicable Stock Purchase Date, subsequent to the first scheduled applicable Stock Purchase Date, the valuation for such tranche will be based on the sum of (1), (2), and (3)
 
above, adjusting (1) for the number of shares of MetLife common stock issuable on the next succeeding applicable Stock Purchase Date (subject to anti-dilution adjustments).
The market price with respect to shares of MetLife common stock on the valuation date means the closing price per share for MetLife common stock ending on such day, or, if no closing price is available for such day, the closing price for the last preceding trading day.
For any applicable tranche of the Equity Units, the All-in Payments means the sum of any interest payable on the underlying senior unsecured note and any contract adjustment payments payable on the applicable stock purchase contract through the applicable stock purchase date.
For any applicable tranche of the Equity Units, the Foregone MetLife Dividends means, for any dividend record date below prior to the applicable Stock Purchase Date, the product of (i) $0.74 and (ii) 28,232,000. The dividend record dates to consider are:
For purposes of this valuation, the applicable Stock Purchase Date means, for any tranche of the Equity Units, the next scheduled stock purchase settlement date (as defined in the Agreement), assuming the next succeeding remarketing is successful.
For any applicable tranche of the Equity Units, the Applicable Discount Rate shall be calculated as the sum, on the valuation date, of:
The value of the call options will be determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula for European call options.
This Black-Scholes option pricing formula is a function of:
 
The volatility of MetLife common stock for the call option with an exercise price of $35.42 (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) will be calculated as the annualized standard deviation of the logarithmic daily returns on MetLife common stock over the 100 consecutive trading day period ending on the valuation date the applicable Volatility Skew.
plus
The volatility of MetLife common stock for the call option with an exercise price of $44.275 (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) will be calculated as the annualized standard deviation of the logarithmic daily returns on MetLife common stock over the 100 consecutive trading day period ending on the valuation date the applicable Volatility Skew.
minus
Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock Valuation Methodology
At any time prior to the listing of the Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock, the fair market value of each share of Interim Preferred Stock shall be equal to the product of (x) a share of Acquiror Stock valued consistent with section 11.05 (e)(i)(z) and (y) 10. At any time after the Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock is registered and listed for trading on a national securities exchange, the fair market value of each share of Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock shall be equal to the volume weighted average price of a share of Acquiror Interim Preferred Stock on such exchange over the ten trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the date of the determination.
