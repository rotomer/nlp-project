Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          The information set forth under Item 3.03 below of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
Section 3  Securities and Trading Markets
Item 3.03 Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
          On March 9, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of American International Group, Inc. ("AIG") adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the "Plan"). The purpose of the Plan is to help protect AIG's ability to recognize certain tax benefits in future periods from net unrealized built-in losses and other tax attributes (the "Tax Benefits"). AIG's use of the Tax Benefits in the future may be significantly limited if it experiences an "ownership change" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG's ownership (by value) of one or more "5-percent shareholders" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis).
          The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that AIG will experience an ownership change by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of AIG stock. There is no guarantee, however, that the Plan will prevent AIG from experiencing an ownership change.
          In connection with the adoption of the Plan, on March 9, 2011, the Board declared a dividend payable of one right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share ("Common Stock"), held of record as of the close of business on March 18, 2011 (the "Record Time"), or issued thereafter and prior to the Separation Time (as defined below) and thereafter pursuant to options, warrants and convertible securities outstanding at the Separation Time. Each Right entitles its registered holder to purchase from AIG, at or after the Separation Time, one ten-thousandth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share ("Participating Preferred Stock"), for $185.00 (the "Exercise Price"), subject to adjustment.
          The Rights will be evidenced by either the registration of shares of Common Stock on the stock transfer books of AIG or by Common Stock certificates, if issued, until the next business day following the earlier of (either, the "Separation Time") (i) the tenth business day (or such later date as the Board may from time to time fix) after the date on which any Person (as defined in the Plan) commences a tender or exchange offer which, if consummated, would result in such Person's becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined below) and (ii) the Flip-in Date (as defined below); , , that if a tender or exchange offer referred to in clause (i) is cancelled, terminated or otherwise withdrawn prior to the Separation Time without the purchase of any shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, such offer shall be deemed never to have been made. A "Flip-in Date" will occur on the Stock Acquisition Date (as defined below) or such later date and time as the Board may from time to time fix by resolution adopted prior to the Flip-in Date that would otherwise have occurred. A "Stock Acquisition Date" means the
provided
however
 
date on which AIG announces that a person or group has acquired 4.99 percent or more of Common Stock and become an Acquiring Person for purposes of the Plan. An "Acquiring Person" is any Person having Beneficial Ownership (as defined in the Plan) of 4.99 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, but does not include (i) AIG, any majority-owned subsidiary of AIG or any employee stock ownership or other employee benefit plan of AIG, (ii) any Person who is the Beneficial Owner of 4.99 percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock as of the date of the public announcement of the Plan until such time as such Person acquires additional Common Stock, other than through a dividend or stock split, (iii) any Person who becomes the Beneficial Owner of 4.99 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock after the time of the first public announcement of the Plan solely as a result of (A) an acquisition by AIG of shares of Common Stock, (B) an acquisition directly from AIG in a transaction which duly authorized officers of AIG have determined shall not result in the creation of an Acquiring Person under the Plan, or (C) an acquisition of Common Stock (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock) by any underwriter, dealer or initial purchaser from the United States Department of the Treasury for resale in a transaction contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement, dated January 14, 2011, as amended from time to time, between AIG and the United States Department of the Treasury, until, in each case, such time thereafter as such Person becomes the Beneficial Owner (other than by means of a stock dividend, stock split or reclassification) of additional shares of Common Stock while such Person is or as a result of which such Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of 4.99 percent or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iv) any Person who the Board determines has inadvertently become the Beneficial Owner of 4.99 percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock if such Person promptly divests sufficient securities such that such 4.99 percent or greater Beneficial Ownership ceases or (v) any Person who the Board exempts upon receiving, at the Board's request, a report from AIG's advisors to the effect that the proposed transaction does not create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to AIG, or which the Board determines is otherwise in the best interests of AIG. The Plan provides that, until the Separation Time, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Stock, and will be evidenced by either the registration of the Common Stock on the stock transfer books of AIG, or a certificate for Common Stock, if issued. Following the Separation Time, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Rights Certificates") will be delivered to holders of record of Common Stock at the Separation Time.
          The Rights will not be exercisable until the Separation Time. The Rights will expire on the earliest of (i) the Exchange Time (as defined below), (ii) the close of business on March 9, 2014, provided that the Board may determine to extend this Plan prior to such anniversary as long as the extension is submitted to the shareholders of AIG for ratification at the next succeeding annual meeting, (iii) the date on which the Rights are redeemed as described below and (iv) the time at which the Board determines the Tax Benefits are utilized in all material respects or are no longer available (in any such case, the "Expiration Time").
          The Exercise Price and the number of Rights outstanding, or in certain circumstances the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, are subject to
 
adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution in the event of a Common Stock dividend on, or a subdivision or a combination into a smaller number of shares of, Common Stock, or the issuance or distribution of any securities or assets in respect of, in lieu of or in exchange for Common Stock.
          In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-in Date occurs, each Right (other than Rights Beneficially Owned by the Acquiring Person or any affiliate or associate thereof, which Rights shall become void) shall constitute the right to purchase from AIG, upon the exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of the Plan, that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Market Price (as defined in the Plan), on the Stock Acquisition Date that gave rise to the Flip-in Date, equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the then current Exercise Price. In addition, the Board may, at its option, at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, elect to exchange all (but not less than all) of the then outstanding Rights (other than Rights Beneficially Owned by the Acquiring Person or any affiliate or associate thereof, which Rights become void) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Separation Time (the "Exchange Ratio"). Immediately upon such action by the Board (the "Exchange Time"), the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.
          Whenever AIG shall become obligated, as described in the preceding paragraph, to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise of or in exchange for Rights, AIG, at its option, may substitute therefor shares of Participating Preferred Stock, at a ratio of one ten-thousandth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock for each share of Common Stock so issuable.
          The Board may, at its option, at any time prior to the Flip-in Date, redeem all (but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights at a price of $0.001 per Right (the "Redemption Price") as provided in the Plan. Immediately upon the action of the Board electing to redeem the Rights, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Redemption Price in cash or securities for each Right so held. The Board may amend the Plan at any time and in any manner.
          The holders of Rights will, solely by reason of their ownership of Rights, have no rights as shareholders of AIG, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
           As of February 28, 2011, there were 1,803,372,749 shares of Common Stock issued (of which 1,796,711,841 shares were outstanding and 6,660,908 shares were held in treasury). As long as the Rights are attached to the
 
Common Stock, AIG will issue one Right with each new share of Common Stock so that all such shares will have Rights attached.
          The Plan (which includes as Exhibit A the forms of Rights Certificate and Election to Exercise) is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and is incorporated into this Item 3.03 by reference. The foregoing description of the Rights is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan and the exhibits thereto.

Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: March 9, 2011
 

Exhibit 3.1
          We, the undersigned, David L. Herzog and Jeffrey A. Welikson, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Vice President and Corporate Secretary, respectively, of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), do hereby certify as follows:
          Pursuant to authority granted by ARTICLE FOUR of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has adopted the following resolutions fixing the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of a new series of the Corporation's Serial Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon:
     RESOLVED, that there is hereby established a series of Serial Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Corporation, and the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows:
     1. The distinctive serial designation of this series shall be "Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter called "this Series"). Each share of this Series shall be identical in all respects with the other shares of this Series except as to the dates from and after which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.
     2. The number of shares in this Series shall initially be 200,000, which number may from time to time be increased or decreased (but not below the number then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of this Series purchased by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Serial Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. Shares of this Series may be issued in fractional shares which are whole number multiples of one ten-thousandth of a share, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a whole share of this Series.
     3. The holders of full or fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally available therefor, dividends, (A) on each date that dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common
 
Stock of the Corporation) are payable on or in respect of Common Stock comprising part of the Reference Package (as defined below), in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) that would be payable on such date to a holder of the Reference Package and (B) on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the excess (if any) of $925.00 over the aggregate dividends paid per whole share of this Series during the three month period ending on such last day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of this Series on the date, not exceeding sixty days preceding such dividend or distribution payment date, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend or distribution. Dividends on each full and each fractional share of this Series shall be cumulative from the date such full or fractional share is originally issued; provided that any such full or fractional share originally issued after a dividend record date and on or prior to the dividend payment date to which such record date relates shall not be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such dividend payment date or any amount in respect of the period from such original issuance to such dividend payment date.
The term "Reference Package" shall initially mean 10,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Corporation.
Holders of shares of this Series shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided on this Series.
So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in Common Stock or in any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend or other distribution) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid. When dividends are not paid in full upon this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with this Series, all dividends declared upon shares of this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends shall be declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends declared per share on this Series and such other stock shall bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of the Series and such other stock bear to each other. Neither the Common Stock nor any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation), unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or other acquisition) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid.
 
     4. In the event of any merger, consolidation, reclassification or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per whole share equal to the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, that a holder of the Reference Package would be entitled to receive as a result of such transaction.
     5. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of full and fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series upon liquidation, to be paid in full an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the greater of (A) $25,000 or (B) the aggregate amount distributed or to be distributed in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up to a holder of the Reference Package (such greater amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Liquidation Preference"), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all holders of shares of this Series, the holders of shares of this Series as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of shares of this Series upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph 5. above, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of this Series upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of this Series, ratably in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of this Series then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph 5. above before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation to this Series.
For the purposes of this Section (v), the consolidation or merger of, or binding statutory share exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
     6. The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.
 
     7. In addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation, and except as otherwise required by law, each share (or fraction thereof) of this Series shall, on any matter, vote as a class with any other capital stock comprising part of the Reference Package and shall have the number of votes thereon that a holder of the Reference Package would have.
     8. If and whenever dividends payable on this Series and any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with this Series as to payment of dividends (any such class or series being herein referred to as "dividend parity stock") shall be in arrears in an aggregate amount equal to at least six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of shares of this Series, together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of dividend parity stock similarly entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the shares of this Series and dividend parity stock then outstanding shall have been paid and dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment, then the right of the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock to elect such additional two directors shall cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in dividends), and the terms of office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of shares of this Series (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting so required to be called shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of this Series may (at the Corporation's expense) call such meeting, upon notice as herein provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation. The directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. In case any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders upon the nomination of the then remaining director elected by the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock or the successor of
 
such remaining director. If the holders of shares of this Series become entitled under the foregoing provisions to elect or participate in the election of two directors as a result of dividend arrearages, such entitlement shall not affect the right of such holders to vote as stated in paragraph (vii), including the right to vote in the election of the remaining directors.
     9. This Series shall rank as to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up junior to all other series or shares of Serial Preferred Stock unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms of such series or shares of Serial Preferred Stock.
     10. In the event that the Corporation or its agents determine that they are obligated to withhold or deduct any tax or other governmental charge under any applicable law on actual or deemed payments or distributions to a holder of the shares of this Series, the Corporation or its agents shall be entitled to (i) deduct and withhold such amount by withholding a portion or all of the cash, securities or other property otherwise deliverable or by otherwise using any property that is owned by such holder, or (ii) in lieu of such withholding, require any holder to make a payment to the Corporation or its agent, in each case in such amounts as they deem necessary to meet their withholding obligations, and in the case of (i) above, shall also be entitled, but not obligated, to sell all or a portion of such withheld securities or other property by public or private sale in such amounts and in such manner as they deem necessary and practicable to pay such taxes and charges.
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have signed and attested this certificate on the 9th day of March, 2011.

issued after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time (as hereinafter defined) and, to the extent provided in Section 5.4, each share of Common Stock issued after the Separation Time;
          WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Right entitles the holder thereof, at or after the Separation Time, to purchase securities or assets of the Company pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and
          WHEREAS, the Company desires to appoint the Rights Agent to act on behalf of the Company, and the Rights Agent is willing so to act, in connection with the issuance, transfer and exchange of Rights Certificates (as hereinafter defined), the exercise of Rights and other matters referred to herein;

Until the Separation Time (as defined in the Plan referred to below), this also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Tax Asset Protection Plan, dated as of March 9, 2011, (as such may be amended from time to time, the "Plan"), between American International Group, Inc. (the "Company") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Rights Agent, the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of the Company. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Plan, such Rights may be redeemed, may become exercisable for securities or assets of the Company, may be exchanged for shares of Common Stock or other securities or assets of the Company, may expire, may become null and void (including if they are "Beneficially Owned" by an "Acquiring Person" or an "Affiliate" thereof, as such terms are defined in the Plan, or by any transferee of any of the foregoing) or may be evidenced by separate certificates and may no longer be evidenced by this certificate. The Company will mail or arrange for the mailing of a copy of the Plan to the holder hereof without charge after the receipt of a written request therefor.
          Certificates representing shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding at the Payment Time shall, together with the letter mailed pursuant to Section 2.1, evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock evidenced thereby notwithstanding the absence of the foregoing legend. The Company shall mail or arrange for the mailing of a copy of this Plan to any Person that holds Common Stock, as evidenced by the registration of the Common Stock in the name of such Person on the stock transfer books of the Company or certificates representing such shares, without charge after the receipt of a written request therefor.
 
          2.3 .

Exercise of Rights; Separation of Rights
          (b) Until the Separation Time, (i) no Right may be exercised and (ii) each Right will be evidenced by the registration of the associated Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company and the confirmation thereof provided for in Section 2.2, together, in the case of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Payment Time, with the letter mailed to the record holder thereof pursuant to Section 2.1, and will be transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer (whether with or without such letter or confirmation) of, such associated share.
          (c) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, the Rights (i) may be exercised pursuant to Section 2.3(d) below, (ii) will be transferred independent of shares of Common Stock and (iii) the Rights Agent will mail to each holder of record of Common Stock (provided that the Board of Directors has not elected to exchange all of the then outstanding Rights pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) as of the Separation Time (other than any Person whose Rights have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), at such holder's address as shown by the records of the Company (the Company hereby agreeing to furnish copies of such records to the Rights Agent for this purpose), (x) a certificate (a "Rights Certificate") in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto appropriately completed, representing the number of Rights held by such holder at the Separation Time
 
and having such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, or as may be required to comply with any law, rule or regulation or with any rule or regulation of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed or traded ("Trading Regulation"), or to conform to usage, and (y) a disclosure statement describing the Rights. Receipt of a Rights Certificate by any Person shall not preclude a later determination that such Rights are null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b).
          (d) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Rights may be exercised on any Business Day at or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time by submitting to the Rights Agent the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights with an Election to Exercise (an "Election to Exercise") substantially in the form attached to the Rights Certificate duly executed and properly completed, accompanied by payment in cash, or by certified or official bank check or money order payable to the order of the Company, of a sum equal to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Rights being exercised and a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or charge that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates (or, if uncertificated, the registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) for shares or depositary receipts (or both) in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being exercised.
          (e) Upon receipt of a Rights Certificate, with an Election to Exercise accompanied by payment as set forth in Section 2.3(d), and subject to the terms and
 
conditions hereof, the Rights Agent will thereupon promptly (i)(A) requisition from a transfer agent stock certificates evidencing such number of shares or other securities to be purchased or, in the case of uncertificated shares or other securities, requisition from a transfer agent a notice setting forth such number of shares or other securities to be purchased for which registration will be made on the stock transfer books of the Company (the Company hereby irrevocably authorizing its transfer agents to comply with all such requisitions), and (B) if the Company elects pursuant to Section 5.6 not to issue certificates (or effect registrations on the stock transfer books of the Company) representing fractional shares, requisition from the depositary selected by the Company depositary receipts representing the fractional shares to be purchased (the Company hereby irrevocable authorizes each such depositary agent to comply with such requisitions) or, when necessary to comply with this Plan, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 5.6 and (ii) after receipt of such certificates, depositary receipts, notices and/or cash, deliver the same to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Rights Certificate, registered (in the case of certificates, depositary receipts or notices) in such name or names as may be designated by such holder.
          (f) In case the holder of any Rights shall exercise less than all of the Rights evidenced by such holder's Rights Certificate, a new Rights Certificate evidencing the Rights remaining unexercised will be issued by the Rights Agent to such holder or to such holder's duly authorized assigns.
 
          (g) The Company covenants and agrees that it will (i) take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares delivered (or evidenced by registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates (or registration) for such shares (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered (or registered) and fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) take all such action as may be necessary to comply with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended from time to time, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable law, rule or regulation, in connection with the issuance of any shares upon exercise of Rights; and (iii) pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges that may be payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any shares issued upon the exercise of Rights, , that the Company shall not be required to pay any transfer tax or charge that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates (or the registration) for shares in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being transferred or exercised.
provided
          (h) Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to the exercise or assignment of a Rights Certificate unless the registered holder of such Rights Certificate shall have (i) properly completed and duly signed the certificate following the form of assignment or the form of election to exercise, as applicable, set forth on the reverse side of the Rights Certificate surrendered for such exercise or
 
assignment, (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby, and the Affiliates of such Beneficial Owner or former Beneficial Owner, as the Company or the Rights Agent may reasonably request and (iii) paid a sum sufficient to cover any tax or charge that may be imposed as required under Section 2.3(d).
          2.4 . (a) In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time (i) declare or pay a dividend on Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, (x) the Exercise Price in effect after such adjustment will be equal to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment divided by the number of shares of Common Stock including any fractional shares in lieu of which such holder received cash (the "Expansion Factor") that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such dividend, subdivision or combination would hold thereafter as a result thereof and (y) each Right held prior to such adjustment will become that number of Rights equal to the Expansion Factor, and the adjusted number of Rights will be deemed to be distributed among the shares of Common Stock with respect to which the original Rights were associated (if they remain outstanding) and the shares issued in respect of such dividend, subdivision or combination, so that each such share of Common Stock will have exactly one Right associated with it. Each adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be made as of the payment or effective date for the applicable dividend, subdivision or combination.
Adjustments to Exercise Price; Number of Rights
 
          In the event that the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue any shares of Common Stock otherwise than in a transaction referenced in the preceding paragraph, each such share of Common Stock so issued shall automatically have one new Right associated with it, which Right shall be evidenced by the registration of such Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company and the confirmation thereof provided for in Section 2.2). Rights shall be issued by the Company in respect of shares of Common Stock that are issued or sold by the Company after the Separation Time only to the extent provided in Section 5.4.
          (b) In the event that the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue or distribute any securities or assets in respect of, in lieu of or in exchange for Common Stock (other than pursuant to any non-extraordinary periodic cash dividend or a dividend paid solely in Common Stock) whether by dividend, in a reclassification or recapitalization (including any such transaction involving a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange), or otherwise, the Company shall make such adjustments, if any, in the Exercise Price, number of Rights and/or securities or other property purchasable upon exercise of Rights as the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may deem to be appropriate under the circumstances, and the Company and the Rights Agent shall amend this Plan as necessary to provide for such adjustments.
          (c) Each adjustment to the Exercise Price made pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be calculated to the nearest one hundredth of a cent. Whenever an adjustment to the Exercise Price is made pursuant to this Section 2.4, the Company shall
 
(i) promptly prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment and (ii) promptly file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Stock a copy of such certificate.
          (d) Rights Certificates shall represent the right to purchase the securities purchasable under the terms of this Plan, including any adjustment or change in the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, even though such certificates may continue to express the securities purchasable at the time of issuance of the initial Rights Certificates.
          2.5 . Each Person in whose name registration on the stock transfer books is effected upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby at the Close of Business on the Business Day upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price for such Rights (and any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the exercising holder hereunder) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate (or registration) shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.

          (b) after the Separation Time, the Rights Certificates will be transferable only on the Rights Register as provided herein;
          (c) prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock registration) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may
 
deem and treat the Person in whose name the Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock registration) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary;
          (d) Rights Beneficially Owned by certain Persons will, under the circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(b), become null and void;
          (e) this Plan may be supplemented or amended from time to time in accordance with its terms; and
          (f) the Board of Directors shall have the exclusive power and authority delegated to it pursuant to Section 5.14.
          3.1 . (a) In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-in Date shall occur, except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.1, each Right shall constitute the right to purchase from the Company, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof (but subject to Section 5.9), that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Market Price on the Stock Acquisition Date that gave rise to the Flip-in Date equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that on or after such Stock Acquisition Date any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have
Flip-in
 
occurred with respect to the Common Stock); , , that in connection with any exercise effected pursuant to this Section 3.1(a), no holder of Rights shall be entitled to receive Common Stock (or other shares of capital stock of the Company) that would result in such holder, together with such holder's Affiliates, becoming the Beneficial Owner of more than 4.99% of the then-outstanding Common Stock. If a holder would, but for the previous sentence, be entitled to receive a number of shares that would otherwise result in such holder, together with such holder's Affiliates, becoming the Beneficial Owner of in excess of 4.99% of the then-outstanding Common Stock (such shares, the "Excess Shares"), then in lieu of receiving such Excess Shares and to the extent permitted by law or orders applicable to the Company, such holder will only be entitled to receive an amount in cash or, at the election of the Company, a note or other evidence of indebtedness maturing within nine months with a principal amount, equal to the current per share Market Price of a share of Common Stock at the close of Business on the Trading Day following the date of exercise multiplied by the number of Excess Shares that would otherwise have been issuable to such holder.
provided
however
          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Rights that are Beneficially Owned on the Stock Acquisition Date by an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate thereof shall become null and void and any holder of such Rights (including transferees, whether direct or indirect, of any such Persons) shall thereafter have no right to exercise or transfer such Rights. If any Rights Certificate is presented for assignment or exercise and the Person presenting the same will not complete the certification set forth at the end of the form of assignment or notice of Election to Exercise or, if requested, will not provide
 
such additional evidence, including, without limitation, the identity of the Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates (or former Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates) as the Company or the Board of Directors shall reasonably request in order to determine if such Rights are null and void, then the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Rights to be Beneficially Owned by an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate thereof or a transferee of any of the foregoing and accordingly deem the Rights evidenced thereby to be null and void and not transferable, exercisable or exchangeable.
          (c) The Board of Directors may, at its option, at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock elect to exchange all (but not less than all) of the then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(b)) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted in the event that after the Separation Time any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock (such exchange ratio, as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio").
          Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors electing to exchange the Rights, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right (other than Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal
 
to the Exchange Ratio; , , that in connection with any exchange effected pursuant to this Section 3.1(c), no holder of Rights shall be entitled to receive Common Stock (or other shares of capital stock of the Company) that would result in such holder, together with such holder's Affiliates, becoming the Beneficial Owner of more than 4.99% of the then-outstanding Common Stock. If a holder would, but for the previous sentence, be entitled to receive Excess Shares, in lieu of receiving such Excess Shares and to the extent permitted by law or orders applicable to the Company, such holder will only be entitled to receive an amount in cash or, at the election of the Company, a note or other evidence of indebtedness maturing within nine months with a principal amount, equal to the current per share Market Price of a share of Common Stock at the close of Business on the Trading Day following the date the Board of Directors effects the forgoing exchange multiplied by the number of Excess Shares that would otherwise have been issuable to such holder. The exchange of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Promptly after the action of the Board of Directors electing to exchange the Rights, the Company shall give notice thereof (specifying the steps to be taken to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange for Rights) to the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights (other than Rights that have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) outstanding immediately prior thereto by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.8. Before effecting an exchange pursuant to this Section 3.1(c), the Board of Directors may direct the Company to enter into a Trust Agreement in such form and with such terms as the Board of Directors shall
provided
however
 
then approve (the "Trust Agreement"). If the Board of Directors so directs, the Company shall enter into the Trust Agreement and shall issue to the trust created by such agreement (the "Trust"), which Trust shall act as the agent of the Company, all or some (as designated by the Board of Directors) of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) issuable pursuant to the exchange, and all or some (as designated by the Board of Directors) holders of Rights entitled to receive shares pursuant to the exchange shall be entitled to receive such shares (and any dividends paid or distributions made thereon after the date on which such shares are deposited in the Trust) only from the trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement. Prior to effecting an exchange and registering shares of Common Stock (or other such securities) in any Person's name, including any nominee or transferee of a Person, the Company may require (or cause the trustee of the Trust to require), as a condition thereof, that any holder of Rights provide evidence, including, without limitation, the identity of the Beneficial Owners thereof and their Affiliates (or former Beneficial Owners thereof and their Affiliates) as the Company shall reasonably request in order to determine if such Rights are null and void. If any Person shall fail to comply with such request, the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Rights formerly held by such Person to be null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and not transferable or exercisable or exchangeable in connection herewith. Any shares of Common Stock or other securities issued at the direction of the Board of Directors in connection herewith shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock or of such other securities (as the case may be), and the Company shall be deemed to have received as consideration
 
for such issuance a benefit having a value that is at least equal to the aggregate par value of the shares so issued. Approval by the Board of Directors of the exchange shall constitute a determination by the Board of Directors that such consideration is adequate.
          Each Person in whose name any registration on the stock transfer books of the Company is made upon the exchange of Rights pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) or Section 3.1(d) shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on, and such registration on the stock transfer books of the Company shall be registered as of, the Close of Business on the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly exchanged or deemed exchanged by the Company and payment of any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the holder was made; , , that if the date of such exchange and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such registration on the stock transfer books of the Company shall be registered as of, the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.
provided
however
          (d) Whenever the Company shall become obligated under Section 3.1(a) or (c) to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise of or in exchange for Rights, the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors, may substitute therefor shares of Preferred Stock, at a ratio of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock for each share of Common Stock so issuable, subject to adjustment.
 
          (e) In the event that there shall not be sufficient treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the Company to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(a) or if the Company so elects to make the exchange referenced in Section 3.1(c), to permit the issuance of all shares pursuant to the exchange, the Company shall either (i) call a meeting of stockholders seeking approval to cause sufficient additional shares to be authorized (provided that if such approval is not obtained the Company will take the action specified in clause (ii) of this sentence) or (ii) take such action as shall be or necessary to ensure and provide, as and when and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and any agreements or instruments in effect on the Stock Acquisition Date (and remaining in effect) to which it is a party, that each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to receive, (x) in the case of any exercise in accordance with Section 3.1(a), at the Company's option, either (A) in return for the Exercise Price, debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to twice the Exercise Price, or (B) without payment of consideration (except as may be required for the valid issuance of securities or otherwise required by applicable law), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to the Exercise Price, or (y) in the case of an exchange of Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(c), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to the product of the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the Flip-in Date times the Exchange Ratio in effect on the Flip-in Date, where in any case set forth in (x) or (y) above the fair value of such debt or equity securities or other assets shall be as
 
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, after consultation with a nationally recognized investment banking firm.
          (f) The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such changes in the Exercise Price, in addition to those required by Section 3.1(a), as the Board considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.
          4.1 . (a) The Company hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Plan and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, or expense, incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for anything done or omitted to be done by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Plan, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability.
General
 
          (b) The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with its administration of this Plan in reliance upon any certificate for securities (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) purchasable upon exercise of Rights, Rights Certificate, certificate for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons.
          4.2 . (a) Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent is a party, or any Person succeeding to the shareholder services business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, will be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Plan without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such Person would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 4.4. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent succeeds to the agency created by this Plan any of the Rights Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates have not been
Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent
 
countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates will have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Plan.
          (b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent is changed and at such time any of the Rights Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Plan.
          4.3 . The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Plan upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Duties of Rights Agent
          (a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel will be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.
          (b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Plan the Rights Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact
 
or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by a person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chief Executive Officer or any Vice President or by the Chief Financial Officer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate will be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Plan in reliance upon such certificate.
          (c) The Rights Agent will be liable hereunder only for its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
          (d) The Rights Agent will not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Plan or in the certificates, if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or the Rights Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and will be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
          (e) The Rights Agent will not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Plan or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any certificate, if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor will it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Plan or in any Rights Certificate; nor will it be responsible for any change in the exercisability or exchangeability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming null and
 
void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) or any adjustment required under the provisions of Section 2.4 or 3.1 or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights after receipt of the certificate contemplated by Section 2.4 describing any such adjustment); nor will it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or any Rights or as to whether any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights will, when issued, be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered and fully paid and nonassessable.
          (f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Plan.
          (g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chief Executive Officer or any Vice President or the Chief Financial Officer of the Company or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and to apply to such persons for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such person.
 
          (h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in Common Stock, Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Plan. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other Person.
          (i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent will not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.
          (j) :
Tax Compliance
               (A) The Rights Agent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Company, will comply with all applicable certification, information reporting and withholding (including "backup" withholding) requirements imposed by applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative practice with respect to (i) any payments made hereunder and (ii) the issuance, delivery, holding, transfer, redemption or exercise of Rights, Common Stock or Preferred Stock hereunder. Such compliance shall include, without limitation, the preparation and timely filing of required returns and the timely
 
payment of all amounts required to be withheld to the appropriate taxing authority or its designated agent.
               (B) The Rights Agent shall comply in accordance with the terms hereof with any written direction received from the Company with respect to the execution or certification of any required documentation and the application of such requirements to particular payments or holders or in other particular circumstances, and may for purposes of this Agreement conclusively rely on any such direction in accordance with Section 4.3(g).
               (C) The Rights Agent shall maintain all appropriate records documenting compliance with such requirements, and shall make such records available, on written request, to the Company or its authorized representative within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such request.
          4.4 . The Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Plan upon 90 days' notice (or such lesser notice as is acceptable to the Company) in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.8. The Company may remove the Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.8. If the Rights Agent should resign or be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company will appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company fails to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal
Change of Rights Agent
 
or the effectiveness of such resignation or after it has been notified in writing of such incapacity by the incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of any Rights (which holder shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Rights may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise the powers of the Rights Agent contemplated by this Plan and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent will be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company will file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the holders of the Rights. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 4.4, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
 
          5.1 . The Board of Directors may, at its option, at any time prior to the Flip-in Date, elect to redeem all (but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price and the Company, at its option, may pay the Redemption Price either in cash or shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company deemed by the Board of Directors, in the exercise of its sole discretion, to be at least equivalent in value to the Redemption Price.
Redemption
          (a) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights (or, if the resolution of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights states that the redemption will not be effective until the occurrence of a specified future time or event, upon the occurrence of such future time or event), without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right, whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Redemption Price in cash or securities, as determined by the Board of Directors. Promptly after the Rights are redeemed, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.
          (b) The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors will evaluate this Plan annually to determine whether it continues to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders.
 
          5.2 . The Rights and this Plan shall expire at the Expiration Time and no Person shall have any rights pursuant to this Plan or any Right after the Expiration Time, except, if the Rights have been exchanged or redeemed, as provided in Section 3.1 or 5.1, respectively.
Expiration
          5.3 . Any Person who desires to effect any acquisition of Common Stock that might, if consummated, result in such Person beneficially owning 4.99% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock (or, in the case of an Existing Holder, additional shares of Common Stock) (a "Requesting Person") may request that the Board of Directors grant an exemption with respect to such acquisition under this Plan so that such Person would be deemed to be an "Exempt Person" under the definition of Acquiring Person hereof for purposes of this Plan (an "Exemption Request"). An Exemption Request shall be in proper form and shall be delivered by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive office of the Company. The Exemption Request shall be deemed made upon receipt by the Secretary of the Company. To be in proper form, an Exemption Request shall set forth (i) the name and address of the Requesting Person, (ii) the number and percentage of shares of Common Stock then Beneficially Owned by the Requesting Person, together with all Affiliates of the Requesting Person, and (iii) a reasonably detailed description of the transaction or transactions by which the Requesting Person would propose to acquire Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock aggregating 4.99% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock and the maximum number and percentage of shares of Common Stock that the Requesting Person proposes to acquire.
Process to Seek Exemption
 
The Board of Directors shall endeavor to respond to an Exemption Request within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of such Exemption Request; , that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a determination within such period shall be deemed to constitute the denial by the Board of Directors of the Exemption Request. The Requesting Person shall respond promptly to reasonable and appropriate requests for additional information from the Company or the Board of Directors and its advisors to assist the Board of Directors in making its determination. The Board of Directors shall only grant an exemption in response to an Exemption Request if it receives, at the Board's request, a report from the Company's advisors to the effect that the acquisition of Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock by the Requesting Person does not create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Board of Directors otherwise determines in its sole discretion that the exemption is in the best interests of the Company. Any exemption granted hereunder may be granted in whole or in part, and may be subject to limitations or conditions (including a requirement that the Requesting Person agree that if will not acquire Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock in excess of the maximum number and percentage of shares approved by the Board of Directors), in each case as and to the extent the Board of Directors shall determine necessary or desirable to provide for the protection of the Company's NOLs. Any Exemption Request may be submitted on a confidential basis and, except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall maintain the confidentiality of such Exemption Request and determination of the Board of Directors with respect thereto, unless the information contained in the Exemption request or the determination of the
provided
 
Board of Directors with respect thereto otherwise becomes publicly available. The Exemption Request shall be considered and evaluated by directors serving on the Board of Directors who are independent of the Company and the Requesting Person and disinterested with respect to the Exemption Request, and the action of a majority of such independent and disinterested directors shall be deemed to be the determination of the Board of Directors for purposes of such Exemption Request. Furthermore, the Board of Directors shall approve within ten (10) Business Days of receiving an Exemption Request as provided in this Section 5.3 of (x) any proposed acquisition that does not cause any aggregate increase in the Beneficial Ownership of Persons with Beneficial Ownership of 4.99% or more of (i) the Common Stock then outstanding or (ii) any class of stock (as defined for purposes of Section 382 of the Code, or "Stock") (other than Common Stock) then outstanding (a "Five Percent Stockholder") (as determined after giving effect to the proposed Transfer) over the lowest Beneficial Ownership of Stock by such Five Percent Stockholders (as determined immediately before the proposed acquisition) at any time during the relevant testing period, in all cases for purposes of Section 382 of the Code, or (y) any proposed acquisition from the United States Department of the Treasury if such proposed acquisition and all prior and anticipated acquisitions or transactions effected or expected to be effected during the relevant testing period do not result in an aggregate "owner shift" (as defined in the Code) of more than 40% for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. For purposes of clause (y) above, it shall be assumed that within such testing period all of the Common Stock originally exchanged for the Series C Perpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $5.00 per share, has been, or will be, sold.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of clauses (x) and (y) above, all acquisitions shall be taken into account notwithstanding that pursuant to Notice 2008-84 (and any regulations issued pursuant thereto) no testing date may have occurred with respect to such acquisition.
          5.4 . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the number or kind or class of shares of stock purchasable upon exercise of Rights made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock by the Company following the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time pursuant to the terms of securities convertible or redeemable into shares of Common Stock or to options, warrants or other rights (other than any securities issued or issuable in connection with the exercise or exchange of Rights) in each case issued or granted prior to, and outstanding at, the Separation Time, the Company shall issue to the holders of such shares of Common Stock, Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with the issuance or sale of such shares of Common Stock; , , in each case, (i) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued, if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or to the Person to whom such Rights Certificates would be issued, (ii) no such Rights Certificates shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall have otherwise been

provided

made in lieu of the issuance thereof, and (iii) the Company shall have no obligation to distribute Rights Certificates to any Acquiring Person or Affiliate of an Acquiring Person or any transferee of any of the foregoing.
          5.5 . The Company and the Rights Agent may from time to time supplement or amend this Plan without the approval of any holders of Rights in any respect. The Rights Agent will duly execute and deliver any supplement or amendment hereto requested by the Company, provided that any supplement or amendment (other than to Article IV if the rights and obligations of the Rights Agent are adversely affected) shall become effective immediately upon execution by the Company, whether or not also executed by the Rights Agent.
Supplements and Amendments
          5.6 . If the Company elects not to issue certificates representing (or register on the stock transfer books of the Company) fractional shares upon exercise, redemption or exchange of Rights, the Company shall, in lieu thereof, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, either (a) evidence such fractional shares by depositary receipts issued pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it, providing that each holder of a depositary receipt shall have all of the rights, privileges and preferences to which such holder would be entitled as a beneficial owner of such fractional share, or (b) pay to the registered holder of such Rights the appropriate fraction of the Market Price per share in cash.
Fractional Shares
          5.7 . No holder, as such, of any Rights shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of shares or any other securities that may at any time be issuable on the
Holder of Rights Not Deemed a Stockholder
 
exercise of such Rights, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Rights Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Rights, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders, or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until such Rights shall have been exercised or exchanged in accordance with the provisions hereof.
          5.8 . Notices or demands authorized or required by this Plan to be given or made by the Rights Agent or by the holder of any Rights to or on the Company shall be sufficiently given or made if delivered or sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, addressed (until another address is filed in writing with the Rights Agent) as follows:

Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given on the date of mailing, whether or not the holder receives the notice, except notice to the Company shall be effective only upon receipt.
          5.9 . To the extent that the Board of Directors determines in good faith that some action will or need be taken pursuant to, or in order to properly give effect to, Section 2.3, 3.1 or 4.4 or to comply with federal or state securities laws or applicable Trading Regulations, the Company may suspend the exercisability or exchangeability of the Rights for a reasonable period sufficient to allow it to take such action or comply with such laws or Trading Regulations. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue as promptly as practicable a public announcement stating that the exercisability or exchangeability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended. Notice thereof pursuant to Section 5.9 shall not be required. Upon such suspension, any rights of action vested in a holder of Rights shall be similarly suspended.
Suspension of Exercisability or Exchangeability

EXHIBIT B
          We, the undersigned, David L. Herzog and Jeffrey A. Welikson, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Vice President and Corporate Secretary, respectively, of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), do hereby certify as follows:
          Pursuant to authority granted by ARTICLE FOUR of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has adopted the following resolutions fixing the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of a new series of the Corporation's Serial Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon:
RESOLVED, that there is hereby established a series of Serial Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, of the Corporation, and the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows:
     1. The distinctive serial designation of this series shall be "Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter called "this Series"). Each share of this Series shall be identical in all respects with the other shares of this Series except as to the dates from and after which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.
 
     2. The number of shares in this Series shall initially be 200,000, which number may from time to time be increased or decreased (but not below the number then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of this Series purchased by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Serial Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. Shares of this Series may be issued in fractional shares which are whole number multiples of one ten-thousandth of a share, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a whole share of this Series.
     3. The holders of full or fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally available therefor, dividends, (A) on each date that dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) are payable on or in respect of Common Stock comprising part of the Reference Package (as defined below), in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) that would be payable on such date to a holder of the Reference Package and (B) on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the excess (if any) of $925.00 over the aggregate dividends paid per whole share of this Series during the three month period ending on such last day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of this Series on the date, not exceeding sixty days preceding such dividend or distribution payment date, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend or distribution. Dividends on each full and each fractional share of this Series shall be cumulative from the date such full or fractional share is originally issued; provided that any such full or fractional share originally issued after a dividend record date and on or prior to the dividend payment date to which such record date relates shall not be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such dividend payment date or any amount in respect of the period from such original issuance to such dividend payment date.
The term "Reference Package" shall initially mean 10,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Corporation.
Holders of shares of this Series shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided on this Series.
 
So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in Common Stock or in any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend or other distribution) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid. When dividends are not paid in full upon this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with this Series, all dividends declared upon shares of this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends shall be declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends declared per share on this Series and such other stock shall bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of the Series and such other stock bear to each other. Neither the Common Stock nor any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation), unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or other acquisition) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid.
     4. In the event of any merger, consolidation, reclassification or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per whole share equal to the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, that a holder of the Reference Package would be entitled to receive as a result of such transaction.
     5. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of full and fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series upon liquidation, to be paid in full an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the greater of (A) $25,000 or (B) the aggregate amount distributed or to be distributed in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up to a holder of the Reference Package (such greater amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Liquidation
 
Preference"), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all holders of shares of this Series, the holders of shares of this Series as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of shares of this Series upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph 5. above, no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the shares of this Series upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of this Series, ratably in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of this Series then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to paragraph 5. above before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation to this Series.
For the purposes of this Section (v), the consolidation or merger of, or binding statutory share exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
     6. The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.
     7. In addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation, and except as otherwise required by law, each share (or fraction thereof) of this Series shall, on any matter, vote as a class with any other capital stock comprising part of the Reference Package and shall have the number of votes thereon that a holder of the Reference Package would have.
     8. If and whenever dividends payable on this Series and any other class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking on a parity with this Series as to payment of dividends (any such class or series being herein referred to as "dividend parity stock") shall be in arrears in an aggregate amount equal to at least six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive), the number of directors then constituting the Board of
 
Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of shares of this Series, together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of dividend parity stock similarly entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors, voting separately as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock called as hereinafter provided. Whenever all arrears in dividends on the shares of this Series and dividend parity stock then outstanding shall have been paid and dividends thereon for the current quarterly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment, then the right of the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock to elect such additional two directors shall cease (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar future arrearages in dividends), and the terms of office of all persons elected as directors by the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock shall forthwith terminate and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly. At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the written request of any holder of shares of this Series (addressed to the Secretary at the principal office of the Corporation) shall, call a special meeting of the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar to that provided in the by-laws for a special meeting of the stockholders or as required by law. If any such special meeting so required to be called shall not be called by the Secretary within 20 days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of this Series may (at the Corporation's expense) call such meeting, upon notice as herein provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation. The directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders if such office shall not have previously terminated as above provided. In case any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock, a successor shall be elected by the Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders upon the nomination of the then remaining director elected by the holders of shares of this Series and such dividend parity stock or the successor of such remaining director. If the holders of shares of this Series become entitled under the foregoing provisions to elect or participate in the election of two directors as a result of dividend arrearages, such entitlement shall not affect the right of such
 
holders to vote as stated in paragraph (vii), including the right to vote in the election of the remaining directors.
     9. This Series shall rank as to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts upon liquidation, dissolution and winding-up junior to all other series or shares of Serial Preferred Stock unless otherwise expressly provided in the terms of such series or shares of Serial Preferred Stock.
     10. In the event that the Corporation or its agents determine that they are obligated to withhold or deduct any tax or other governmental charge under any applicable law on actual or deemed payments or distributions to a holder of the shares of this Series, the Corporation or its agents shall be entitled to (i) deduct and withhold such amount by withholding a portion or all of the cash, securities or other property otherwise deliverable or by otherwise using any property that is owned by such holder, or (ii) in lieu of such withholding, require any holder to make a payment to the Corporation or its agent, in each case in such amounts as they deem necessary to meet their withholding obligations, and in the case of (i) above, shall also be entitled, but not obligated, to sell all or a portion of such withheld securities or other property by public or private sale in such amounts and in such manner as they deem necessary and practicable to pay such taxes and charges.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have signed and attested this certificate on the ___th day of _________.

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, March 9, 2011  American International Group, Inc. (AIG) announced today that its Board of Directors has adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) designed to protect AIG's substantial tax assets. This Plan is similar to tax benefit protection plans adopted by other public companies with significant tax attributes. As of December 31, 2010, AIG had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $32.3 billion, $27.8 billion in capital loss carryforwards and $4.6 billion in foreign tax credits carryforward.
     "This Plan is designed to protect AIG's valuable tax assets by reducing the likelihood of an unintended ownership change' through actions involving AIG's securities," said Robert S. Miller, AIG Chairman. "The Plan is particularly important as the U.S. Department of the Treasury begins to reduce its position in AIG."
     AIG's ability to use its tax attributes may be significantly limited if there were an "ownership change" as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and related Internal Revenue Service pronouncements. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG's ownership (by value) of one or more "5-percent shareholders" (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis).
     As part of the Plan, the AIG Board of Directors today declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding share of AIG common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG common stock). The Rights will be distributable to shareholders of record as of March 18, 2011, as well as to holders of AIG common stock issued after that date.
     The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that AIG will experience an ownership change by discouraging any person from becoming a 5-percent shareholder. There is no guarantee, however, that the Plan will prevent AIG from experiencing an ownership change. AIG may pursue other ways to protect AIG's substantial tax assets.
     AIG's Board of Directors has the discretion under certain circumstances to exempt acquisitions of AIG securities from the provisions of the Plan. The Plan may be amended by the Board at any time. AIG expects to ask shareholders to ratify the Plan at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The issuance of the Rights will not affect AIG's reported earnings per share and is not taxable to AIG or its shareholders.
 
     Additional information regarding the Plan will be contained in a Form 8-K and in a Registration Statement on Form 8-A that AIG is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect AIG's current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Except for AIG's ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws, it does not intend to provide an update concerning any future revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof.
     American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading international insurance organization serving customers in more than 130 countries. AIG companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG companies are leading providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States. AIG common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the stock exchanges in Ireland and Tokyo.
