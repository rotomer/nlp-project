Tax Asset Protection Plan; (v) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as AIG's independent registered public accounting firm for 2011; and (vi) a shareholder proposal relating to restricting hedging transactions.
The shareholders elected all fourteen director nominees, approved the non-binding shareholder resolution to approve executive compensation, approved the proposal to amend AIG's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to restrict certain transfers of AIG Common Stock in order to protect AIG's tax attributes, ratified the American International Group, Inc.

     (4) Except as provided in the resolutions of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof in establishing the terms of a series of Serial Preferred Stock, so long as any shares of UST Preferred Stock and any series of Serial Preferred Stock ranking on a parity therewith as to dividends shall be outstanding, in no event shall any dividend, whether in cash or property, be paid or declared, nor shall any distribution be made, on any junior stock or Junior Preferred Stock, nor shall any shares of any junior stock or Junior Preferred Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for value by the Company, unless all dividends on the UST Preferred Stock and any series of Serial Preferred Stock ranking on a parity with the UST Preferred Stock as to dividends for all past dividend periods and for the then current period shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart, and unless the Company shall not be in default with respect to any of its obligations with respect to any past period with respect to any sinking fund for the UST Preferred Stock or any Serial Preferred Stock ranking on a parity therewith as to dividends.

     (a) Any Transfer of Company Securities that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to Section 2(a) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall nonetheless be permitted if (i) prior to such Transfer being consummated (or, in the case of an involuntary Transfer, as soon as practicable after the transaction is consummated), the Board of Directors approves the Transfer in accordance with Section 3(b) or 3(c) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN (such approval may relate to a Transfer or series of identified Transfers and may provide the effective time of such transfer which could be retroactive), (ii) such Transfer is pursuant to any transaction, including, but not limited to, a merger, consolidation, mandatory share exchange or other business combination in which all holders of Company Securities receive, or are offered the same opportunity to receive, cash or other consideration for all such Company Securities, and upon the consummation of which the acquiror owns at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, (iii) such Transfer is a Transfer to any employee stock ownership or other employee benefit plan of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (or any entity or trustee holding shares of Common Stock for or pursuant

     (b) The restrictions contained in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN are for the purposes of reducing the risk that any "ownership change" (as defined in the Code) with respect to the Company may limit the Company's ability to utilize its Tax Benefits. The restrictions set forth in Section 2(a) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall not apply to a proposed Transfer that is a Five Percent Transaction if the Transferor or the Transferee obtains the authorization of the Board of Directors in the manner described below. In connection therewith, and to provide for effective policing of these provisions, any Person who desires to effect a transaction that may be a Five Percent Transaction (a "Requesting Person") shall, prior to the date of such transaction for which the Requesting Person seeks authorization (the "Proposed Transaction"), request in writing (a "Request") that the Board of Directors review the Proposed Transaction and authorize or not authorize the Proposed Transaction in accordance with this Section 3(b). A Request shall be delivered by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive office. Such Request shall be deemed to have been made when actually received by the Company. A Request shall include: (i) the name and address and telephone number of the Requesting Person; (ii) the number and percentage of Company Securities then Beneficially Owned by the Requesting Person and (iii) a reasonably detailed description of the Proposed Transaction or Proposed Transactions by which the Requesting Person would propose to effect a Five Percent Transaction and the proposed tax treatment thereof. The Board of Directors shall, in good faith, endeavor to respond to a Request within twenty (20) Business Days of receiving such Request; provided that the failure of the Board of Directors to make a determination within such period shall be deemed to constitute the denial by the Board of Directors of the Request. The Requesting Person shall respond promptly to reasonable and appropriate requests for additional information from the Company or the Board of Directors and its advisors to assist the Board of Directors in making its determination. The Board of Directors shall only authorize a Proposed Transaction if it receives, at the Board's request, a report from the Company's advisors to the effect that the Proposed Transaction does not
 
create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Board of Directors otherwise determines in its sole discretion that granting the Request is in the best interests of the Company. Any Request may be submitted on a confidential basis and, except to the extent required by applicable law, the Company shall maintain the confidentiality of such Request and the determination of the Board of Directors with respect thereto, unless the information contained in the Request or the determination of the Board of Directors with respect thereto otherwise becomes publicly available. The Request shall be considered and evaluated by directors serving on the Board of Directors who are independent of the Company and the Requesting Person and disinterested with respect to the Request, who shall constitute a committee of the Board for this purpose, and the action of a majority of such independent and disinterested directors, or any committee of the Board consisting solely of these directors, shall be deemed to be the determination of the Board of Directors for purposes of such Request. Furthermore, the Board of Directors shall approve within ten (10) Business Days of receiving a Request as provided in this Section 3(b) of (x) any proposed Transfer that does not cause any aggregate increase in the Beneficial Ownership of Stock by Five Percent Stockholders (as determined after giving effect to the proposed Transfer) over the lowest Beneficial Ownership of Stock by such Five Percent Stockholders (as determined immediately before the proposed Transfer) at any time during the relevant testing period, in all cases for purposes of Section 382 of the Code, or (y) any proposed Transfer by the United States Department of the Treasury if such proposed Transfer and all prior and anticipated Transfers or other transactions effected or expected to be effected during the relevant testing period do not result in an aggregate "owner shift" (as defined in the Code) of more than 40% for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. For purposes of clause (y) above, it shall be assumed that within such testing period all of the Common Stock originally exchanged for the Series C Perpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock of the Company, par value $5.00 per share, has been, or will be, sold. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of clauses (x) and (y) above, all Transfers shall be taken into account notwithstanding that pursuant to Notice 2008-84 (and any regulations issued pursuant thereto) no testing date may have occurred with respect to such Transfer.
     (c) In addition to Section 3(b), the Board of Directors may determine that the restrictions set forth in Section 2(a) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall not apply to any particular transaction or transactions, whether or not a request has been made to the Board of Directors, including a Request pursuant to Section 3(b) of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, subject to any conditions that it deems reasonable and appropriate in connection therewith. Any determination of the Board of Directors hereunder may be made prospectively or retroactively.
 
     (d) The Board of Directors, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may exercise the authority granted by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN through duly authorized officers or agents of the Company.
     (4) .
Excess Securities
     (a) No employee or agent of the Company shall record any Prohibited Transfer, and the purported Transferee of such a Prohibited Transfer (the "Purported Transferee") shall not be recognized as a stockholder of the Company for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Company Securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the "Excess Securities"). Until the Excess Securities are acquired by another Person in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall not be entitled to any rights thereunder, including rights of stockholders of the Company with respect to such Excess Securities, including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any, and the Excess Securities shall be deemed to remain with the Transferor unless and until the Excess Securities are transferred to the Agent pursuant to Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN or until an approval is obtained under Section 3 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. After the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the Company Securities shall cease to be Excess Securities. For this purpose, any Transfer of Excess Securities not in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4 or Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall also be a Prohibited Transfer.
     (b) The Company may make such arrangements or issue such instructions to its stock transfer agent as may be determined by the Board of Directors to be necessary or advisable to implement this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, including, without limitation, authorizing, in accordance with Section 9 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, such transfer agent to require an affidavit from a Purported Transferee regarding such Person's Beneficial Ownership of Stock and other evidence that a Transfer will not be prohibited by this ARTICLE THIRTEEN as a condition to registering any Transfer.
     (5) . If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer of Company Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written demand by the Company sent within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Board of Directors determines that the attempted Transfer constitutes a Prohibited Transfer, the Purported Transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the Purported Transferee's possession or control, together with any Prohibited Distributions, or, in the case of uncertificated Stock, shall
Transfer to Agent
 
automatically be deemed to be transferred to an agent designated by the Board of Directors (the "Agent"). The Agent shall thereupon sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the Company, the Excess Securities transferred to it in one or more arm's-length transactions (on the public securities market on which such Excess Securities are traded, if possible, or otherwise privately); , , that any such sale must not constitute a Prohibited Transfer; and that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time frame if, in the Agent's discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the market for the Company Securities, would otherwise adversely affect the value of the Company Securities or would be in violation of applicable securities laws. If the Purported Transferee has resold the Excess Securities before receiving the Company's demand to surrender Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported Transferee shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities for the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the Agent any Prohibited Distributions and proceeds of such sale, except to the extent that the Company grants written permission to the Purported Transferee to retain a portion of such sales proceeds and Prohibited Distributions not exceeding the amount that the Purported Transferee would have received from the Agent pursuant to Section 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN if the Agent rather than the Purported Transferee had resold the Excess Securities for an amount equal to the proceeds of such sale by the Purported Transferee (and taking into account only the actual costs incurred by the Agent).

provided
further
     (6) . The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities and, if the Purported Transferee has previously resold the Excess Securities, any amounts received by the Agent from a Purported Transferee, together, in either case, with any Prohibited Distributions, as follows: (a) first, such amounts shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs and expenses incurred in connection with its duties hereunder; (b) second, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee, up to the amount paid by the Purported Transferee for the Excess Securities (or the Market Price at the time of the Transfer, in the event the purported Transfer of the Excess Securities was, in whole or in part, a gift, inheritance or similar Transfer); and (c) third, any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Transferor that was party to the subject Prohibited Transfer, or, if the Transferor that was party to the subject Prohibited Transfer cannot be readily identified, to one or more organizations qualifying under section 501(c)(3) of the Code (or any comparable successor provision) selected by the Board of Directors. The Purported Transferee of Excess Securities shall have no claim, cause of action or any other recourse whatsoever against any Transferor of Excess Securities. The Purported Transferee's sole right with respect to such shares shall be limited to the amount payable to the Purported Transferee pursuant to this Section 6. In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess Securities pursuant to this Section 6 inure to the benefit of
Application of Proceeds and Prohibited Distributions
 
the Company or the Agent, except to the extent used to cover costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in performing its duties hereunder.
     (7) . In the event of any Transfer that does not involve a transfer of securities of the Company within the meaning of Delaware law ("Securities," and individually, a "Security") but which would cause the transferee or any other Person to become a Five Percent Stockholder, or would cause the Beneficial Ownership of a Five Percent Stockholder to increase, the application of Section 5 and Section 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN shall be modified as described in this Section 7. In such case, no such Five Percent Stockholder shall be required to dispose of any interest that is not a Security, but such Five Percent Stockholder and/or any Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such Five Percent Stockholder shall be deemed to have disposed of and shall be required to dispose of sufficient Securities (which Securities shall be disposed of in the inverse order in which they were acquired) to cause such Five Percent Stockholder, following such disposition, not to be in violation of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. Such disposition shall be deemed to occur simultaneously with the Transfer giving rise to the application of this provision, and such number of Securities that are deemed to be disposed of shall be considered Excess Securities and shall be disposed of through the Agent as provided in Sections 5 and 6 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, except that the maximum aggregate amount payable either to such Five Percent Stockholder, or to such other Person that was the direct holder of such Excess Securities, in connection with such sale shall be the Market Price of such Excess Securities at the time of the purported Transfer. All expenses incurred by the Agent in disposing of such Excess Securities shall be paid out of any amounts due such Five Percent Stockholder or such other Person. The purpose of this Section 7 is to extend the restrictions in Sections 2 and 4 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN to situations in which there is a Five Percent Transaction without a direct Transfer of Securities, and this Section 7, along with the other provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN, shall be interpreted to produce the same results, with differences as the context requires, as a direct Transfer of Company Securities.
Modification of Remedies for Certain Indirect Transfers
     (8) . If the Purported Transferee fails to surrender the Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof, in either case, with any Prohibited Distributions, to the Agent within thirty (30) days from the date on which the Company makes a written demand pursuant to Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN (whether or not made within the time specified in Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN), then the Company may take any actions it deems necessary to enforce the provisions hereof, including the institution of legal proceedings to compel the surrender. Nothing in this Section 8 shall (a) be deemed inconsistent with any Transfer of the Excess Securities provided in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN being void , (b) preclude the Company in its discretion from immediately bringing legal proceedings without a prior demand or (c) cause any failure of the
Legal Proceedings; Prompt Enforcement
ab initio
 
Company to act within the time periods set forth in Section 5 of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN to constitute a waiver or loss of any right of the Company under this ARTICLE THIRTEEN. The Board of Directors may authorize such additional actions as it deems advisable to give effect to the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEEN.
     (9) . As a condition to the registration of the Transfer of any Stock, any Person who is a beneficial, legal or record holder of Stock, and any proposed Transferee and any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the proposed Transferee, shall provide such information, to the extent reasonably available and legally permissible, as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to determine compliance with this ARTICLE THIRTEEN or the status of the Tax Benefits of the Company.
Obligation to Provide Information
     (10) . The Board of Directors may require that the registration of the Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company, or any certificates issued by the Company evidencing ownership of shares of Stock that are subject to the restrictions on transfer and ownership contained in this ARTICLE THIRTEEN bear the following legend:
